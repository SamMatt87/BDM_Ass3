7,2,0,Software recommendations are hard on SE but I could see this being useful to this community.,2017-05-23T14:22:59.063,7
14,2,1,very useful. This is a huge concern.,2017-05-23T14:34:40.610,21
15,2,0,To note it there's an [SE for Software Recommendations](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com).  But I'm not suggesting that this is off-topic since it seems like a helpful type of question.,2017-05-23T14:36:16.600,39
16,2,0,I agree that this question can be problematic for SE but it is also extremely important.  How do other SEs deal with such list-format questions?  Surely there must be some mechanism on [matheducators](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/).,2017-05-23T14:36:25.217,27
17,10,2,I do like the idea of injecting a little bit of project management into the assignment. That's also an interesting note about there possibly being value in testing their ability to spot people not contributing.,2017-05-23T14:36:42.540,7
21,2,0,_@Choirbean This is how most sites handle it: [Meta Math Educators](https://matheducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101/books-and-materials-recommendations). They typically say focused but have their own cultural way of determining what focused means.,2017-05-23T14:50:08.280,7
24,10,2,_@Adam That sounds like the start of an interesting answer.,2017-05-23T14:53:11.240,7
25,14,1,any specific context? college? high school? etc?,2017-05-23T14:53:35.080,49
27,14,0,I am wary of making the site too US-centric.  Is there a better way to designate this?,2017-05-23T14:54:54.023,27

34,14,0,_@Choirbean Can you care to expand on what you mean about labs. Like cheating off of other students?,2017-05-23T14:57:24.140,46
38,14,0,A more specific example will make for an easier to answer question. Particularly in the closed beta it's very easy to jump in with over-generalised questions rather than relating the question to a specific example.,2017-05-23T15:01:53.160,41
39,17,0,Do you have any specific language you are using?,2017-05-23T15:02:26.913,46
40,17,7,This is language agnostic I'm really looking forward to ways for students to grasp the concept of recusion,2017-05-23T15:03:14.630,48
41,6,0,I am a student can you give me an example?,2017-05-23T15:05:51.840,56
42,7,2,It seems to me that you need some programming language to actually run things and test ideas.  It is one thing to understand what makes something work and another to actually execute it.,2017-05-23T15:07:37.473,21
44,17,0,How about [Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)?,2017-05-23T15:08:45.480,56
45,17,0,Fractals are nice but it doesn't get away from my problem of not having an end state / goal,2017-05-23T15:09:31.047,48
46,2,1,I see this as a GOOD question about tool and workflow with a splash of pedagogy. For that reason I'd find it more valuable to keep this question here on the CS Ed site rather than on SE for Software Recs.,2017-05-23T15:11:24.863,50
48,14,0,I think it would be hard to detect cheating for simple programs because of the reason you mentioned. But how about you ask them to write comment next to each statement as to why they wrote it? Everyone should explain it their own terms?,2017-05-23T15:13:13.460,56
50,22,2,Hi Marc I like these can you expand on how you would use any of these? For example (and rather simply) the tree: for branch if water available grow branch split branch in two.,2017-05-23T15:15:29.930,48

56,29,0,I already grade labs through code interviews so much of this is easy for me to implement.  I also *love* your notion for how to set up different assignments.  I'm going to set up a new question to ask about that specifically because I think it deserves its own discussion.,2017-05-23T15:30:04.390,27
57,11,2,If you're teaching a first Hello World program there will often be mysterious syntax that the kids won't understand at first.  `System.out.println(hello world);` `printf(hello world\n);` `putStrLn Hello World` pick your poison.,2017-05-23T15:33:03.647,27
58,29,0,_@Chiorbean yeah the screen checks and the differing assignments were the two changes for me that had the biggest impact.  Especially for introductory assignments tweaking the lab is trivial for us the teachers but for the students it seems like entirely different assignments and really demotivates the urge to copy.,2017-05-23T15:33:05.940,49
59,35,0,better to teach client side first because more interactive easier and much less chance to accidentally screw up.,2017-05-23T15:38:03.943,70
60,11,1,And this is a big problem. You will want to keep the number of exotic symbols to a minimum. Why `::` not just `:`? What is `<`? What is `std` and why not just call it `Standard` then? I saw my brother use `=` when he was programming was he doing it wrong? Etc... There is a difference between a brainfuck code and `print hello world` or   `program HelloWorld;` `begin` `writeln('Hello World');` `end.`. Human readability is important.,2017-05-23T15:40:36.130,51
62,32,1,Is it possible that the scare intimidation factor is a modern myth?  Or perhaps a result using too high a level language for too long?  The CARDIAC computer fit on one sheet of cardboard and a class of  (IIRC) mostly non-STEM undergrads seemed to have no problems with programming it for an assignment.  And plenty (perhaps tens to hundreds of thousands?) of 14-17 year old kids learned to poke 6502 asm instructions.,2017-05-23T15:55:40.307,59
63,32,1,_@hotpaw2 I think it'll be hard to find an answer to that but it's an interesting idea. I'd conjecture it's more a case of I only learned 6502 assembly so it was easy for me being said by those who **did** thrive and anyone who was unable to make the jump simply dropped out and gave up completely. I'll have a look round to see if I can find any research about how students learn in assembly compared to a higher language though.,2017-05-23T16:01:34.347,2
64,44,2,which programming language are you focusing on ? like python web development,2017-05-23T16:02:22.937,73
65,44,0,Sorry should have said front-end web development HTML CSS and maybe a bit of JS,2017-05-23T16:03:16.583,55
67,40,1,I find your last paragraph gives the impression that markup could go some of the way towards providing a computational engine - so risking re-enforcing the confusion. Markup/code isn't apples/oranges its more apples/coal.,2017-05-23T16:13:53.263,41
68,48,2,+1: A simpler IDE such as Notepad++ gives you enough help while forcing you to learn,2017-05-23T16:16:50.227,35

74,22,3,Your examples are missing a purpose. It may seem obvious but I'm not sure the snail shell example works as well as 'fill a volume of soil with uniform root density',2017-05-23T17:02:46.257,41
77,70,0,Does 'having lost hours of coding through not using backups' count as a reason?,2017-05-23T17:36:49.803,41
78,70,0,Yeah probably should :) I've certainly had students accidentally delete things they're working on.,2017-05-23T17:40:25.970,30
83,75,0,I've looked for this before but I never found it.  In your experience practically speaking how complex can an assignment be to be realistically tenable here?,2017-05-23T18:24:04.903,27
86,75,0,Works pretty well for warm up type stuff in an intro class. Not all that useful for labs once you get past single methods. I actually wound up writing my own because I couldn't do as much as I needed to with CodingBat.,2017-05-23T18:30:52.530,30
88,75,0,Is your tool published?  *folds hands behind back bats eyelashes innocently whistles and looks down at feet*,2017-05-23T18:35:40.780,27

100,82,1,The only reason to look into Python 2 is if you are working with some library or package that is created in it.  Otherwise I 100% agree with @Aurora001,2017-05-23T19:18:40.207,27
101,85,0,What about an API?,2017-05-23T19:40:45.257,58
102,85,0,_@thesecretmaster That'd be cool but I think they might struggle with the purpose without some understanding on front end stuff. Although I have been trying to come up with a project to use https://deckofcardsapi.com/ . There's got to be something there.,2017-05-23T19:49:47.023,30

108,93,0,Most of them knows the basic of HTML but i can't ensure it for all of them.,2017-05-23T20:46:41.290,116
109,19,4,I'm voting to close this question because ?€?is anyone out there doing this??€? invites a long list of ?€?me too?€? answers which [Stack Exchange isn't a good place for](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask). There are surely good questions to ask about how to devise a course around Processing about how to teach this and that subject using Processing about what audiences it's suitable for... but this question isn't it.,2017-05-23T20:59:22.753,124
110,43,9,You've shown tail-recursion on a problem of the same size at each function invocation and have thus merely reformulated a `do {...} until` block. This doesn't demonstrate the general power of recursion. To keep with your example I prefer a formulation like this:  `function revise(essay) {     if essay.scale > sentence {         foreach s in essay.subsections {             revise(s);         }     }     do {         read(essay);         get_feedback_on(essay);         apply_changes_to(essay);     } until essay.complete? }`,2017-05-23T21:08:31.730,62
111,40,1,I made my wording a little more like what I would actually say. Hopefully clearer :),2017-05-23T21:22:51.850,27
112,59,0,I think there are two questions here: one about the appeal for adult students (undergrads) and one for kids. Since the current answers don't focus on kids I would recommend focusing the question on adults.,2017-05-23T21:28:05.900,124
113,32,4,?€?they almost certainly won't be writing much unless they go into fields like embedded development OS development etc.?€? ?€? or even if they do. I am an embedded OS developer and I write maybe a handful of lines of assembly a year. In a busy year.,2017-05-23T21:33:32.617,124
114,96,0,Agree about CS-APA and FRQs. We do a bunch of those in class. But they're graded very lightly on syntax. Ex: = and == can be used interchangeably. Braces can generally be omitted if the intent can be determined by indention.,2017-05-23T21:36:55.597,30
115,82,0,at this time web mining libraries like pattern (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pattern) still stick with python2. Their py3 version still at testing stage,2017-05-23T23:48:33.903,133
118,19,1,This is a new site and this is the basis for useful discussion.  We need to get some of those started.,2017-05-24T00:34:01.937,21
121,96,2,As a fellow APCS-A teacher I have students keep a written notebook. In this they hand-write sample code as concepts are covered in class. I grade their notebooks every week by walking around the class with a checklist while they are working on their Friday coding project. Super fast and easy to do and it is very evident who is not progressing or who is just sloppy. I think the key to this is frequent regular formal checking with a consequence (notebooks are 5% of their final grade).,2017-05-24T04:01:10.357,136
122,106,4,I see that people are voting to close but I'm not sure why - are they actually suggesting that there are not pedagogic implications of language choice that are not purely subjective?  Surely Java is a better language to begin teaching Object Oriented Programming than C.  Different languages have different features and these choices have real educational implications.,2017-05-24T04:07:44.200,27
123,72,0,[Harvard's use of Github](https://github.com/blog/2322-how-cs50-at-harvard-uses-github-to-teach-computer-science) for CS50 is worth investigating.,2017-05-24T05:07:12.617,44
125,106,1,This seems like Good Subjective. I had a similar struggle this year choosing between PHP and Python for a particular unit. Based on the context such a question would certainly have objectivity and research to support one appoach over the other.,2017-05-24T05:36:02.223,76
126,96,1,_@Kapai Thanks for sharing your practice. I really like that idea for next year.,2017-05-24T05:37:21.243,76

129,113,0,What level is this? Are the students familiar with more abstract structures?,2017-05-24T06:53:11.873,111
130,113,0,_@wythagoras their level is the most basic `java`. By that I mean only `Scanner` and the simplest of things. I will update the question to add this information.,2017-05-24T06:54:19.963,150
131,117,2,So effectively going in reverse: teaching `html` structure and then showing that it is actually a particular case of a more abstract structure which is `xml`? *This suggestion actually makes the lesson plan flow better so thanks for that*,2017-05-24T07:05:20.457,150
132,117,2,_@ItamarGreen Yes that is what I suggest. In fact I think that this is important in most CS: use examples as much as possible and if possible use examples students are already familiar with.,2017-05-24T07:10:02.453,111
135,112,2,I made a slight change to the question. Yes the languages are different regardless of context but as with another thread there may be pedagogical reasons to differentiate between languages reasons that are unique to a classroom. I also want to stray from opinion-based questions so the differences for the classroom seemed a more answerable question. See this thread and comments: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/106/scheme-vs-haskell-for-introducing-functional-programming,2017-05-24T07:25:57.840,76
136,112,1,One more thought...I started a thread on meta that speaks to a broader issue your comment brings up. Thanks @Keelan for addressing it and helping to spur on the conversation as it will help all of us give this site an identity over the coming days and weeks. https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/24/language-a-v-language-b-v-language-c,2017-05-24T07:39:57.973,76
137,18,0,I would strongly advise against locking students to a vendor off the bat. Notice I'm not implying students are CS students. You can teach CS to other engineering students for instance. My Mechanical Engineering friends had some programming and algorithms courses where they did algorithms is pseudo code on paper and also some exercises and projects in Visual Basic.,2017-05-24T07:45:27.693,28
138,11,0,You say the ability to compile is important. But why? As someone learning how programming works the different programming paradigms etc why is it important that I deal with compiling code? An interpreted language seems much more practical. I hated when I had to spend so much time fixing my Eclipse setup to make it build my Java project so I could focus on the task at hand.,2017-05-24T07:48:41.733,28

143,19,3,No this is [not a discussion site](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) it's a [question and answer site](/tour). We do *not* need overly broad questions to get started in fact they're a bad idea because they start the site with poor content that is inferior to other more established resources. The ideal way to start the site is with *focused* *expert* questions.,2017-05-24T08:40:51.833,124

145,121,2,So if I understand correctly you are not struggling with CSS but with teaching design itself? The two can be - sort of - separate.,2017-05-24T10:26:07.753,51
146,121,0,You're asking three different questions: How can I teach creativity? How can I teach design? How can I teach CSS? I currently thing this should be closed as too broad until it gets narrowed down.,2017-05-24T10:30:30.377,58
147,118,0,TBH I don't know what monads are.  I personally learned FP using SML decades ago but utilization is so low today... there are many fewer resources around so I chose to steer clear.

148,11,1,I was being super informal with the word compile and casting a large umbrella to indicate both which is not technically correct. Plus the whole statement was stronger without it so I removed the word.,2017-05-24T10:35:15.850,27
149,93,1,I agree with @Keelan and also this is a pretty broad question: When+How should I introduce web development? I'd try and narrow it down if I were you.,2017-05-24T10:41:20.717,58
150,83,0,How would I handle the case when there are no flaws in the code? You can't assign points for flaws that don't exist. So you'd have to require the students to explain why there is no flaw?,2017-05-24T11:10:15.097,69

158,83,0,Explain or defend yes. Then the project becomes how did you prove there are now flaws. You could also give the class a program with known flaws and have them attack that.,2017-05-24T12:07:01.223,35

164,130,2,How large are the programs that are being written? If they were 5-10 lines I can understand why he'd say that and giving a longer task to complete might help to make him realise the value of indentation.

179,118,1,_@Choirbean You may want to try OCaml then. There are lots of resources (like Real World OCaml etc) and a quite large community for it. As for SML it hasn't died but all available resources (e.g. Ullman) are quite dated.,2017-05-24T17:26:47.410,130
181,63,1,Basic knowledge of data structures is necessary as a few synchronization mechanisms use queues. You could potentially include it in a data structures course IMO. pthreads could be confusing at this level though. C++11 threads would be a better choice.,2017-05-24T17:29:58.800,130
183,142,0,Algorithms as systematic replicable automatable ways to solve problems?,2017-05-24T17:54:31.463,44
184,142,0,Yes. Like a machine learning algorithm might be keep trying random stuff till you get a better result... Not just stuff that you find on github if you need to copy it (or have to memorise for an exam).,2017-05-24T18:00:08.153,41
185,96,1,For my HS work we had a very rigorous; Flowchart -> Hand Code -> Enter into IDE & Debug to force us to work on thinking through the problem attempting it by hand and then fixing what we b0rked.,2017-05-24T18:53:13.170,35
186,118,2,In terms of SML there is a MOOC on Coursera Programming Languages Part A. I completed the course for my first dive into functional programming and really enjoyed it. The other two parts focus on Racket and Ruby respectively. There are great videos lecture notes exercises etc. Plus it taught me Emacs which I found valuable. Here's a link: http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/17sp/,2017-05-24T21:09:38.647,76
200,32,2,The point would likely not be to train students how to write applications in assembly language but more so that they learn enough about (near 1-to-1) machine code to better understand how a CPU/processor actually carries out the real work.,2017-05-24T22:37:48.820,59
201,148,1,I use a similar analogy for variables. Could you elaborate a bit on how you might use boxes to model inheritance instance methods class methods and properties? I think there's more here that could be expanded upon.,2017-05-24T23:50:36.540,76
202,121,0,Consider phrasing the question so that it leads to researched longer answers. Is there a way to...? is less open-ended then What are the techniques for...? The latter seems to me to lead to more focused experienced-based answers.,2017-05-24T23:55:35.287,76
203,130,0,_@Nat I'm going to have to steal your April 1st idea. That's great.,2017-05-25T01:30:51.630,30
204,48,0,_@Adam I'm not suggesting that IDEs be blocked entirely but that as a teacher you use a simpler code editor. Students can use what they prefer because everyone has different editor preferences but set the example of keeping it simple.,2017-05-25T02:09:43.347,58
205,147,0,The two best _objects_ to use are vehicles and computers. The benefit to both is that they commonly have inner workings (private methods and data) that are not exposed by the interface. The vehicle class can start with a bicycle (no motor) and move on to cars/trucks and just in case wheels gets thought of as a base class attribute what about the helicopter? The benefit of the computer as a sample object is that it should already be in the classroom and easily compared to the smart phone and tablets that students are likely to have available as well.,2017-05-25T03:00:34.053,104
206,156,1,Linking the words to an audio recording of each see [e.g.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/13589755/#editor),2017-05-25T09:43:37.167,44
207,120,3,I have had some experience teaching normalization to undergrad business students. It was a fairly painful process and I think it would be a lot to ask a non-technical audience to do it correctly in just three days (assuming you are teaching the practical Access skills alongside?) Is the goal to enable them to do all of this entirely on their own? I would think that enabling them to get to a level where they could comprehend and use a solution delivered by someone else might be more achievable but maybe not deliver business goals. Either way the exact goal will inform the answer here.,2017-05-25T09:57:54.320,188
209,120,0,_@Diarmuid??Muirgheasa Thank you you are right. My only goal is to help them understand the basic concept of a relational database better. To help them get a feel for it. The way I see it NF1 through a few examples helps achieve this. I'll update my answer so this is clearer.,2017-05-25T10:55:51.130,51
211,120,0,Maybe this question is too specific for this site? Maybe not a lot of people are foolish enough to try and teach database basics to non IT adults in 2-3 days? :),2017-05-25T11:02:54.653,51
212,120,0,Not sure you can cover the tradeoffs in normalization alone in 2 to 3 days. Combined with these are the database skills you need it feels like too much. What about doing it as two classes?,2017-05-25T11:40:01.357,35
213,143,0,No points for solving the problem?,2017-05-25T11:41:20.393,35
214,83,0,_@Keelan I disagree.  For example in a C class code that could have buffer overflows should lose points.,2017-05-25T11:41:27.863,183
216,161,3,For those that do not know Phrogram could you clarify what you mean what you mean by 'language oddities and paradoxes' and how Phrogram avoided them? Additionally since the list of requirements appears to be non-exhaustive can you sketch the intended usage and learning goals for the students which the language you seek should help achieve?,2017-05-25T11:50:50.447,154
217,161,0,I'm curious where C# and Java fail the requirements you listed. I don't necessarily disagree with you. But they seem to hit all of your bullet points with the exception of indention maybe. Your requirements seem more like a list of things for the IDE instead of the language.,2017-05-25T11:55:10.710,30
218,161,1,For someone who doesn't know Phrogram this is not at all clear very broad and very opinion based.,2017-05-25T11:57:50.353,58
219,161,0,OK I'll rework the question after lunch... Give me an hour.,2017-05-25T12:10:44.667,51
220,161,0,_@RyanNutt I have reworked the question a bit. C# and JAVA might work but I don't know of an IDE that is not way too complicated for a beginner. Something that you just double click and start coding then hit run.,2017-05-25T12:46:06.680,51
221,161,0,_@Discretelizard You are right sorry. I'll have a hard time explaining what's exactly wrong with C# because I've gotten used to it too much. It has a few odd structures like the iconic x++ for incrementing the type-first variable declaration or the odd syntax for the for loop. Granted you will get used to it in a few days but I think beginners need something closer to human language and closer to pseudocode-like logical statements.,2017-05-25T12:54:47.503,51
222,143,0,Rarely and only 1/2 to 1 point. The goal (if I can extrapolate) seems to be to award points for properly executed components and build up the full score that way.,2017-05-25T13:02:04.497,27
223,165,0,Thank you! Very nice looks really good! I'll try it in the evening. Just what I was looking for. I'll leave the question open though in the hopes of getting some more similarly good ideas.,2017-05-25T13:12:37.557,51
224,144,2,I don't think this is a _relevant_ answer here. It might fit in retrocomputing but I get twitchy every time people use 1970's tech (or earlier) to justify a modern education topic.,2017-05-25T13:27:22.560,41
225,165,0,Is it even possible to write scratch without the IDE? I've never heard of that happening.,2017-05-25T13:33:29.710,58
226,153,1,My students learn both a command line environment (javac/java) and they use an IDE (usually drJava although some migrate to NetBeans IntelliJ or Eclipse).  I don't know what you lose using the command line interface.,2017-05-25T14:23:39.923,21
227,154,0,I think there are probably *hundreds* of games that would use lists; I'm not sure whether it's practical to fit these options in the Stack Exchange format. Do you have any specific game types in mind or additional constraints to limit the answer set a bit?,2017-05-25T14:43:17.517,2
228,154,0,_@Aurora0001 Well i specifically ask for relatively easy games. I can try and narrow it down a bit more.,2017-05-25T14:48:46.963,166
229,154,0,I'm sure you can imagine there are hundreds of ideas that could meet that criteria; perhaps including the tasks that you've set so far would help so that answers can get a clearer picture of what might be useful to you rather than a big list of *every* game that could possibly use a list which probably won't help you so much.,2017-05-25T14:51:17.450,2
230,32,1,_@hotpaw2 Ah right sorry about that; it appears I've missed the point a little bit. I think the answer would depend on what language you plan to teach?€?a Python class probably wouldn't need an awareness of assembly just yet but a C/C++ class might find it helpful. I'll revise my answer a little if you edit with that info in the question.,2017-05-25T14:55:00.347,2
231,165,0,_@thesecretmaster There have been some user-contributed alternate players for Scratch. Examples: [Phosphorus](https://phosphorus.github.io/) [official HTML5 player](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-html5) [SB2.JS](https://code.google.com/p/sb2-js/). And even some alternate IDEs: [M30w](https://sourceforge.net/projects/m30w/) (text based) [Pixie](http://nathan.github.io/pixie/) (in JS).,2017-05-25T15:01:56.207,166
232,149,1,I use this one too. It goes Thing > Living Thing > Animal > Mammal > Human > Student > High School Student > Computer Science Student > 3rd Period Computer Science Student. We add in properties and methods at each level when we talk about inheritance.,2017-05-25T15:04:21.117,30
233,65,1,In my opinion the two main disadvantages of the Raspberry Pi are the cost (besides the Pi you'll also need displays and keyboard+mouse) and the complexity of running a full Linux system.  Learning how to use a new operating system by itself can already be a barrier to entry and it can be time-consuming to troubleshoot and fix the OS if something goes wrong.  An Arduino can in that respect can be easier as flashing a new program is a fresh start.  Additionally there is plenty of room for a variety of skill levels as there are tools which allow block-based programming of the Arduino too.,2017-05-25T15:13:34.387,200
234,171,5,+1 because Python is good but i disagree with saying Scratch isn't a *real* language. It teaches the basic programming concepts without making you worry about annoying things like syntax. You can still make cool projects in Scratch that use actual algorithms.,2017-05-25T15:37:58.647,166
235,165,0,I guess Scratch is a very great child-focused option. Remember it has an online option very useful.,2017-05-25T15:41:03.053,6
236,171,1,_@Scimonster You're right I think 'real' doesn't reflect what I was trying to get at?€?a general purpose language that can be used for nearly anything whereas Scratch is more limited in its uses (although still has a very important place in education). In Scratch you can make games and animations but Python allows you to make applications games websites command line programs?€?nearly anything. That was what I meant when I said *real* although re-reading it it did sound a bit 'snobby' so I've changed that.,2017-05-25T15:44:51.780,2
237,154,0,We've started a discussion about this question on meta [here](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/40/questions-simply-seeking-ideas).,2017-05-25T15:52:37.707,27
240,161,0,scratch python eiffel (depending on where they are). Eiffel is for learning OO so around A-level. Scratch is for  beginners. Definitely Eiffel before C???  Java or C++.,2017-05-25T17:24:26.337,204
244,130,0,_@nat When I was a software engineer I had a colleague that argued against good-names (for methods and variables). I could not convince him so issued a new rule all names should be as short as possible (a b c ?€? z aa ab ?€?). At this point he agreed to at least give it a go.,2017-05-25T17:38:20.770,204
245,2,0,I have been considering Unit test tools (this is a class of tool not a specific tool) so could be applied to other languages). I have just started teaching so not tried yet. For Java I think JUnit is a popular one.,2017-05-25T17:51:37.593,204
246,171,2,+1 for mentioning ```turtle```. The concept is simple but it seems very effective to get interesting visual output in 'non-visual' language.,2017-05-25T18:15:00.587,154
247,174,1,Algorithms do not have a complexity or membership in P or NP. The _problems_ that may be solved by various different algorithms can be in P or NP however.,2017-05-25T18:23:24.770,154
249,65,0,Fair points. As for the cost and I know this is not universal my school has quite a few old displays/keyboard/mice. Without older peripherals to use then the cost issue does arise. Additionally the HDMI-VGA connection with older displays is not without its issues. The command-line environment aside I think the latest PIXEL desktop goes a long way to making the OS more beginner-friendly. Out of curiosity what are the block-based tools for Arduino? I always used the now-defunct codebender on a Chromebook so I haven't seen a non-text based IDE.,2017-05-25T19:13:33.167,76
250,174,0,More specifically only *decision problems* can be in P or NP.,2017-05-25T19:14:59.427,130
253,153,0,When I was in HS we used IDEs. One teacher used NetBeans and I believe the other used Eclipse. Although students might have some trouble dealing with CLI environments when they eventually continue learning programming in college it does remove a lot of hassle and allow students to focus on programming not setting up the environment (can be a headache especially if you're using Windows).,2017-05-25T19:18:58.263,130
254,180,1,I was recently contemplating cross curricular computing and what this should be: not using a word processor in English and creating a power point for history. But instead History teaching the history of computing; English teaching the poetry ?€?there is no place like `::1`?€? (also `127.0.0.1` and `~`);  Geography considering computing culture moor's law and the fact that the internet is full (the internet is dead long live IPv4);,2017-05-25T19:21:27.227,204
255,144,2,7 seg can do a-f,2017-05-25T19:26:25.310,204
256,137,0,I suspect it is easier to teach octal before hexadecimal. Then explain that it is not used **much** these days but is still used.,2017-05-25T19:27:40.520,204
257,185,1,prolog (or languages like it) are use in real world applications they can be used for anything that imperative languages are used for however declarative languages are not always the best language for the job. Although prolog is described as logical it is also declarative. There are other ways to teach logic.,2017-05-25T19:36:31.203,204
259,185,0,Not really. There are resources for doing logic programming in functional languages like Racket. I'll post the links when I find them.,2017-05-25T21:30:54.007,130
260,7,0,The question can help to give some ideas about what the 'no-programming language' approach looks like: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/29830/how-can-i-teach-computer-science-without-using-computers .,2017-05-25T22:00:11.477,154
261,7,1,I second that this question should distinguish between basic programming or a basic algorithms as both the audience and the learning goals often differ: does the student want to design algorithms or does the student want to do more programming? (Although the tasks are related they are quite different still),2017-05-25T22:08:33.867,154
262,185,1,Do you want to teach about logic in general or about [logical programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) in particular?,2017-05-25T22:19:30.683,154
264,48,1,I disagree. One can write for example ruby professionally (e.g. the creator of Ruby on Rails) and still use a simple editor with syntax hilighting (TextMate). It _is_ about preferance because the same code can be written with `nano` as can be written with RubyMine. A carpenter can't cut the wood the same with their hands as they can we a saw. It could be like the difference between a hand saw and a motorized saw. Some people like `nano` some people like RubyMine some people like somthing else. It's all a matter of preference.,2017-05-25T23:23:31.433,58
265,181,2,That's a great article to keep in mind - thanks for sharing it. Could you elaborate a bit as to how it connects to the specific question being asked above?,2017-05-25T23:26:37.683,76
266,185,1,Have you heard of the course Nand2Tetris? It's not logical programming per se but the first three chapters are all logic-focused using HDL (Hardware Description Language). If your goal is logical concepts in general using programming I will elaborate below. It might be helpful to rephrase your question as a few of us are on the fence here as to what you might be seeking.,2017-05-25T23:40:21.087,76
267,48,1,Additionally as a carpenter myself I can say that on some projects I'd use my power tools and on others I'd use my hand tools. It depends on various characteristics of the task. Same thing with programming. When I work with ruby I use a text editor. When I write code for android I use Android Studio. It depends on the demands of the job.,2017-05-25T23:50:42.147,58
271,113,2,Do you teach the DOM? I found that the tree-like structure and the accompanying visualization helped illustrate how HTML works.,2017-05-26T00:52:56.230,76
273,180,2,Isn't this purely opinion?  Without knowing the goals of the course it is impossible to guess.,2017-05-26T02:13:42.820,27
274,191,0,While I love teaching front end web stuff I don't think that the OP is asking about that. The problem is that HTML+CSS are not real languages in that they cannot do logic accept user input on their own etc.,2017-05-26T02:34:03.473,58
275,191,1,_@thesecretmaster Correct. The point is that it is a natural introduction into a real world. And besides CSS does drive toward an object oriented mindset. And javascript has plenty of logics. The order is very important.,2017-05-26T02:37:13.060,182
276,191,0,It also doesn't match what the OP asks for. HTML+CSS are not programming languages they are markup languages. And if you want to talk about JS although it is a programming language it is not free of language oddities and paradoxes as the OP requests.,2017-05-26T02:41:26.137,58
277,191,0,_@thesecretmaster Let's agree do disagree. HTML+CSS _is_ a programming language as much as Make and Prolog are. All of them transform a set of rules to the visible result. Who cares that they are not functional or imperative or whatever but descriptive.,2017-05-26T02:53:16.740,182
278,180,0,I think that the question is attempting to ask about if history should be part of the course goals. I'd prefer to say that this is too broad but then again Should I talk about history? is 90% of the time Yes but because of the why aspect of the question it may still be too broad.,2017-05-26T03:03:36.300,58
282,171,0,Check out Guido van Rossum's (Python's creator and 'benevolent dictator for life') paper on [computer programming for everyone[(http://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/) from 1999.,2017-05-26T08:02:32.743,44

285,120,2,_@vacip I think you can definitely explain why we normalize in a short period of time - demonstrate the various anomalies that result if we don't. That's reasonably intuitive with good examples I think. You could also have a good discussion of cardinality and teach them the mechanics of Access as well. I'll have a think about a more complete answer to post below.,2017-05-26T08:18:31.383,188
286,113,0,_@Peter I didn't think about showing it like that. Thanks,2017-05-26T11:08:29.487,150
287,184,0,Oh. wow CLIs number 2 is very interesting. I'll remember that for when I need to explain it. Thanks,2017-05-26T11:09:44.287,150
289,180,0,IMO this really only becomes relevant as you face going out into the workforce to maintain legacy code. Understanding that the first databases weren't relational is only useful when you're looking at code that's a holdover/hangover from those days.,2017-05-26T12:27:33.507,65
290,130,8,One virtue of Python is that it requires proper indentation.  The students quickly see the benefit of good formatting habits.  These habits stick when they program in other languages.,2017-05-26T12:58:39.507,21
291,143,1,On #6 they don't use 1/2 point any more. They're all full points. So if I was creating a rubric from scratch I would only use whole points.,2017-05-26T13:02:10.300,30
293,185,0,Thanks for the comments. I'll try to improve the question for clarity.,2017-05-26T15:07:51.227,116
294,203,4,I'm not sure that elderly is enough information here.  Is this a recreational course at a retirement facility?  Are these just regular adults signing up for coursework in order to learn a skill?,2017-05-26T15:14:14.633,27
295,126,0,Downvote with no comment? The OP asked for an _analogy_. IMO the Cat in the Hat's Little Cats are a perfect analogy.,2017-05-26T15:24:07.887,65
296,191,1,_@user58697 I concur. I think the learning comes from students manipulating and creating something that they are already familiar. Being able to go home and think they have come part of the way in understanding a real-world concept.,2017-05-26T15:26:29.417,146
297,203,2,Do you have the scope to break the course into optional modules or structure it more as a drop-in (with a published schedule)?,2017-05-26T15:29:09.997,41
298,65,1,There are Scratch plugins for interfacing with Arduino and mod called S4A.  There is also library called [BlocklyDuino](https://github.com/BlocklyDuino/BlocklyDuino) which is a port of Blockly to generate code for the Arduino.  One project which uses it is [iForge](https://www.genlrn.com/iForge/).  I'm also using a 3rd party Arduino called the LightBlue Bean which can be programmed over bluetooth from an iPad.  It can be programmed with blocks in the iPad apps [Tickle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1063639403?mt=8) and [Bean Forge](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1226549950?mt=8).,2017-05-26T15:41:37.093,200

301,161,2,Perhaps of interest: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_educational_programming_languages,2017-05-26T16:27:20.743,111
302,203,0,There is a discussion about this thread [here](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/47/can-we-replace-the-elderly-tag),2017-05-26T17:54:36.990,27
303,207,3,Projecteuler is also an excellent site for high-fliers.,2017-05-26T18:15:31.007,27
304,207,0,_@Choirbean - That's on my list too. That's the go to site for 2 or 3 students every year. Also a really good source for lab ideas.,2017-05-26T18:20:07.067,30
305,203,0,I don't think that one-size-fits-all approach is good. State the goals of the class beforehand.,2017-05-26T19:03:23.497,182
306,207,2,_@Choirbean I do not recommend ProjectEuler. It is much more about math than programming.,2017-05-26T19:08:28.450,182
307,207,2,While it's true that the questions are very mathy I've gotten a lot of student enthusiasm from some of them.  I have a few go-to exercises (like the dynamic programming exercise about brick line intersections) that have gone very well,2017-05-26T19:32:25.377,27
308,81,0,This looks so much nicer now that math notation is enabled :),2017-05-26T19:45:59.150,27
309,180,0,Which curriculum? You don't teach the same thing to future programmers and to future accountants.,2017-05-26T19:57:53.810,124
310,81,0,_@Choirbean Yeah. I expected that the math notation would be enabled soon enough so I already used it when writing the answer. This answer is also a good one to show it is needed here I think.,2017-05-26T20:12:20.000,111
311,207,3,Why would it being mathy mean it's not good for a CompSci class? The ones that do the Euler problems like them a lot and they wind up writing some impressive code to solve the problems.,2017-05-26T21:28:31.397,30
312,19,0,I have a vested interest in this topic and would love for substantive experiential responses so I suggested an edit that might address the issue of it being too broad.,2017-05-27T01:53:58.030,76
313,185,0,_@James I made a suggestion. See if it is in the spirit of what you are seeking.,2017-05-27T02:02:16.327,76
314,212,2,Possible duplicate of [Should assembly language be taught in an introductory course (or soon after)?](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/27/should-assembly-language-be-taught-in-an-introductory-course-or-soon-after),2017-05-27T07:42:20.753,76
316,212,2,Disagree. That question is specifically asking if assembly should be taught at all. In today's world C is considered low level.,2017-05-27T07:44:40.343,215
317,212,1,Fair enough. I see the distinction you are attempting to draw.,2017-05-27T07:55:17.143,76
319,213,11,The index of an array is a measure of the distance from the start. (not what you asked for but another way to explain it).,2017-05-27T10:12:05.053,204
320,217,2,Similarly [Asimov's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics#Zeroth_Law_added) start from zero (although chronologically the zeroth law was added later).,2017-05-27T10:18:30.007,2
321,211,2,Hard to remember back this far but the malloc example is useful even if you skip over the work underneath. It exposes the machinery inside the black box just enough.,2017-05-27T10:19:00.950,41
324,213,2,There are a few here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering,2017-05-27T10:32:38.070,204
325,211,2,Is this an AP CS class or something where you have more free reign in the curriculum?  And what is the general language of the course?,2017-05-27T10:34:51.010,27
326,214,8,I thing this answer is exactly it. Just like a ruler and @Choirbean's string answer: we measure from 0 but (usually) count from 1. In arrays we are giving the distance a measure.,2017-05-27T11:22:57.693,204
327,212,2,I prefer to teach high level first and thing that we are usually not high enough. However I have seen one teacher start with very low-level and hardware. I fully agree with what this teacher did. I would say very high or very low not in-between. Also do not try to follow the course of history the history of computing is important but this should not dictate the order of learning.,2017-05-27T11:28:56.810,204
330,228,0,It's really broad as it is but to try and narrow it you could specify what you want out of a language. You've said Name a new language I can teach. You should make it more What is a language that will help kids with xyz,2017-05-27T12:11:40.787,58
332,185,1,This talk about real world applications really becomes annoying. I fail to see how it pertains to your question.,2017-05-27T12:27:19.237,160
333,132,1,number four is in a way inter-student community moderation of code.,2017-05-27T12:41:06.300,150
335,228,2,Newer is not always better.,2017-05-27T14:46:29.607,160
336,137,2,Could you please tell: what is the subject of the whole lesson? I'm trying to guess the amount of time devoted to the octal system and its place in the general context of the lesson. Because per my opinion learning explicitly octal for those who already have experience with binary and hexadecimal is really unneeded ?€? octal is used *relatively* rare and a student having experience with other 2???-base systems would catch it on-the-fly when he meets it in real life. I'd rather ensure that they know two topics: generic conversion and m-base???m???-base conversion (especially for m=2).,2017-05-27T14:52:46.913,216
337,221,0,Personally the infamous error I would get when learning C was SEGFAULT :),2017-05-27T16:17:35.650,215
338,221,0,Lol yes thank you!!  Slip of the tongue there :P Conceptually similar errors though.,2017-05-27T16:19:30.133,27
339,228,0,_@beroal my mistake. I didn't make it clear what kind of `new` I'm talking about,2017-05-27T16:22:33.087,150
340,216,0,I don't doubt that teaching a low level language is beneficial but it's more a question of which is better as a foundation to build knowledge on: low or high level,2017-05-27T16:54:41.357,215
342,216,0,_@BrDaHa I see your point. I'll add more to the answer.,2017-05-27T17:15:15.000,150
343,216,0,_@BrDaHa edited the answer.,2017-05-27T17:18:24.467,150
347,228,2,_@thesecretmaster not sure I understand the issue you're referring to. I'm not looking for any specific language. I'm trying to teach students to learn things (techniques algorithms etc.) on their own.,2017-05-27T17:39:35.447,150
348,228,0,So How can I teach my students to teach themselves? That's still a very broad question.,2017-05-27T17:41:03.280,58
350,228,0,_@thesecretmaster Oh. That's what you mean. I'll try to make it more specific.,2017-05-27T17:43:11.620,150
352,228,0,My answer might change depending on the ages and background of the students. Can you give a little more context about that?,2017-05-27T17:55:57.733,27
355,228,0,_@Choirbean fixed the issue.,2017-05-27T18:07:49.033,150
356,236,2,So you're saying I simply shouldn't try to teach them to be independent in what they learn?,2017-05-27T18:08:27.693,150
357,211,1,Yes AP CS Principles more specifically CS50 AP. The curriculum includes pointers in an optional unit but my gut says to include it regardless. We spend about a week in Scratch for general programming concepts and then focus on C for the rest of the semester before also going over basic Python the second semester.,2017-05-27T18:30:54.993,76
358,225,0,Thanks for sharing that link. I'll use to supplement this lesson should I likely go this direction next year.,2017-05-27T18:32:30.210,76
359,225,0,_@Peter Glad I could help. Because this is about AP CS Principles I guess I should add that this is from the perspective of someone who is taking the class next year.,2017-05-27T18:34:44.580,58
360,214,5,I really like the idea of thinking of the index not as a count per se but as a measurement from the origin.,2017-05-27T18:46:24.897,76
361,232,4,I didn't refer to it as complex just challenging. I don't think it is a difficult idea. Based on my experience with students in the classroom the adjustment to starting at 0 feels different and odd at first. I'm just seeking ways of making it feel more intuitive by grounding it in real-life examples hence the motivation for the other thread.,2017-05-27T18:50:37.633,76
362,222,3,I think the idea is that the first hour of the day in the 24-hour clock is 00:00. Hence what would be 12:01 am is in fact 00:01. See http://militarytimechart.com/,2017-05-27T18:55:26.083,76
363,236,0,I don't know if independence can be taught per se but exposing students to multiple languages could encourage them to seek out more unknowns,2017-05-27T19:00:38.013,215
364,236,2,Downvoters: at least explain why you're downvoting. It's not helpful without an explanation,2017-05-27T19:01:28.013,215
365,236,2,_@Itamar Green I don't think it's that so much as students may be averse to finding a new technology without seeing a project they can build with it. They can still be independent in a sense but should be compelled to be independent by virtue of some motivating factor so as to not be dismissive of that which could be challenging confusing and/or seemingly irrelevant at first glance. For example requiring students to use BeautifulSoup for webscraping in Python may lead to seeing its value more than having them find their own library to explore in Python. Too much freedom in the latter.,2017-05-27T19:03:12.460,76
366,213,5,When playing board games my six year old starts counting from zero for the square her counter is on.,2017-05-27T19:13:51.677,44
369,236,0,_@Peter I see what you mean. So you're saying that a measure of freedom is a good way to go about it?,2017-05-27T19:30:18.670,150
371,236,3,Precisely. Too much freedom can be paralyzing. Especially for newer/younger programmers freedom with helpful guidelines/boundaries/constraints is more freeing.,2017-05-27T19:35:21.167,76
374,224,5,I like this. You can get more real-life examples based on counting the DISTANCE. e.g. If you knock on the first door in an apartment block and ask where Alice lives they say 'go down 3 doors' that's like indexing into the array of apartments. And if Alice lives in the first then you don't move ie you go down 0 doors.,2017-05-27T21:26:15.200,57
375,146,3,I'm voting to close as too broad because there's no such thing as ?€?the?€? object oriented paradigm. A lot of concepts hide behind these words they're different concepts depending on who's talking and what language they treat as the one true way of doing things and different analogies will be needed for these different concepts.,2017-05-27T23:44:03.950,124
376,146,0,It is broad but I wouldn't say it's too broad. Just because there is no correct answer doesn't mean that it's too broad. There are many different ways to kill a process each with upsides and downsides but they all could be covered by one question.,2017-05-27T23:51:14.803,58
377,245,0,I see what you're saying but I'm not quite sure how pairing students would aid them in being more independent. Could you please clarify that?,2017-05-28T07:43:22.863,150
378,245,1,Its about being able to discuss ideas with someone and obtain direction. Sometimes they may have a direction without having to discuss it (but that would assume having the knowledge in the first place). Being able to discuss affirm amongst themselves they are heading in the right direction and being able to describe what they are doing aids learning.,2017-05-28T07:54:30.643,146
379,213,0,Was there a very good answer about azimov's laws of robotics here? Or did I dream it?,2017-05-28T09:05:51.413,204
380,211,0,Note: `sizeof(myarray)` gives the size of your array (if I remember correctly) in bytes. Where as `sizeof(mypointer)` gives the size of a pointer (4 or 8 depending or architecture). Also arrays can-not be passed to another routine only a pointer is passed.,2017-05-28T09:19:37.160,204
382,213,0,If you thing zero-indexing is weird (see answer below for why it is not) then consider temperature: ??F and ??C have a strange starting point ???459.67??F and ???273.15??C.,2017-05-28T10:04:56.763,204
384,248,0,I would suggest solving this with programming. I would make a neural network that would evaluate the students' answers. But I feel like that's overkill. Then again that is sometimes my style ;),2017-05-28T10:23:15.420,150
385,248,0,What language? For ruby there is a static code analyzer that checks for best practice called rubocop. Maybe there is a similar utility for the language of your choice,2017-05-28T10:27:19.800,58
386,248,0,_@thesecretmaster perhaps looking into how `rubocop` works could be insightful,2017-05-28T10:28:46.730,150
387,248,0,rubocop is a [static code analyzer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49716/what-is-static-code-analysis). It works by looking at the code without running it and evaluating for best practices etc.,2017-05-28T10:34:39.850,58
388,248,0,_@thesecretmaster More general solutions would be ideal but Python would be the language I'm most interested in evaluating.,2017-05-28T10:47:32.123,2
389,248,0,_@subscript You should post that as an answer since it seems like a good idea. Ideas on how to find an appropriate size limit would be interesting too?€?my solution may be much shorter than theirs but a longer solution might not be unreasonable necessarily.,2017-05-28T10:51:24.750,2
390,253,4,I really like your answer but I disagree with the last paragraph. You should _never_ write code for your student. You can say out loud what has to be done and why but _never_ write the code yourself.,2017-05-28T11:03:17.753,58

396,117,1,I think html head body are abstract they don't appear to do anything. Start with the tags that produce obvious output.,2017-05-28T11:59:09.177,204

398,113,0,_@richard Oh the Russian dolls analogy is one that I have never thought of. Thanks! And if you think that you or fellow educators will find this question useful I suggest adding your own answer as we need a critical mass of answers on this site.,2017-05-28T12:01:51.797,150

416,261,0,The `static` keyword was re-used in C++ for this usage to avoid introducing another keyword. How did you explain `void` `public` `main`? All of these have no good meaning in lesson1 and can only be explained about ??way through the course. In Eiffel it does not have these words there is no main there are reasonable defaults of access if you don't return a value than don't declare a return type and there is no such thing as static you don't need it (the only use for it is once methods eiffel has these. All other uses are harmful).,2017-05-28T22:39:38.903,204

421,120,1,_@richard You are right but my students want to learn MS Access not relational databases or database management. So these trainings are MS Access for Beginners.,2017-05-29T07:32:34.303,51
422,269,0,I can attest to this grading policy. As a teacher of CS50 AP I appreciate the four-axis approach as it allows me to focus on multiple elements of students' work. It works very well and Harvard provided great training on it before I adopted the curriculum.,2017-05-29T07:42:07.090,76
424,203,0,_@Choirbean. The project started as a recreational course to teach basic use of tech for adults with more than 50 years. The classes were in the university facilities. Our current problem is define a new curriculum for those how want to continue to learn tech including basic CS and programming. Some of them keep the recreational mindset but some other really want a career change and this is the challenge in curriculum definition.,2017-05-29T11:10:14.190,116

439,290,0,The Big-O idea is a great one for testing that the design is reasonable automatically. Seems like a good 'sanity check' to make sure the code is scalable which is always a good thing. Thanks for the idea!,2017-05-30T09:19:19.520,2
440,291,0,You might want to elaborate on They don't yet have the exposure to _know_ they want to become programmers and maybe add some more specifics about the course,2017-05-30T10:29:49.550,58
441,291,5,The OP states the previous course covered from turning on the computer up to email and basic use for Microsoft Office suite. At that level they haven't learned enough to know what programming is so how can they know they want to do it?,2017-05-30T10:38:06.087,104
442,290,1,I think codility does big-o dynamicaly (by running the code). I think that static analysis of big-o is hard to do and get right 100%. But static complexity analysis is also good.,2017-05-30T10:57:10.210,204
443,294,0,I love this idea.  I'm going to tinker around with it a bit and see what I can come up with.,2017-05-30T11:14:48.293,27
444,295,1,This is the first answer I've seen that took on a first *algorithms* class which is very different from a first *programming* class.,2017-05-30T12:09:04.817,27
445,295,2,All I did was read the title.,2017-05-30T12:10:43.787,104
446,32,1,The scare/intimidation factor exists to a degree. The affected students aren't scared of doing it or of programming in general rather they decide that that's too much work. Especially when dealing with modern youth in the larger countries cost-benefit analysis seems to be automatically performed at every turn and in such an analysis assembly creates the impression that the effort far out weighs the gains.,2017-05-30T12:22:27.257,104
447,48,1,_@Adam What _are_ the correct tools for the job? I had a programming position where the required tool _was_ Notepad++ installed and configured on the computer assigned to me. The same rules applied to all 45 programmers (Perl Python Ruby HTML and JavaScript) _and_ the DBA as well. The only person using anything else was the graphic artist. The correct tool is a well trained mind using the best tools available that are appropriate for the task. Maybe and IDE maybe not. Don't short-change the students by denying them exposure to the full range of options.,2017-05-30T12:33:32.670,104
448,213,7,As seen by the majority of the comments the key is to separate `index` from `count`. `index` relates to distance or movement which has zero as the beginning while `count` relates to quantity which has a (possibly) natural beginning of one. If the students have the proper level of mathematics you can also use the powers-of-10 (the first lowest digit is x*10^0.,2017-05-30T13:44:47.483,104
449,221,0,If you and your students find the `for` loop syntax odd start with the `while` loop first. (Set `x` test `x` increment `x`). Then roll it up into a single `for` loop.,2017-05-30T13:55:39.130,104
450,221,0,I'm not confused by for loops :)  But the ordering of the operations causes confusion.  Looking at `for (1 ; 2 ; 3) { 4 }` you would expect the operations to run in a similar order but they don't. Students seem to regularly get confused by this hidden ordering trap - they need to understand the ordering as (1243[243...]),2017-05-30T14:02:03.067,27
451,251,2,You have done step-1 admitting that you have a problem are powerless to fix. Step-2: Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. Step-3: Made a decision to turn your will and our lives over to the care of a higher-power. That is trust that things will go well (on average better) if you don't do it. (see http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/About-AA/The-12-Steps-of-AA for more help) ???These steps have helped me in a lot of things.,2017-05-30T14:39:44.987,204
452,282,1,Not sure I understand what you mean by concretely fits within the algorithm...,2017-05-30T14:43:35.300,150
453,235,1,I would suggest that a fourier transform would be one of the early steps. Then the rest of the code would be analysing frequencies.,2017-05-30T14:44:54.487,204
454,282,0,Good point that was rather unclear.  I edited the prompt - better now?,2017-05-30T14:57:23.413,27
455,235,0,That's exactly the sort of specificity I'm looking for. Could you flesh that out into more of an answer?,2017-05-30T14:58:11.870,27
456,282,0,So if I understand correctly you want to show them how the heuristics play their part?,2017-05-30T15:10:53.047,150
457,282,0,I want them to see where the heuristic fits into the larger decision making process and how the choice of heuristic impacts the overall performance.,2017-05-30T15:12:11.390,27
459,296,1,Upvoted. This was a very helpful answer to me.,2017-05-30T16:45:39.783,27
460,269,0,I raise my hand as well on the CS50 AP policy but I like what Choirbean said as well.  The process was very time intensive early on in the class but the programs were small so it was manageable.  Like Choirbean I found I didn't need to keep at it all that much as most students just used better style once they understood the expectations.,2017-05-30T17:55:03.623,261
464,310,1,I don't get what you mean in the 2nd paragraph. Do you mean that the variable still exist but have a value of undefined?,2017-05-31T07:32:18.070,204
465,307,1,[I have not tried this.] When showing how variables work using the box metaphor burn the box(and its content) at the end of its block. (you may want to do this out-side.),2017-05-31T07:40:17.723,204
466,307,2,Suggested better title ?€?How to illustrate scope problem when creating variables inside `if` statements.?€? ?€? with current title my first thought was ?€?Yes you can?€?.,2017-05-31T07:42:56.060,204
468,307,0,Its certainly a scope problem and there's no problem with initialising (except for only initialising in one path).,2017-05-31T09:45:49.513,41
469,295,0,_@Choirbean Sorry if the title is not obvious but it does say algorithms. I don't think you can teach algorithms without programming nor programming without algorithms unless you are really only teach a programming language which is not so useful.,2017-05-31T09:52:28.577,28
470,295,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I really liked your answer. The most important thing a CS teacher should ask themselves is What am I grading here? Do i want students to show me they understand the material or that they can succesfully build a program without the build failing?,2017-05-31T10:12:31.343,28
471,307,0,That's a much better title. Thanks @richard.,2017-05-31T10:29:16.787,27
472,295,1,_@ecc You can teach programming without using the word _algorithm_ or the concepts behind it but programs _are_ algorithms. Doing so however short changes the students in both their programming skills and their life skills. Conversely teaching algorithms does _not_ require programs or computers. A cake recipe is an algorithm as is any set of instructions to do anything. Check out [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).,2017-05-31T12:29:35.850,104
473,295,0,You are right. But given the context of this discussion saying a recipe is an algorithm is just being pedantic and you know that's not what's being talked about.,2017-05-31T12:35:00.660,28
474,295,1,That's in response to part of what you comment to Choirbean above about not teaching algorithms without programming. And sometimes recipe is used in computers anyway such as the *nix make/build process is commonly called a recipe.,2017-05-31T12:38:25.137,104
475,327,13,Just from my experience as a student computer out == doing whatever you want.,2017-06-01T02:16:22.280,58
476,310,1,I like it. I don't understand it since I have no context for Dory (never watched Finding Nemo). That's part of the problem finding context that matches what the students know.,2017-06-01T03:55:45.887,104
477,328,0,+1. That is a very good explanation. Also the spelling bee example is quite interesting.,2017-06-01T05:38:14.907,150
478,328,7,At first I thought the girl had a problem with motor control until I recognized her finger motions matching letter placement on the keyboard. If I hadn't taught touch typing I probably would have missed it completely. Still everyone has _their_ unique way of processing information. Studies or no studies.,2017-06-01T05:41:24.060,104
479,331,0,However I would make point to advise them against searching for other sites and rather ask in class if something in the site is unclear. Wouldn't it be a good thing to encourage the students to independently research? Yeah there's a potential for confusion but finding the answer you need from Google is a great skill to have.,2017-06-01T11:24:02.553,2
480,327,1,MostlyI want my students to have their computers when we are creating code. They should also keep a written notebook.,2017-06-01T11:45:23.640,21
481,327,0,And we create a whole lot of code in my classes.,2017-06-01T11:45:45.460,21
482,328,1,I think modern kids keyboard from an early age so motor memory of spelling is very common.  It's a spinal cord level phenomenon.,2017-06-01T11:47:31.807,21
483,331,1,_@Aurora0001 good point. I'm not sure what I had in mind when writing that,2017-06-01T12:44:44.390,150
484,310,0,Here's a scene from the movie that you could show for reference:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tESffhWs8l0,2017-06-01T18:24:03.600,265
486,335,1,I get the same in my computer lab using computers provided by the school. I find that consequences and praising good behaviour work.,2017-06-01T20:07:53.297,204
489,339,0,I put in an answer but the question is rather open-ended - are there some more specific lesson goals?,2017-06-01T21:29:47.487,27
490,339,0,I wasn't thinking about specific lessons. More like when you've got something planned and technology has other ideas. Guess I was thinking more generic.,2017-06-01T21:33:39.780,30
492,344,0,No doubt there's lots of good stuff there. I just used the binary dots as an example because that's the one that I have printed out and ready to go all year.,2017-06-02T01:02:07.603,30
493,344,0,_@Kapai Good answer :) You should post more around here.,2017-06-02T02:33:58.460,27
496,353,0,These kinds of questions are fine on this site but what this question is currently missing is a goal.,2017-06-02T14:34:42.230,27
499,17,0,This was a great question. I hope we hear more from you!,2017-06-02T15:34:46.397,27
500,46,0,This was a great question. I hope we hear more from you!,2017-06-02T15:37:51.393,27
501,355,1,This is potentially #1 #2 #3 #4...,2017-06-02T15:48:41.023,41
503,353,0,I've been considering creating a class in Excel for Programmers so I am interested in what this thread produces,2017-06-02T18:06:32.683,27
504,346,0,What do parents think of this assuming you're high school? I could see some flipping out about there being new content on the final even if there's no way that grades could go down. I assume there are still a few students that don't improve their grades.,2017-06-02T19:59:32.343,30
505,358,0,Could you clarify whether you want to measure how well students have learned material in a class they took together or if you're trying to measure general programming ability/aptitude?,2017-06-02T20:51:41.187,283
506,358,0,_@EllenSpertus Done.,2017-06-02T20:56:03.787,282
507,340,2,What's wrong with some students finishing in 15 minutes and others taking the full 2 hours?,2017-06-02T21:02:22.240,283
508,358,0,Why would it be any different between a 17 year old and a 30 year old? If you can code you can code.,2017-06-02T21:09:38.787,30
509,358,0,So you are looking for standards and tests?,2017-06-02T21:34:36.263,27
510,358,0,_@RyanNutt Typically these tests go in the direction of showing your knowledge in a concrete programming language administering a system and the like.,2017-06-02T23:35:15.727,282
511,358,0,_@BenI. Correct. One of the problems that we face in the implantation of CS in the school is how to evaluate in an objective way so there must be standards that we all agree on.,2017-06-02T23:36:28.917,282
512,345,1,Functional programming doesn't imply recursion. The [Bootstrap curricula](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) all use functional programming with only very limited recursion and get students through a ton of material all without the problems you rightly identify with imperative programming!,2017-06-03T00:23:34.330,290
513,11,0,I'm surprised by @BenI.'s comment. If you want your computer to say `hello world` why not just write the program `hello world`? Why do you need any of these poisons?,2017-06-03T00:44:59.773,290
514,367,2,+1 for DrRacket which I love as an environment and would love to teach with some day.,2017-06-03T01:19:29.380,76
515,345,0,I'm not sure what you mean by functional programming doesn't imply recursion - while there may be many things you can learn as a beginner in a functional paradigm before you get to recursion at some point you still have to be able to work your way through a list.,2017-06-03T01:50:00.420,27
516,363,1,I started on your paper - very interesting.  +1 for getting me thinking in a very different direction (though I still have to figure out if I can apply it to my environment),2017-06-03T01:52:19.890,27
517,11,0,Because the alternative to a language with syntax is a language that they can't actually run.,2017-06-03T01:53:44.763,27
518,368,1,I do a fair amount of activity with my class away from the computers entirely so I appreciate this perspective.  I definitely believe that we foster over-dependence on the machines.,2017-06-03T01:56:09.030,27
519,345,1,I was also being a bit flippant in my description of functional programming - my point wasn't specifically about recursion but rather that it has its own cognitive traps so it is not some easy panacea for the problems I described about imperative programming,2017-06-03T01:58:46.380,27
520,327,1,Using the computer personal or school-supplied during labs and generating code is of course fine. During the lecture to take notes can often be a different issue. A nice synergy can be found by creating lectures that are follow-along style where what's being said/done by the instructor is replicated or utilized by the students on their terminals. You access the visual learners the auditory learners _and_ the kinesthetic learners (VAK or VAKT learning styles). It also has everyone using the keyboards so no one is distracted by the typing of others.,2017-06-03T03:13:02.510,104
521,327,1,I call these *code-alongs* and I agree that they're extremely valuable!,2017-06-03T03:15:19.263,27
522,364,0,Not Sure I understand what `notional machine` means... could you explain,2017-06-03T05:29:01.023,150
523,361,1,The second one is in my opinion a very very good one.,2017-06-03T05:44:47.093,150
524,340,0,I find designing exams very difficult. Perhaps you could start with some samples from your colleagues and then modify them as you see fit. The exams I have that I'm happy about were created this way.,2017-06-03T07:00:00.993,294
525,164,1,I agree completely with the first sentence. Our intro CS course is designed around real-world labs with lab reports. In our department discussions we often cite research suggesting this is better for retention for women and minorities and has better learning outcomes for all students. If you want I can try to dig up references. In my experience we retain more women from CS 1 to CS 2 every semester. We're up to 50-50 in CS 2 (of course the university is 60% women so we have more work to do).,2017-06-03T07:07:25.640,294
526,199,0,I agree completely. This is how I do it for the final projects in intro CS at Denison. The key is to get them to start early but I find it's like pulling teeth. When I did weekly check-ins students hated it (because we still had our usual labs due). If I do it again I'll end the usual labs when the check-ins start so students don't perceive that it's double the work.,2017-06-03T07:09:35.543,294
527,201,1,For an intro CS class I have found the following tool helps students with the process of stepping through the code line by line: http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit . I show the TAs how to use it then demo it in class then make students use it in the first lab. After that it's up to students if they want to use it or not but they report that they do use it and it helps them. In intro my goal is to empower them in cs so I try to reduce time spent debugging as much as possible.,2017-06-03T07:11:48.967,294
528,377,0,Oh. The template\object explanation is quite good. So I should add a section about what happens when (compile vs runtime) with this example (after the students understand it)?,2017-06-03T09:30:28.390,150
529,377,0,_@ItamarGreen Or divert into that to help them grasp this. They will need that to grasp polymorphism.,2017-06-03T09:32:06.303,104
531,364,1,Well you could always Google for it (-:. See for instance this detailed [blog post](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/defining-what-does-it-mean-to-understand-computing/).,2017-06-03T11:42:41.007,290
532,345,1,What I mean is that there's an awful lot you can get through without recursion and you can also do a lot of recursive work through higher-order procedures that hide the recursion (as you seem to know). So it's a matter of how your curriculum is designed.,2017-06-03T11:44:28.100,290
533,345,1,And yes there are surely traps in FP too. What's a great pity is that the CS Ed literature has done so startlingly little to identify what they might be caught up in hysteria about the paradigm itself to not investigate it in any real detail. But that doesn't mean it's not a panacea (unnecessarily grand term but I'm just borrowing it from you) for _the problems described about imperative programming_; I think it is. It just moves some of the problems elsewhere.,2017-06-03T11:45:15.760,290
534,367,0,If you're at the middle-/high-school levels take a look at the [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) family of curricula. There's something in there for everyone and cut from the same cloth.,2017-06-03T11:52:59.120,290
535,164,0,References would be useful I think - This approach is a diversion from the traditional more abstract approach (making solutions before problems if you like - or add your own answer if you'd prefer.,2017-06-03T11:58:49.077,41
536,126,0,I like that this is imperfect as an analogy gives scope for discussion.,2017-06-03T13:02:58.900,41
537,373,0,I'm 100% going to use the syllabus quiz idea beginning this September. I'll still go over the material (HS after all) but I've been toying with something like this in the back of my mind and your comment just made it explicit for me. I want them to *remember* the class policies not just *hear* them. Plus my policies just get more and more idiosyncratic as time goes on.,2017-06-03T13:47:57.010,27
538,199,0,That makes a lot of sense. I can see how a structure designed to get students to get work done regularly on long-term projects would be unpopular if they're still doing other classwork. :),2017-06-03T14:02:50.220,27
539,345,1,This next September will only be my second year teaching Scheme so this is an area in which my thinking is very much evolving. Since you are both more experienced in this area and have clearly thought about it a great deal I am very curious about what you would think about [this question](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/106/scheme-vs-haskell-for-introducing-functional-programming) which I have been wrestling with.,2017-06-03T14:55:08.967,27

541,378,0,_@BenI. Yes. I forgot to write that. I'll edit to include it,2017-06-03T15:46:11.703,150

544,379,0,This is an interesting Idea to show them the is-a and has-a relationships. For some reason students sometimes get confused with those,2017-06-03T16:42:41.420,150
545,376,0,Maybe explain the benefit of writing a class once that is able to handle instances of different types of objects. Start with several types that implements a base object or interface. Write a list that needs to call the base properties or methods e.g. validating before allowing it to be added or otherwise throw an exception. Maybe the penny will drop. I'm assuming they have some grasp OOP principles.,2017-06-03T16:56:22.180,146
546,376,0,_@JTC The problem isn't with the generics of `T` it's the `Node` field of the `Node` class which is difficult for the students.,2017-06-03T17:00:52.613,150

555,382,0,_@EllenSpertus no but you can see the activity graph that shows you some useful information,2017-06-03T18:12:19.570,150
556,382,1,How do you grade the student that contributed work equal to or greater than the others yet needed few commits since their code was near-correct from the beginning? The activity graph etc. won't show much work yet they've easily earned their credits.,2017-06-03T20:12:21.077,104
557,382,0,_@GypsySpellweaver - Well GitHub shows number of additions and deletions as well as commits. So overall it can be used to see a student's contribution.,2017-06-03T20:23:10.430,150
558,110,2,Just to be clear Pyret and Racket are not in opposition. We created Pyret because we were tired of having arguments about the virtues of parenthetical syntax and decided to give people a non-parenthetical alternative that is very similar in many ways though of course having forked off we did feel free to make some changes that don't violate the spirit of the Racket tradition.  Bootstrap uses both Scheme and Pyret. Bootstrap:Algebra is and will always be in Scheme syntax. The :Reactive :Physics and (new) :DataScience curricula are all in Pyret.,2017-06-04T00:30:42.233,290
559,110,2,While I have great respect for Wadler's critique I don't treat it as gospel. It's unsurprising that it aligns with Haskell! In particular I do not view either static types or laziness as critical and they can in fact be very problematic too. As for user-defined types Racket has long since broken with Scheme on that front as does Pyret (which also has algebraic datatypes). In short there's a complex design space here.,2017-06-04T00:32:54.450,290
560,392,0,To be honest I don't consider codingbat to be a great resource for APCS A FRQs.  The FRQs are not about standalone methods they are about integrating various components together and that is not really what CodingBat does.,2017-06-04T01:07:39.247,27
561,392,0,Good to know. Would you say they have a general benefit? If so I'll revise my question.,2017-06-04T01:09:48.310,76
562,384,0,It's an interesting idea although I want to encourage collaboration and people stepping in where needed. It's an Android programming class and some things that seem like they'll be easy may turn out to be hard and vice versa.,2017-06-04T01:11:35.160,283
563,384,1,I see what you mean. If students want to revise it and all agree they can do it and not even let me know. It would only ever even come up again if the group dynamic isn't working. By the time it's gotten bad enough that someone is talking to the teacher preserving the spirit of collaboration seems like a cause already lost.,2017-06-04T01:13:48.327,27
564,392,0,Oh certainly - I usually assign a section at a time because they are grouped together as a bunch of short problems that all deal with one skill.,2017-06-04T01:26:55.317,27
565,393,2,I love this idea for groups of 4 or greater!  It seems like 3 would start to break down and groups of 2 might no longer be accurate.  What adjustment could be used for paired projects?,2017-06-04T01:36:49.350,27
566,390,0,I very much like the idea of asking them to be creative. Thanks!,2017-06-04T06:24:44.430,150
568,217,1,_@Aurora0001 I added in a bit on asimov. (also I think you should make an answer on asimov),2017-06-04T07:50:17.203,204
569,213,1,_@GypsySpellweaver love the positional (Arabic number system) ($10^n 10^2 10^1 10^0$). You should add this as an answer. I think this question will benefit from lots of answers as different pupils will grok different analogies.,2017-06-04T07:56:51.520,204
570,213,0,_@richard That's one that needs decent algebra to fathom but can fit if the class is right.,2017-06-04T08:00:23.633,104
571,396,0,This sounds a bit too general to be easy to answer. What part of this problem is really difficult or different from what you're familiar with?,2017-06-04T09:49:07.730,41
572,396,0,_@SeanHoulihane edited to add that,2017-06-04T10:41:29.890,150
573,396,0,Thanks Its a bit clearer now. Still seems a little like an X-Y problem https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem but I think it's easy enough to answer.,2017-06-04T10:49:53.893,41
574,399,0,This isn't exactly what I meant in my question... but it does give me a better idea how teaching these things could be done so thanks for that. Regarding the last paragraph: As mentors we want to guide the students and teach them in a way that would be useful for them later. Students who learn these things on their own are more than welcome but they are a minority.,2017-06-04T10:58:19.337,150
575,401,0,This answers the part of my question about indentation but it doesn't really address testing or commenting which in my experience are harder to teach.,2017-06-04T10:59:39.573,58
576,401,0,Good point I'll add more about that.,2017-06-04T10:59:59.390,150

580,340,0,_@DavidWhite I do that and overall I'm pretty happy with my final. But also always looking for ideas outside of a standard test.,2017-06-04T13:21:14.543,30
581,400,0,This question is specifically about coding style?,2017-06-04T14:46:58.963,27
584,154,0,_@Scimonster I think it would be useful to try and narrow the question based on the answers so far and the meta discussion - with the aim of re-opening.,2017-06-04T15:54:16.653,41
585,400,0,No one **needs** to follow your best practices.  They just greatly reduce the risk of certain kind of failure.,2017-06-04T16:41:28.160,59
586,400,0,Well in many ways writing clean code is needed to work effectively in a group. In a professional environment you want to have clean code because if nobody can read your code you're almost useless.,2017-06-04T16:44:57.827,58
587,406,0,If we were to use this analogy how would we deal with variables declared prior to the `if` which are accessible inside of it or instance variables?,2017-06-05T02:18:35.137,27
588,406,0,Depends on which version. For Google Drive the local computer (inside `if` has access to Google Drive (outside `if`) but Google Drive has no access to local computer. For the file system version emulate the `if` block's access with a symlink/shortcut. The file (variable) still belongs to the higher level but the inner block has been granted access (probably by reference either to the outer block's scope or to the data itself).,2017-06-05T02:24:18.653,104
589,378,1,My classes do a lot with GUI/Event-Driven programming because this is a very natural realm in which to use inheritance.,2017-06-05T13:38:54.077,21
590,400,0,In many professional environments there may be automated style checks and there will certainly be review (which may demand a consistent use of mostly arbitrary style).,2017-06-05T15:49:00.393,41

All because of some sloppy programming and some missing braces!,2017-06-05T15:54:38.243,2
592,400,0,It is school: it is all practice. So we start on smaller problems. But also you need to convince them of the value. For instance you would have a hard time convincing me of the value of **most** comments.,2017-06-05T16:06:01.020,204
594,410,0,would the language choice tag fit here?,2017-06-05T18:27:00.470,150
595,410,1,Good point added.,2017-06-05T19:19:50.440,27
596,410,0,Just curious is this all for HS students? I'm quite impressed.,2017-06-05T19:43:24.740,130
597,410,0,What would be wrong with using this RISC version of LMC http://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/RISC/ - or at least a subset thereof? What's the processor course implementation target?,2017-06-05T20:06:28.160,41
598,410,1,_@xuq01 Yes all for HS. We have an unusually advanced program for the states with 4-year CS majors in HS.,2017-06-05T20:13:18.430,27
599,410,0,_@SeanHoulihane The processor class should be building a turing complete processor that they can do *some* coding on. The assembly class will do (obviously) much more coding and zero wiring.,2017-06-05T20:17:11.043,27
600,410,0,_@BenI. Looks to me that your graduates could totally go right into graduate CS classes when they get to college. I wish I could have attended such a HS program. That being said it looks to me that MIPS is one way to go. Its calling conventions are very similar to that of x86-64 and its ISA is simple enough (just a handful of instructions).,2017-06-05T20:30:35.983,130
601,259,1,Can't agree more. Code is for people first and foremost; otherwise we should all have been coding 0s and 1s instead of Python and Scheme.,2017-06-05T20:39:56.453,130
602,372,0,I would suggest asking @ShriramKrishnamurthi as he is very likely the person most knowledgeable about Racket on this SE.,2017-06-05T20:42:37.470,130
605,410,0,Have you explored Nand2Tetris? That book/course could make for a rich year-long course on the HS level and could lead to important discussions about processor design and assembly language.,2017-06-05T23:38:50.067,76
607,201,1,You've just described all my programming classes.,2017-06-06T03:58:57.790,313
610,412,1,Not meaning to be contrary but why use a RPi for this? Couldn't you just use a Linux USB boot from a normal PC? Or even a Windows Machine / Mac? Minecraft and Python is the only thing on your list that might be more difficult to do elsewhere for free but the costs of RPis memory cards and adapters might outweigh some MC licenses. Unless you are doing some physical computing I don't see RPis being any better than any current hardware you might have.,2017-06-06T14:38:30.237,48
611,412,1,Fair question. I have a few reasons. 1) I want students to walk away with a RPi to inspire further projects after the class ends. 2) I do want to do physical computing with the GPIO pins. 3) I have keyboards/mice/monitors at my disposal so those won't be an added cost.,2017-06-06T15:16:17.317,76
612,420,0,+1 for #4. I like that idea a lot. Will definitely add that to the repertoire. Do you distribute that starter code via GitHub in advance?,2017-06-06T15:20:26.720,76
613,420,0,I haven't done that yet but I possibly have not taught algorithms large enough to make it worthwhile.  So far I have only pre-distributed code for labs.,2017-06-06T16:02:18.777,27
614,421,3,Welcome to cseducators! Could you add a little bit more context about the new coursework you are considering? It would help to make the answers you receive more targeted (and useful for future users),2017-06-06T16:04:46.383,27
615,422,1,Developer training is more likely to be focused on a specific role than any university course though?,2017-06-06T16:59:40.887,41

618,426,0,Each bag is about 16 (matchboxes) - sorry typing with a mental 3YO bouncing around!,2017-06-06T17:05:41.567,348
619,422,1,That's also true the fact that you are learning for a job might be learning for a very specific job,2017-06-06T17:09:46.323,48
620,426,1,Welcome to cseducators by the way! I'm reading through the answers you are putting up and I'm finding them very hard to understand. Sentence fragments missing context etc. I'm sure that the questions would appreciate it if you went back through and edited them a bit for clarity.,2017-06-06T17:11:20.660,27
621,428,0,So you've taught them to think in a project oriented way? Cool.,2017-06-06T17:20:24.050,150
622,428,0,I don't see the obvious 'win' connection which you're suggesting.,2017-06-06T17:26:39.540,41
623,428,1,They are planning better and so producing better working solutions. This is a win.  The win for me is they are making the decision to plan themselves rather than just jumping on a computer and starting coding.,2017-06-06T18:03:14.503,348
625,419,0,Nice link to version control.,2017-06-06T19:05:25.830,41
626,430,0,What is the age range? If it is prior to university are you at a public or a private school? Sometimes your responses to issues like these depend on the administrative context of the institution you work for.,2017-06-06T20:12:06.800,27
627,430,8,Nothing about your question seems specific to CS. Could you rewrite it?,2017-06-06T20:24:24.307,283
628,430,1,Differentiate: Look at your lesson objectives and give him more challenging work that leads to the same plus additional objectives. There is always more that they can learn even if they are at M.Sc level there is more. May be a research project. ?€? Can you edit the question to make it specific: What material? What course? What age?,2017-06-06T20:37:25.483,204
629,37,0,[TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) is another great resource in this area.,2017-06-06T20:43:33.307,372

631,343,1,Can also be good to have each team write out the code by hand and trade with another team to trace through and test. Then have the two teams get together and discuss their solutions.,2017-06-06T21:08:01.743,392
632,435,0,As in call one student to the front of the room and have them type some text that everyone can see?,2017-06-06T21:09:15.963,27
633,380,0,Could you please clarify the learning objective(s) and the assessment method that gave rise to this particular situation?,2017-06-06T21:18:57.230,372
634,380,1,I believe the learning objective should inform the approach to assessment.  So if the learning objectives are specifically related to teamwork then the use of single-blind peer assessment via systems like [SparkPLUS](http://sparkplus.com.au/factors/) can be effective. Particularly where students rate each others' collegiality work ethic ability to collaborate on particular tasks etc. Students use a rubric and justify their rating by making comments which I use to write a brief meta-review as feedback for the team.,2017-06-06T21:19:56.620,372
635,435,0,To me it's unclear what you are having the student do. Are you choosing 1 student at random and only they have to type what you are typing? Or is everyone typing but one students work is displayed?,2017-06-06T21:37:37.230,58
636,338,1,Our [ITiCSE Working Group](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3024908) discovered [more than 100 games](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Goocx7_Mop5boQsT0JlWwLoUwei0JNOcDW3lahTaaoY/edit?usp=sharing) related to topics in the ACM/IEEE computer science curricula framework.,2017-06-06T22:18:37.780,372
637,430,1,What language is your course in? That might make a huge difference for how to provide additional challenges.,2017-06-06T22:37:47.523,76
640,448,1,I really like this question but it seems like it might be a better fit on [ux.se]. While it _is_ about cs education it's also very much about designing an interface for a specific audience.,2017-06-07T00:54:12.030,58
641,448,0,Wouldn't I get better information about my specific audience here? General UX design principles are certainly important but the colors have a lot to do with programming concerns like types.,2017-06-07T01:18:12.693,435
642,448,0,I guess you're right. I still think that the people at [ux.se] might have some interesting ideas especially if you're looking for studies but you'll also get good answers here.,2017-06-07T01:23:13.000,58
643,430,2,If the situation and school policy allows it maybe the advanced student can help others as a teacher's aid. The helps the other students reduces some of your load and helps the advanced student by making them think about the subject enough to explain it to someone else.,2017-06-07T01:28:48.247,104
644,445,2,Some _very_ excellent suggestions. I really like the last option. Good chance the student is ahead of the curve because of self-directed learning and/or a true passion for the subject. Helping the student reach their own potential is much better than requiring them to drag their feet at the standard curriculum's level. Also allows for grading their work against their potential and the student can feel they've actually _earned_ the grade instead of _passed_ some required course.,2017-06-07T02:43:33.223,104
645,430,0,This question has raised another [question in meta](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/q/87/104) about site scope. Join the discussion if you like.,2017-06-07T02:49:17.590,104
650,448,3,I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's more about UX than education.,2017-06-07T05:09:53.723,76
651,452,0,I agree that it's horrible in any programming language is misleading but they don't know about functional languages and as a CS1 class its hard to appreciate side-effect free design. I fear the nuances of when recursion is a good design choice is hard to describe in CS1. (Your observation about an 'exit' statement is essentially 'you need a base case' and is something we cover and not itself answer to when is recursion good practice?). I'll revise my question to be clearer.,2017-06-07T05:24:31.787,475
652,452,0,_@GermaneDork yes. As I said you should explain the importance of good exit statements. Ones that must happen to avoid a stackoverflow,2017-06-07T05:25:50.407,150
653,451,2,I cannot express how much I like this question. I see students struggling with this.,2017-06-07T05:29:16.890,150
654,453,2,I like this teachable moment and I like reformulating the tool in their minds: an exercise in thinking more so than programming.,2017-06-07T05:35:03.457,475
655,452,0,_@GermaneDork oh. Well then I'll revise my answer for future readers,2017-06-07T05:40:14.220,150
656,432,0,This is a very good solution. In fact it helps with another students who fits the description (warned about future problems like that). Thanks!,2017-06-07T05:45:44.620,150

658,445,0,The java specifics are quite useful. I will definitely use them,2017-06-07T05:47:03.047,150
659,443,0,The main issue is that we have project guidelines. They can't be made to fit the student's choice so I am partly trying to think of a guideline that would allow him to do something on his level and yet he'd still have to meet requirements (I guess you could say: on his terms).,2017-06-07T05:49:29.493,150

661,455,0,Welcome to Computer Science Educators. Generally it is better to include the basic information in the answer than to link to something externally. The link may not last and then the answer will not help anyone. Would you please edit your answer to show how you have solved the problem of teaching induction in an intuitive and masterable fashion.,2017-06-07T06:17:45.523,104
662,448,0,I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it doesn't specifically deal with teaching computer science rather it asks about color psychology in the sense of teaching which isn't exactly in the site's scope.,2017-06-07T07:36:56.337,150
663,430,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I feel my question still needs more details but I am unsure which.,2017-06-07T07:49:17.760,150
664,430,0,Specifics always help and will make this a CSE question rather than general education. We need these students in industry don't loose them! The specifics can be exactly your scheme of work etc.,2017-06-07T09:01:34.850,41
677,462,0,Could you please clarify or add details to the questions asked?  e.g.: *My question(s): how do I get students excited about recursion? How do I better motivate studying recursion? Can I better / more naturally express those conditions under which (or those languages for which) recursion is not a poor design choice?*,2017-06-07T09:32:21.907,150
685,448,4,This is on-topic. Let's build a community here. It's related to understanding why indentation is important. I don't know of research on this but I am curious to hear others'thoughts. I am an App Inventor user and the main color I notice is the Event Handlers are purple. Other than this I don't find the colors helpful in this language.,2017-06-07T10:10:08.650,499
686,40,1,Time like this make me miss WordPerfect. If you selected reveal code it opened a small pane at the bottom and showed graphical open/close tags around bold/italic/center/etc. Shaped like a box with a point on one end or like really old wooden direction arrow street signs. Perfect for showing the tags in HTML. Could even save as HTML and match the tags 1:1.,2017-06-07T10:14:31.173,104
687,40,3,If you want to go crazy with this you can still use Word.  Make a very simple document save it as docx and rename the .docx to .zip - inside are folders of xml files one of which contains your text in an insane markup.,2017-06-07T10:17:46.720,27
688,346,0,Grades always came up (since it was a mathematical certainty as long as the exam was attempted).  I never spoke to any parents about it but I also never received any complaints.  I think I explained it clearly enough to the kids that such complaints were possibly headed off at the pass.  (Or maybe I was just lucky?),2017-06-07T10:30:54.100,27
689,408,4,(Was an answer but three separate people complained so I'll make it a comment instead because I personally find pointers to authoritative sources extremely useful.)

690,335,0,A technical solution may work as well. Most games that are enticing enough to play when they shouldn't be require Internet access. If the IT dept. can block those addresses from the APs that cover the classroom(s) or from the school's network as a whole they will be forced to use mobile data to play. The co$t of that _might_ slow them down some.,2017-06-07T11:47:06.107,104
692,451,1,I don't quite have an answer but I think that lies somewhere along the path of 'what would they be missing if you didn't need to teach recursion'.,2017-06-07T11:52:29.507,41
693,448,1,Block colors organize code in block languages. This seems on-topic to me.,2017-06-07T12:39:40.077,27
695,465,1,This answer is great but could be expanded upon to really cover and address the points in the question.,2017-06-07T12:43:22.377,150
696,465,2,I think this is suggesting that the colours are less useful than the groupings which are coloured - being an answer which supports this being CS related.,2017-06-07T13:41:02.663,41
697,466,0,I disagree with the first part. Understanding that it makes code understandable to other humans is in my opinion essential.,2017-06-07T14:30:07.503,150
698,346,0,I guess my concern would be a student ending the semester with an 88 or 89 and the parent (or student) getting upset because they weren't given an assessment of what they learned causing them to stay at a B. I certainly can see the validity of doing something like this and I really like the idea but I could see a lot of misunderstandings.,2017-06-07T14:31:08.213,30
699,460,0,I do something like this with my advanced classes. About two weeks out I give them a set of contest problems. They pick any 10 of what I give them and get 10 points a piece for the ones they solve. Works pretty well because they can skip the ones that they think are too difficult and they know exactly what score they get. Downside is they know exactly what score they get so several students will only do 3 or 4 problems because that's enough to keep an A average.,2017-06-07T14:33:45.180,30
702,382,0,_@Adam interesting. I didn't know that.,2017-06-07T16:03:52.993,150
705,469,3,Welcome to CSEducators.SE! Thanks for your first question. It seems like you are asking two questions here: one on guidelines and one on practice sites. Is that correct? If so I'd suggest splitting this into two separate questions. Also can you specify the relevant language(s)? Good coding practices and grading guidelines will most likely vary depending on the language.,2017-06-07T16:19:44.997,76
706,471,0,*This doesn't exactly answer the question.* The question was about getting students to be excited about recursion as well as other things that are specifically written in the question.,2017-06-07T16:21:41.960,150
708,473,5,Welcome to the site. Can you expand (by editing the question) on CS1 CS2: What level are you teaching at? We have people here teaching from nursery to University and the work place. From all over the world. So we do not always know what something like CS1 is. Thanks.,2017-06-07T17:22:30.517,204
709,465,0,They do help students find the blocks they're looking for. When I taught Scratch I'd get a lot of questions about where to find a specific block. Saying the purple group was usually the easiest way to explain it.,2017-06-07T17:24:26.217,30
711,145,3,This applies not only to indentation but also to issues such as naming and comments.,2017-06-07T17:42:59.260,387
712,448,1,IMO this is related to the use of color for syntax highlighting & relates to how people understand the code in front of them. I'm guessing that using colors at this stage will make the first use of an IDE feel more natural.,2017-06-07T17:53:03.713,65
714,448,4,I have created a meta-question about this question [here](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/103/questions-about-ide-features),2017-06-07T22:26:11.363,27
715,473,0,Although scrum-orientated there are some useful resources produced by [Mountain Goat Software](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile). I use these resources in the first software development practice class my undergraduate students encounter which runs in parallel with CS1.,2017-06-07T22:26:34.497,372
716,477,4,Welcome to CSEducators! I'd like to make a request:could you add a bit of detail about CS0? It's not a generally understood term or universal curriculum. You give a bit of a hint when you mention that the students have decided to be miserable but some more context would be helpful.,2017-06-07T22:36:16.090,27
717,477,1,Also what are SLOs?,2017-06-07T22:36:52.677,27
718,477,0,_@BenI. My guess is that SLO = Student Learning Outcomes.,2017-06-07T22:57:25.097,76
719,466,0,I agree it's essential but not that they have to get it right away. Most of my CS1 students only care about what they have to do to get an A (or B or C...) so the best I can do is frame it in terms of *me* (the one grading their work) being able to read it. Their experience of software development just isn't mature enough to understand the collaborative aspect.,2017-06-08T00:07:43.573,536
722,448,2,As a consequence of the meta discussion this question was discussed (and can be discussed further) [in chat.](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/60102) **Before voting to reopen please refer to the discussion in chat**,2017-06-08T02:04:15.810,58

724,22,0,I think students are _surprised_ and _fascinated_ to see the pattern of a recurrent arithmetic sequence emerge in nature (e.g. the Fibonacci sequence in the petals on a sunflower).  I don't think this taps into any deep intuition for them. So to say if you want to understand recursion just reflect on the natural processes around you that have surprising recurrent properties... may not be helpful.,2017-06-08T04:50:45.853,475

727,469,0,This question would be improved if the title was more distinct from the other ta:best-practice question (which I don't feel is really related so I won't link here). I think you're asking more about implementing style checking flows rather than 'selling' the concept of best practice.,2017-06-08T09:26:22.913,41
728,477,0,Could you please add more details as to what exactly are you asking? what is the problem you are facing out of the many things listed in your question?,2017-06-08T10:09:45.283,150
730,492,1,Could it be that at the OS level the thread protecting the shared resource should never quit? For example as long as the print spool is running each process must be allowed to complete its print before another starts but the spool is always protected by the critical section loop even if nothing is being spooled. The protective loop will only terminate when its thread is killed externally such as the OS removing that print spool.,2017-06-08T17:54:51.893,104

732,437,0,I can understand some good motivations behind making groups single-sex but it has the negative effective of calling attention to gender by making it a primary criterion.,2017-06-08T23:13:10.793,283
733,498,1,I think CSTeachingTips is more aimed at college teaching than HS teaching but in any case students might have outside jobs or responsibilities so they shouldn't be given unnecessary homework. As your question suggests the hard part is figuring out what assignments are valuable. Your high school might also have policies about the amount of homework.,2017-06-09T01:36:28.743,283
734,498,1,We do have a policy of up to 30 minutes/class/night or 45 minutes/class/night if it's AP/Honors but that's a ceiling and doesn't speak to what exactly gets assigned. Good to know about CSTeachingTips - I find following it really valuable. Case in point it inspired me to ask about homework and how best to approach it.,2017-06-09T02:02:48.890,76
735,344,0,I'm a big fan of the error detection activity especially for junior high students. For high school students I might extend the example to force the students to discover how the trick works rather than telling them. IIRC there are also extension activities in the activity itself.,2017-06-09T03:22:21.553,595
736,500,1,Using poor candidates as learning examples is a good point.,2017-06-09T04:17:10.050,104
737,500,0,Wow. This is a very useful answer. It can also be used with neural networks.,2017-06-09T04:53:52.133,150
740,493,0,I'm sure a simple example can be done as a group exercise (with a trivial hash). I'll try and develop something unless someone beats me to it.,2017-06-09T09:38:38.287,41
742,505,0,_@thesecretmaster this isn't about the value showing that there's an acceptable norm and that they should follow it,2017-06-09T11:19:26.337,150
743,505,0,Why it's important == value understandable == best practices.,2017-06-09T11:21:45.323,58
744,505,0,_@thesecretmaster still a duplicate?,2017-06-09T11:26:56.150,150
745,505,0,I think so. You reworded it but didnt change the meaning of the question.,2017-06-09T11:34:40.827,58
746,505,0,_@thesecretmaster ok fair enough.,2017-06-09T11:43:25.267,150
747,505,1,I think the 'best practices' question is very broad and there's value in having this as a separate one. There are different approaches to teaching people to use source control versus writing readable code so it's ok to have different questions.,2017-06-09T12:33:08.883,57
748,505,0,_@Rory The other question is about best practices generally including VCS commenting indentation etc.,2017-06-09T12:49:48.597,58
749,506,1,I like the approach but doubt it will work. Coding conventions allow the part of your brain that parses _what_ you're looking at to run on autopilot so you can concentrate on the _what's it doing_. But learners aren't at a level to have an autopilot yet. They're always fully concentrated on all aspects. So they won't notice the lack.,2017-06-09T12:51:05.920,65
750,505,1,_@thesecretmaster but it asks about teaching them and ensuring students continue with those best practices. Here I'm asking about ways for students to *understand* why coding conventions are necessary for writing understandable code as well as the importance of those conventions.,2017-06-09T12:52:24.840,150
751,505,2,_@thesecretmaster - exactly. I meant my statement as a vote towards not closing this one since the other question is broader. Therefore this should remain as an open question.,2017-06-09T12:52:41.210,57
752,505,2,If anything this question seems *more specific* to me as the other question is also about testing and VCS.  The previous question is possibly too broad (are we really going to avoid any further discussions about the reasoning behind readable code?),2017-06-09T12:53:48.297,27
753,505,1,This answer about indentation is good - https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/132/57,2017-06-09T12:57:17.350,57
754,505,0,_@Rory Thanks. I looked at that and it has helped me with a part of my question. It does give me a general Idea how it could be done but teaching indentation only goes so far.,2017-06-09T13:01:58.317,150
757,510,0,I could not have asked for a more thorough answer. Thanks!,2017-06-09T13:49:32.197,150
758,505,1,I don't see this question covering substantially different ground to the other two linked examples. You changed the spelling of the title but it has the same meaning. Is the answer different to 'code is for people to read'? An answer of 'bugs are easier to spot in templated code' does not match your question.,2017-06-09T14:01:51.933,41
759,505,0,_@SeanHoulihane You are quite right that the questions might be covering *similar* ground. However my question is about students gaining a deeper understanding of the conventions and why they are important. As I see it the bullets in Rory's answer address *that* very well. Would I have asked how to show them just how bad it would be if they didn't follow conventions then the questions would be much more alike.,2017-06-09T14:07:12.860,150
762,502,5,This question is truly language specific as norms are very different across different languages.  You can't avoid GOTO in BASIC or JMP in assembly languages and there exist (rather rare) occasions in Java when `break` statements can be good practice.  What language is this instruction in?,2017-06-09T14:38:34.437,27
763,502,0,_@BenI. True and for example in VisualBasic 6 error handling is done solely with GoTo statements. Still in most modern high level programming languages GoTo can - and should - be avoided. The reason I didn't name a language is I'm talking about concepts and best coding practice. (I also agree that `break` statements can actually make the code simpler but beginners first need to learn to write proper exit conditions for their loops.),2017-06-09T15:18:01.010,51
764,502,2,Could you add a language?  I'm trying to create an answer but it's nearly impossible to formulate a response without one.  The discussion in ASM is just completely different from the discussion in Java.,2017-06-09T15:23:54.050,27
766,510,0,and assure them that good names consistency and indentation will allow them to learn quicker.,2017-06-09T16:49:02.740,204
767,503,0,What language? Hungarian notation is good for assembler language (and pointers in C).,2017-06-09T16:52:13.790,204

769,512,0,Nobody should antagonize the kernel devs! Purpose should be the consideration not style although that has its place too.,2017-06-09T16:57:37.383,104
770,502,4,`break` `continue` etc. all have a place and a time. The trick is to learning when and why. I recommend showing the power as well as the danger in using them. I'm always leery when someone says All X are bad - like the guy who said he never used loops only LINQ. Time and place...,2017-06-09T17:30:48.033,35
771,211,0,I agree with @Sasha that 0-based arrays are a little strange but pointers are much much more difficult. Better to not confuse things by combining the two until both concepts are consolidated in students' minds.,2017-06-09T18:52:00.987,57
772,503,0,_@richard The first mostly. Also that question you quoted was asked an hour after mine so I can't have duplicated it.,2017-06-09T20:13:31.863,51
773,516,0,Elegant expansion of what I currently do I like it! :),2017-06-09T20:14:39.203,51
774,517,0,Are you asking whether to teach this as part of existing class(es) or as a completely separate class (Markup Languages)?,2017-06-10T00:29:27.757,605
775,517,0,Existing classes. A separate class could be fun but I don't think I could sell it as an elective against other elective options.,2017-06-10T00:31:13.303,76
776,517,0,Ah too bad one of the best elective classes I took was one that studied page description languages that included markup (e.g. SGML) and printer languages (e.g. PostScript).,2017-06-10T00:40:56.773,605
777,523,1,Welcome to cseducators!  The best question answers may point to a resource but they also distill some of the key understandings. I hope to see you around the site!,2017-06-10T00:43:12.040,27
778,517,0,You need to show it to be relevant (for the pupils) and relevant for the curriculum: Some pupils will find this very relevant/interesting if you start with what it can do. In the UK the curriculum talks about special purpose languages so would be relevant at key-stage3 (pre exam stage) but after that you have the question is it relevant to the exam.,2017-06-10T07:40:27.457,204
779,503,0,sorry if you thought I was accusing you of duplication. I was not I was asking you a question to clarify what you were asking. Which of the two meanings should we use to interpret your question?,2017-06-10T07:44:10.840,204
780,516,1,I have seen lint tools that will ban `break` `continue` and `goto`. However all the C languages need `break` for their broken `switch`/`case`.,2017-06-10T07:49:06.363,204
781,528,0,That's an especially good point about Java8 - I didn't know that that change had happened. It sounds like we're almost back to the multiple inheritance problem then.,2017-06-10T13:45:55.670,27
782,529,0,I've been considering using public code reviews but have wondered about that exact problem. That is quite an elegant solution! (I will have to go back several years given my [recent grading practices](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/130/how-to-teach-why-indentation-is-important).,2017-06-10T13:52:57.047,27
783,525,1,Good high school example and pretty rich.,2017-06-10T14:25:43.250,27
784,493,1,Block chains are not a currency thing (though are used by some). see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain they are also used in the revision control system `git` ipfs and other systems. The basics are take the hash of the parent block append the new block and create a new hash.,2017-06-10T16:03:41.980,204
785,493,0,Thanks for that - I didn't know that! But nevertheless in order to understand the technology of finance going forward it seems like [Blockchain](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-21/who-owns-blockchain-goldman-bofa-amass-patents-for-coming-wars) is [becoming](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/big-banks-plan-interbank-blockchain-platform/articleshow/56770736.cms) rather [foundational](http://www.pepperlaw.com/publications/your-next-ipo-could-be-on-the-blockchain-2016-05-19/).

787,498,1,Have you considered `flip classroom`? Flipped classroom is an instructional strategy and a type of blended learning that reverses the traditional learning environment by delivering instructional content often online outside of the classroom. It moves activities including those that may have traditionally been considered homework into the classroom. In a flipped classroom students watch online lectures collaborate in online discussions or carry out research at home and engage in concepts in the classroom with the guidance of a mentor. ?€? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom,2017-06-10T18:06:06.517,204
788,498,0,_@richard Great question. I'll clarify my question. It stands for Advanced Placement. Essentially it designates that a class is at an honors-level i.e. more advanced than a standard grade-level course.,2017-06-10T18:07:02.470,76
789,180,0,I (hopefully) made the question more objective and wonder if it can be reopened in its current form.,2017-06-11T03:31:56.070,613
790,544,1,At least in this example consider changing the class Edible to Food. It makes more sense to have the interface name a noun in this context as I see it.,2017-06-11T07:18:14.677,76
791,544,1,_@Peter I thought about it but I feared it was too much like a name I'd give an abstract class. But after more thought i think it's not as confusing as I thought. Btw it's not a class but an interface,2017-06-11T07:20:09.993,150
792,206,0,Now that we've had this conversation you might be able to glean some ideas from here as well: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/430/problematic-student-at-a-very-high-level,2017-06-11T07:48:09.357,76
793,547,0,The context of friendship sounds potentially useful.,2017-06-11T08:27:49.633,150
794,549,0,I like the analogy but I'm not sure it'll make it clear that `implements` I'd binding,2017-06-11T08:59:43.420,150
795,549,0,First day of the term use a survey with the stated rules that any open blanks on the survey is an error: no credit.,2017-06-11T09:01:11.090,104
796,549,0,So then I could say that the student's answers implements `SurveyAnswer` and as such should contain answers for each question and of the fitting type?,2017-06-11T09:03:27.560,150
797,549,0,I don't even like the analogy. I believe this is no more of a contract than using strong types (or a rigorous formatting styles) which permits automated checking for consistency. My view (with zero experience of java) is that an interface definition permits the compiler to tell you when you've made incorrect assumptions. There is no mutually beneficial trade as implied by a true contract.,2017-06-11T09:20:49.367,41
798,25,1,This answer would be improved if it had more of a synopsys of the linked material. Reading it without following the links (or if the links die) there is not a lot to go in.,2017-06-11T09:24:42.813,41
799,548,0,I feel this question is quite broad. Could you specify which CS concepts you'd want to illustrate in such a way?,2017-06-11T09:25:42.693,150
800,548,0,It feels rather broad but there is some focus (i.e. I have exactly these 2 devices - what can I teach with them).  More background on your other physical computing context would help.,2017-06-11T10:41:47.750,41
801,527,1,You've asked 2 questions. One is mapping a problem to the most appropriate loop form (which is simple and definitive) the other is how to teach this... I'd suggest changing the title if you meant the former (and that I think is a clearer question to ask hoping for some teaching input as a side-product),2017-06-11T12:28:42.490,41
802,549,0,_@SeanHoulihane that is not entirely true. There might not be any mutually beneficial trade but it's not a definition that allows the compiler to know of incorrect assumptions either. It is a binding construct. But the idea of a contract is useful. I am trying to explain that to the students.,2017-06-11T13:18:47.070,150
803,549,0,_@ItamarGreen agreed in a formal CS context - but I don't work in that context and I suspect few of your students understand the word 'contract' in the same way that either of us do. Accepted that Java has some supporting definition but I dislike it.,2017-06-11T13:22:57.957,41
804,558,0,[tag:interface] specifically isn't about the **user** interface it's about the object oriented programming interface.,2017-06-11T13:35:22.930,150
805,549,0,_@SeanHoulihane but this is about formal CS context o.o... Regardless You're right that only a few students understand the word contract in that way. That is why I asked this question.,2017-06-11T13:42:11.027,150
806,558,0,This analogy works. FedEx ask for payment a box and a destination. Whatever is in the box they'll ship it even if you put perishables in the box (or lithium batteries) and their shipping method isn't appropriate. They don't guarantee the contents arrive unharmed they just move the box and its contents. Mis-treat an API and you have a validation problem.,2017-06-11T13:48:54.570,41
807,520,1,Big thanks for the seconds tip really clever!,2017-06-11T14:39:14.793,51
808,503,0,_@richard Oh ok sorry for misunderstanding then. I'm mostly looking for suggestions on what conventions should I use and also on how strict should I enforce using them.,2017-06-11T14:42:57.450,51
809,520,0,Great answer but why no braces around if-bodies?,2017-06-11T14:47:54.303,283
810,520,0,I was imitating my students (j/k). In truth I don't typically use extra braces unless they are needed.  I don't like the extra use of vertical space and I find that indentation already makes the purpose clear.,2017-06-11T14:49:08.757,27
811,180,0,... in the past? (from the original question) e.g. going from when great-grandma may have been employed as a computer to computers shrinking from the size of a house to that of a speck of dust how good they have it not having to punch cards and etc.,2017-06-11T15:16:16.593,59
812,180,0,(from the original question) ... Are there any other merits of including the technology history? Or knowledge of historical computing frowned upon by mainstream CS educators?,2017-06-11T15:19:50.473,59
813,548,0,_@ItamarGreen It is broad but it is almost inherently so. Part of the question is even identifying *if* these tools illustrate CS concepts well. I knew it was somewhat open-ended but I tried to narrow it to short self-contained lessons at the high-school level. It's hard because I'm asking essentially if something is effective for on-topic CS discussion vis-a-vis its place in the CS classroom.,2017-06-11T15:50:53.897,76
814,570,0,I think there's a lot of value in that idea of creating documentation. That could also relate to our academic honesty conversation as students develop original docs for their programs.,2017-06-11T16:17:02.983,76
815,571,1,Good point about languages. I'm sure C would be different if it were replaced now and it's pretty mainstream in the right domains.,2017-06-11T16:45:44.753,41
816,180,0,_@hotpaw2 I edited those at because I saw the questions left as covering those areas implicitly. Asking further questions can often muddy the waters. Limiting it to 1-2 questions keeps the scope narrow enough for a precise answer.,2017-06-11T17:01:20.937,76
817,580,1,But might not history be part of the central story?  Physics class labs often include significant time repeating some of Archimedes and Galileo's ancient experiments before moving on to tensors statistical mechanics etc.,2017-06-11T18:03:15.400,59
818,580,0,Good point! I fleshed out my answer to clarify.,2017-06-11T18:23:37.290,27
819,582,0,the score for the review was the same as the score for the underlying program itself - very interesting idea.  How can you convince someone else to look at your work when there is such a threatening grading policy?,2017-06-11T19:14:09.573,27
820,582,0,_@Ben I.: First of all the scores were additive not averaged. So you could get the same cumulative score 80 for 10 programs or reviews with an average score of 8 or 8 items with all 10s. Even so there was a time constraint. So this one go-to guy had his pick of the best programmers etc. He was not the best programmer but the best editor. Essentially the class sorted itself out with programmers and reviewers finding counterparts of roughly equal caliber barring interpersonal factors (e.g. the three girls in the class mostly reviewed each other's work).,2017-06-11T19:20:28.193,613
821,582,0,If I get time I'm going to work up a question about this idea... students reviewing students. Or someone else can ask. That would be a very interesting discussion indeed!,2017-06-11T19:34:25.167,27
822,505,0,Suggested new title 'The importance of wrtiting code where the intent is explicit'. I don't quite like that title but feels closer to what you're asking maybe.,2017-06-11T20:35:54.640,41
823,527,1,_@SeanHoulihane Unfortunately the former (how to program) is not on topic. The focus of this site is educators discussing teaching methodologies but this question (and the top answer) has an air of when to use which loop? rather than **how to teach it.** The lower-scored answers are more on task but I was concerned that this thread took the direction it did.,2017-06-11T23:39:57.053,23
825,477,0,Thank you for the edit! I think that the real reason we closed this question is because of this line: Any thoughts about what to cover what not to cover how to cover things effectively are welcome! It's really broad. I'd vote to reopen if you changed it to something like How do the topics seem to you given <constraints of class>? Anything you'd add/remove/change? Also making the title more general (e.g. instead of nonmajor CS0 gen ed CS course) and also more specific (e.g. being more specific with good/bad topics).,2017-06-12T00:40:01.593,58
826,477,0,Also just as a clarification to address your edit summary none of us are moderators. We're just high-ish rep users. This site only has a SE employee moderator until it goes into public beta.,2017-06-12T01:00:36.787,58
827,477,1,It feels like we're getting much closer to a viable question here.  What is CS0?  Or CS1? I am based in the states and I have never heard of these things. I can make guesses about what they might be but they would just be guesses.,2017-06-12T01:02:11.517,27
828,477,1,If you're interested in discussing how we could narrow the scope of your question with us feel free to say something in [the chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174). We'd be happy to talk about how to improve the question.,2017-06-12T01:17:35.050,58
829,19,0,_@Peter:I have (hopefully) narrowed the question by asking for whether this meets minimum requirements/entry point as opposed to best practices and wonder if the question can be reopened in its current form.,2017-06-12T02:46:37.643,613
832,583,5,This is not an answer so I'll leave it here in the comments. I think you'll like this [figure](https://dotdev.co/passing-value-reference/#.70h19fmm9),2017-06-12T11:23:50.450,116
833,590,0,Is there a reason you don't just teach them git? Why are they so terrified of the command line?,2017-06-12T12:38:35.130,58
834,591,0,We are standardized on Eclipse so I have to use it (and it works well in any case). Command line is too much to ask of students who are struggling to learn programming language syntax. I was really hoping that someone else has done the same thing.,2017-06-12T13:07:22.357,623
835,592,0,urrm. why don't you have `break;` in each case? I thought it was necessary...,2017-06-12T15:04:39.227,150
836,592,0,The choice about where (and if) to use `break`s is the great strength of the structure. If you put a break in every case you will be back to an `if`/`else` structure. But if you skip some... try running the code =D,2017-06-12T15:06:09.443,27
837,592,0,It will create chains won't it?,2017-06-12T15:09:36.500,150
838,592,1,I could tell you but that would spoil the surprise.  (SPOILER ALERT: yes it does.),2017-06-12T15:14:35.240,27
839,592,1,If the students have been introduced to the clean code concept the switch/case construct is easier to read even if there's a `break` for each case. Makes it obvious that it _is_ a multi-branch decision point.,2017-06-12T15:23:34.243,104
840,445,0,I'm a big fan of giving strong student's extra responsibilities. Research points to deeper learning and understanding of material through teaching it to others and that's certainly been my experience with students as well. If the student can check their attitude about the way that the course is being taught they could become an excellent asset to helping bring up students who are falling behind. Why not make use of that?,2017-06-12T16:12:23.313,629
841,521,1,This would fit more into the category of general ML but I appreciate your sharing the resource.  Here are my recommendations for similar resources: [https://sigai.acm.org/static/aimatters/3-2/AIMatters-3-2-05-Neller.pdf](https://sigai.acm.org/static/aimatters/3-2/AIMatters-3-2-05-Neller.pdf) Thanks!,2017-06-12T18:38:52.120,589
843,598,2,Welcome to CSE.SE!  This question needs some more detail.  What is the level of the students in question?  And are you literally only asking for an opener?,2017-06-12T21:05:31.663,27
844,521,0,_@ProfPlum Agreed - I was just thinking that depending on the level of expertise a short crash course on ML would be a good thing to have before diving into DL given no prior background.,2017-06-12T21:14:49.273,76
845,19,0,_@TomAu Absolutely - it has my nomination for reopening certainly. Thanks for the revision.,2017-06-12T21:15:28.840,76
846,598,2,It would help us to give better answers if you could tell us the general methods you have tried and what seems to be the part that they don't grasp. It would also be help if you told us the context for this. Is it in preparation for a functional language or for closures in a procedural language or some other context entirely?,2017-06-12T22:48:50.093,104
847,160,0,Switching from Scratch to Python will probably feel like switching from space travel to inventing the wheel.,2017-06-13T05:12:15.477,104
848,144,2,_@SeanHoulihane How much has TCP/IP changed since the 1970s? Where would this site be if nobody understood such ancient technology? Sometime one cannot escape the current real-world application of ancient technology. Were relevant it must still be a _modern education topic_.,2017-06-13T06:12:43.677,104
849,144,3,_@GypsySpellweaver - not quite sure I get your meaning but I see legacy constructs holding back design all the time. Teaching legacy stuff as if it had meaning is a big mistake.,2017-06-13T07:28:18.813,41
850,82,1,Also keep in mind that -as noted in [PEP-373](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/)- in [2020](https://pythonclock.org/) Python 2.X will be retired...,2017-06-13T10:03:22.897,306
851,613,0,Where this breaks down I think is in the tricky case. (Apologies for the lack of formatting but comments don't seem to permit them)  `public void silly(int[] g){ g[0] = 7; g = new int[10]; g[1] = 7; }`,2017-06-13T10:35:28.643,27
854,613,0,_@BenI. Oh you are right this is by no means a perfect analogy. I use this to explain the basic concept of passing variables between subroutines and functions and to help with one specific question I got a lot of times: how come it is called *abc* in one routine and *xyz* in the other if it is the same thing?,2017-06-13T11:15:31.810,51
855,599,0,To those who might not be familiar with ap cs a curriculum could you please give a link (perhaps in a comment as it is not overly needed in the question itself) to a list of subjects covered?,2017-06-13T11:56:14.243,150
856,599,0,(unable to edit the comment anymore but it's still useful to explain why there's need for a footnote in your question) The footnote works just fine thanks.,2017-06-13T15:34:03.373,150
857,612,1,To make things clearer try using a scalar rather than a list. The implicit loop of `forEach` muddies the water. And maybe try using an assignment rather than printing inside the lambda expression. `KISS` principle.,2017-06-13T17:12:12.903,104
858,599,1,Here is the course description as of 2014: https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-a-course-description.pdf,2017-06-13T17:25:21.300,265
860,612,0,_@GypsySpellweaver a scalar?,2017-06-13T18:05:20.877,150
861,621,0,The question seemed a bit odd. Does the OP have a plethora of students scoring 5? If so that's an anomaly and congrats. Certainly we can use many topics to explore CS but time is short in a CS AP class and there's a lot to be covered. Perhaps the time might be better spent exploring the topics covered on the AP test more thoroughly? Perhaps an array game?,2017-06-13T18:10:23.937,636
862,599,0,Add it after they take the AP test. We have a couple weeks of school after the test.,2017-06-13T18:11:03.823,636
863,612,0,Single item not a list or structure such as int double chat etc.,2017-06-13T18:16:21.787,104
864,621,0,We do indeed. We have an usual program with a HS CS major along with a 4-year core CS curriculum. My AP CS A kids enter the course about half a year ahead. They also simultaneously take a separate CS course so they are learning linked list trees and some low-level concepts. This means that though I cover the AP curriculum I have a lot of latitude (and a duty!) to include other important concepts.,2017-06-13T18:24:43.320,27
865,612,0,In any OO language you can implement lambda expressions: first create an interface `lambda_string` with method `doit( value:string )`. Now implement `foreach_string( l: list of string  L: lambda_string )`. Now show how to create in instance of `lambda_string`. One you have that done do it again with templates/generics. Now explain that `l -> {?€?}` is syntactic sugar for what you just did.,2017-06-13T18:29:12.287,204
867,622,2,Welcome to CS Educators stack exchange! This question could really use more details. Is there an example that would help us see the problem you are facing (for example an algorithm which you would call poorly-crafted)? Please add some details to help us help you.,2017-06-13T18:47:27.173,150
868,622,0,_@ItamarGreen I edited,2017-06-13T18:59:42.740,639
869,622,1,thank you. Now it's much clearer. However I would also add what the algorithm is supposed to do.,2017-06-13T19:01:44.683,150
870,624,0,But the key is that most school code isn't run on big data so slow solutions won't be detected. The ideal situation would be to find the problem in the phase of designing solution.,2017-06-13T19:02:20.303,639
871,624,2,As I said I think that's just practice. Also there isn't anything stopping you from working on big data is there? If you really wanted to estimate the efficiency of an algorithm that's what big O is for.,2017-06-13T19:03:07.553,58
873,625,1,You meant $n \log{n}$ right?,2017-06-13T19:29:38.490,639
874,625,0,Yes I'll fix it. (Oops),2017-06-13T19:30:10.477,150

878,628,2,_@GypsySpellweaver typos occur all the time if you write your code on paper,2017-06-13T20:44:58.723,118
879,629,1,But do you think that this also applies to more advanced programming courses?,2017-06-13T20:53:52.063,118
880,629,1,_@Safirah What's your definition of 'advanced programming course'?,2017-06-13T21:05:55.977,16

883,629,2,Will you say the same if the students are given some normal text editors with ability to compile rather than IDEs ?,2017-06-14T00:30:58.807,656
884,628,10,Dijkstra never used a computer.,2017-06-14T00:52:46.990,659
885,421,1,On hold so I can't answer but you've found the difference between teaching at a community college (or equivalent) and a university.,2017-06-14T01:44:56.687,662
886,628,31,Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. [Dijkstra].  Paper tests are still relevant for CS courses.,2017-06-14T02:43:58.877,664
887,629,1,As far as I'm concerned programmers shouldn't worry about things the system is going to deal with.  I don't memorize anything like all the signatures--I know basically what's going to be wanted but let the IDE show me the details for anything I don't use all the time.,2017-06-14T04:24:54.627,668
888,628,1,See a similar discussion here https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/89/should-i-have-written-tests-on-basic-programming-skills,2017-06-14T04:33:24.660,76
889,636,2,this answer does answer the question but it's not entirely to the question. The question asks about written tests *about code* and not about cs in general. You are right that CS is more than just code but that is not relevant to the question.,2017-06-14T06:20:51.033,150
890,637,0,Welcome to CSeducators Stack Exchange! This is a very good answer and quite to the point. Well done,2017-06-14T06:36:28.570,150
891,629,0,I'd say this is a little too purist for my experience in the software industry; I think having students being able to reason out a problem in broad strokes and pseudocode on paper is a good thing but the IDEs and dev-tools are there to help. This would be like saying that a worker in a car factory should be able to hand assemble every part of the car instead of relying on the robots. Technology and tools move on even with the benefit of an IDE a bad coder is a bad coder doesn't matter if it's on a computer or paper.,2017-06-14T07:32:33.743,678
892,629,5,As a uni student and programmer in my experience the courses have two parts. The first is assignments and/or computerised tests. These are throughout the course heavy in programming and done on a computer usually at home or in labs. The second is exams. These are the end of semester ones. They almost never expect you to write code and rarely expect you to read code. This is because the course tests your coding ability through other parts of the course. The exam is about verifying that you understand the concepts that they have been teaching in the course so are typically wordy answers.,2017-06-14T07:51:01.873,681
894,640,1,_@SagarV you're welcome. However I would wait with accepting this answer. Someone might have a much better one and if there's already an accepted answer they might not give their own answer ;),2017-06-14T08:35:18.810,150
895,640,0,Yeah. But since this site is in beta stats are very important. The number of questions with no accepted answer should be kept minimum.  for that only I accepted. Let's wait.,2017-06-14T08:37:27.687,97
896,640,0,_@SagarV as you wish. It is true that we have seen quite a few answers being added after one's accepted.,2017-06-14T08:39:08.770,150
897,635,4,You have to acknowledge that for some (frequently extremely talented) individuals this forcing will be stressful and counterproductive - but as a generalisation you make very valid points.,2017-06-14T09:18:23.770,41
898,641,1,Welcome to Computer Science Educators Stack Exchange! This answer looks good but it doesn't explain how one can teach how to write optimized code. If you could edit it so it would better answer that it would be a lot better.,2017-06-14T09:34:37.350,150
899,644,0,Those real world examples are very handy. They also fit in well with the lesson plan. Thanks!,2017-06-14T09:56:23.193,150
901,634,7,+1 Great motivational answer. It would almost be funny if that were not what is actually happening in the real world (in businesses) a lot in practice - programming by trial&error.,2017-06-14T13:01:16.310,652
903,634,2,I'm a career teacher and your comment just made me sad. *Is that really what goes on?*,2017-06-14T13:12:27.583,27
904,634,0,Not always but often...,2017-06-14T13:16:04.520,652
905,634,13,_@BenI.: As a maintenance coder of 17 years' experience digging through other people's code I can say this is *exactly* what is going on far too often.,2017-06-14T13:16:13.220,706
906,650,2,Your link doesn't go to a task prompt,2017-06-14T14:41:53.680,27
907,650,0,It's the Specimen NEA Project Brief on the link in the question. There's also a link to the exam board's pseudocode spec at the bottom of the Sample Assessment Materials document,2017-06-14T15:46:30.557,674

909,634,6,As sad as it is that's very common. Even worse the offenders are usually schooled while the ones _not_ doing this are typically self-educated. The first group learn to pass classes the latter learned the language and how to use it.,2017-06-14T16:35:40.737,104
911,654,4,Upvoted because I believe this contributes to the conversation though I obviously disagree with your conclusion. How do you get around the problems in my post and in @AnoE?,2017-06-14T16:49:54.343,27
912,655,1,That's a really clear example. Nice!,2017-06-14T17:02:15.013,27
913,628,9,IMO it depends on what you're teaching. Traditional CS is as much about theory as anything so the knowledge and understanding is what's important. If you're teaching coding and/or for real world usage. (e.g. a 3 month intensive iOS program) then much of what's important is one's ability to use the tools available to them so a paper test would likely be kind of terrible.,2017-06-14T17:02:27.867,724
914,654,0,_@ben-i I think AnoE's answer covers more advanced courses where coding is not the primary focus. If so they may be entirely correct though I would still argue that typing responses rather than writing could be of some benefit. Your answer has a good point of being able to fake understanding with the help of prompts but time is often a limiting factor in a test. There is only so many random changes you can try before running out of time. This should not be a common occurrence unless the time given is much greater than the difficulty of the task.,2017-06-14T17:20:57.863,715
915,633,2,I had a similar experience. We had some Pascal in the first year and after that professors assumed we are able to code: You have to do some exercises on operating systems? Go get a C book and learn it yourself.,2017-06-14T17:22:19.793,729
916,659,1,Can you elaborate here on some of those criticisms? It's helpful for us to have answers here rather than on a site linked out to. Thanks!,2017-06-14T17:25:47.483,76
917,639,4,What is wrong with lots of variables? Can you give an example? It is better to not reuse variables to never re-assign to a variable. This will make the code easier to understand for the human and for the optimiser. Over optimised code is hard to optimise.,2017-06-14T17:30:06.557,204
918,659,0,_@Peter it's a large well-thought-out piece building on especially Papert's constructionism research with the sections following on each other. It will take away from the impact of everything he says to quote smaller sections. Which is why I only mentioned the _types_ of things he criticizes in Processing (and other systems) such as poor readability not making computation visible etc. as I mention in my answer.,2017-06-14T17:30:19.683,646
919,639,0,Memory consumption,2017-06-14T17:30:58.980,97
920,659,1,The criticisms in my opinion are more applicable to the Khan academy system rather than the tool. It's easy to poke holes in all of those self guided learning environments.  All programming languages / teaching tools have their ups and downs.  You can design wonderful educational experiences with processing and horrible ones as well.,2017-06-14T17:32:07.897,237
921,639,8,If your compiler dose not do variable folding in its optimisation step then get a better compiler. Optimise for readability and Big O. Leave the rest to the optimiser (it's its  job). I have spent many a year as a software engineer trying to beet bad habits out of people. Mostly premature optimisation ?€?I have to do it that way to make it faster?€?. Every time there was no need to be faster and there efforts made it slower (by getting in the way of the optimiser). First make it work then if you need to make it fast (but measure to check that it does get faster).,2017-06-14T17:33:34.880,204

929,654,4,I think some of the criticisms you have (it's easy to get syntax wrong/not remembering certain methods can be fatal) can be solved by simply being more lenient with minor syntax issues while grading and by providing students with a cheatsheet listing all the built-in methods they might need to use (and perhaps even providing examples of syntax).,2017-06-14T17:53:21.673,732
930,634,0,I don't agree that CS students should take tests on paper but I really like this answer.,2017-06-14T17:53:38.727,733

933,654,3,Another potential problem with doing tests on computers is it makes it easier to cheat unless the instructor has full control over the computers being used which is often infeasible due to budget constraints or large class sizes. If the school has a competitive majors system and the intro course is an important part of admissions that only compounds the problem. (And of course this is always a potential problem in high school since students want high grades for college admissions).,2017-06-14T17:55:30.787,732
934,659,0,_@MikeZamansky I don't agree re applicability. Although some of the criticisms could be said to _only_ be applicable to a system with higher levels of liveness (liveness itself being a good thing which Processing does not have) most are not -- such as the criticism of the [design decisions that were made when creating the] Processing language/environment itself in the Language section of the essay touching on Identity and Metaphor Decomposition Recomposition (global state modes that alter the meaning / consequence of code) and Readability (context-sensitive memorisation ambiguity).,2017-06-14T17:56:43.047,646
935,654,5,I'd also like to point out that especially in US colleges/high schools students are expected to take a variety of other classes in other disciplines unrelated to their primary interest as a part of a 'general education' requirement (literature history other liberal arts classes). It's common in such classes to require students to write essays and short answers on papers during exams. As a result I think it's reasonable that STEM classes can expect students to do a comparable amount of writing on their exams.,2017-06-14T18:01:54.840,732
936,654,1,And finally about your comment up above -- I don't think all instructors try and add time pressure to their exams. Some instructors deliberately _remove_ time pressure by giving more time then they think is necessary for the benefit of students who don't work as well under pressure/to give students the opportunity to answer all the questions to the best of their ability. (After all if a student submits an incomplete answer how do we know whether that's because they didn't understand the material or because they're slow at writing/typing and ran out of time?),2017-06-14T18:07:14.190,732

939,633,1,On my CS course programming was a core module (Java) and other modules often included some coding elements (either real code or pseudo-code). In all cases code had to be written out on paper as the OP describes. IMO this answer spends way too long describing your particular CS course and making assumptions that don't necessarily generalize well and not long enough addressing the actual question (advantages of paper vs computer).,2017-06-14T18:16:57.173,735
940,659,0,_@Peter if you've read the essay you (and everyone else of course) are very welcome to share suggestions for which criticisms to put in this answer like you asked -- I can't actually think of any that won't reduce the impact of reading the essay in its entirety. If I agree with the suggestions I'm more than happy to edit my answer for the sake of everyone reading it. Thanks!,2017-06-14T18:20:24.087,646

945,654,1,_@Michael0x2a My own experience would disagree with most of your points. However let me address it point by point. Cheatsheets with syntax provided by instructors could solve a part of the problem. I have never seen it done and I doubt a useful one could be put together easily though. And again this could as easily be solved by the functionality of an IDE that will tell you that a List has the add method rather than include or something like that. Cheating IS a huge issue that would need to be addressed. Disabling/Removing the WiFi adapters is a possibility if computers can be provided.,2017-06-14T19:12:38.263,715
947,654,0,_@Michael0x2a I do not think that applying the standard of Gen Ed. classes to CS is either fair or relevant. By that logic all classes should require students to write at least 3 research essays per semester/quarter because English does. And finally regarding the time issue. Yes most institutions allow you to request extended time for tests. However I have never went through the process myself so I am not sure how well I'm not used to coding on paper will fly as reasoning for that. Besides that I have often seen about 50% of class take all of the allotted time. So it's not that generous.,2017-06-14T19:18:09.490,715

977,640,1,Since the user input is by far the slowest part of this example doing it in one or two loops won't really be any more or less efficient in terms of computation. On the other hand I think that entering matrices in this interleaved fashion is less natural than reading in one than another and thus ends with a bad user experience.  I'd say better to use one loop but factor out the code into an enter_martrix() function that prompts the user gets the input and then returns the matrix.,2017-06-14T21:28:31.890,237
983,634,1,_@nocomprende This also ends up making it even more difficult to figure out what was wrong in the first place since by the time you are looking at the code they have no idea what it does and no idea where they veered off the correct path.,2017-06-14T22:31:33.547,753

I learned to take tests as a separate skill in its own right and graduated with a 3.9 GPA so I definitely know how this works.

1035,633,0,This is the answer I most agree with so I will add my own anecdote. I am a fairly recent graduate of both a BS/MS in CS from a mid-level state university and I took three years of CS in high school. In all of these programs tests were handwritten and focused mostly on answering theoretical questions drawing diagrams and only rarely did we debug code or write our own (and handwriting LISP is a massive pain). Quizzes were also handwritten but focused on pseudocode to describe a concept. Assignments were the true coding projects. CS is about theory not how to write language X.,2017-06-15T14:55:21.187,788

1048,654,0,_@hucancode This could be a difference in approach. I tend to resort to pen and paper when I need to write out a logic chain or a particularly tangled set of business requirements. This rarely takes the form of code and is a far cry from a fleshed out solution. It provides a structure for the code that I will write later. This is very different than what is required on pen and paper tests where you are expected to present a code that will compile with no issues if plugged into a computer in order receive top marks.,2017-06-15T17:19:14.143,715

1054,693,0,There is no such thing as a procedure that returns something. Procedures are subroutines that do something. A function is a subroutine that has no side effects and returns something.

1083,669,0,You'll have a queue or you can choose to grade by student by activity by course. One option is to go problem by problem. You can first see the student has passed the automatic checks. Then you'll be able to review their code and send by any comments before jumping to the next student submission. You can also use Fast Grade mode -- which is helpful when you are very familiar with the problems and are commenting mostly on coding style. You'll be able to say a problem passes or send it back to the student as needs work.,2017-06-15T23:21:01.097,745
1084,706,0,This question should not be closed; it is asking for how folks think through their copying policy on labs. It certainly falls under [good subjective](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/) in my book.,2017-06-16T01:24:47.273,27

1086,628,3,Why do most answers assume that the only alternative to paper is a fully featured IDE and not a minimalistic plaintext editor like notepad? The biggest advantage of using a text editor over paper is that it supports insertions.,2017-06-16T08:41:13.927,839
1087,173,2,Just to present the other side of the coin see Bret Victor's [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) essay that looks at (conceptually & concretely) language/environment design for learning to program with. He says **JavaScript and Processing are poorly-designed languages that support weak ways of thinking and ignore decades of learning about learning.** when considering readability making computation visible decomposition recomposition and more. It has global state modes that alter the meaning of a line of code etc. so not great for learners specifically.,2017-06-16T08:41:45.977,646

1121,628,0,FWIW I barely used a computer at all in my first 2 years of my CS degree and think I got a good education. In my later two years I did a lot more programming for classes but it was never really the focus.,2017-06-16T14:35:53.880,869
1122,7,0,Students *do not* prefer to deal with the IDE. That's just a frustration point. That actually brings another point. Newbies don't know any IDEs so they'll use whatever the teacher thinks is best not the actual good tools.,2017-06-16T14:39:11.883,28

1126,734,0,I did almost exactly this lesson for years but I added a computer program into the mix - I created a PB&J simulator with a syntax and a set of instructions. They had to open and close drawers with their two hands take out plates knives etc... I pasted their code into my simulator and if the end result was a sandwich they were allowed to actually make it *only following their own instructions*.  There were some peanut-buttery hands in that classroom ;-),2017-06-16T15:20:20.077,27
1127,732,0,That's a much more intuitive example. Thanks!,2017-06-16T15:21:13.633,27
1129,733,2,This question is probably a little too broad at the minute?€?are there any more *specific* constraints that you have to narrow down the answer set? At the minute there are many languages that *might* help but it'd be helpful to describe exactly what the tools for expert programmers are. Also 2D games or 3D (or both)? Do you want a general purpose language or would a game-specific language/framework be useful?,2017-06-16T15:26:20.147,2
1131,728,5,Does it have to be black board or would you like other unplugged ideas?,2017-06-16T15:57:23.193,204
1132,733,1,I have some potential answers for this but it depends on age and where you want your advanced students to go. A little more information re: background language and objectives for how advanced you want the developers to be would help.,2017-06-16T15:58:40.760,76
1133,706,0,Sean sorry to be unclear here -- all I meant by that is that professionals copy from within their codebase all the time -- for example when I'm making a new page on our website that's similar to a page we already have I start off by copy/pasting the other page and making changes--in any case this is all also part of the fuzziness and clarity that I think needs to be discussed and taught to new programmers.,2017-06-16T16:03:51.303,91
1134,690,0,_@nocomprende I agree that when teaching low-level programming then flow charts could be useful. I disagree about the 5 things (compare is arithmetic) there for there are 4 thinks (also logic is arithmetic and arithmetic is logic). You could also condense fetch and store into move now there are only 3 things. This is the von-noumen architecture (harvard as well). There are however other architectures.,2017-06-16T16:03:54.820,204
1135,733,0,Agree that it's pretty broad. Game programming could cover a ton of ground. And a beginner could be a 5 year old in kindergarten or a 35 year old career changer. There's a good discussion in here somewhere but I think it needs to be a little more focused.,2017-06-16T16:04:39.100,30
1136,724,0,The point is that 'things' have both a physical form but also a meta form.  Humans have a body and a name.  The physical form is the thing itself in all its nuance and complexity and is heavyweight and non-trivial to duplicate.  The meta form is a mere reference to physical and therefore lightweight and easy to reproduce.  I have only one phone and creating a duplicate of it would be a non-trivial thing to do but I can give my phone number out to millions of people with little cost.,2017-06-16T16:06:57.263,851
1137,727,0,I can not remember the complexity but busy beaver is easy to understand easy to prove a given solution and really really really hard to solve for more than 4 or 5 nodes. For 1 and 2 nodes it is trivial for around 3 it get to be an hours lesson. By 5 no one has done it yet.,2017-06-16T16:08:20.887,204
1138,736,0,Actually we have already considered Lua and Phyton/Pygame. Probably Phyton is a bit more beneficial as a programming language as it has a greater community.,2017-06-16T16:41:44.060,868

1140,728,1,_@richard Based on the context of this question (and the presence of other unplugged discussions) I think this question specifically focuses on projector v. board.,2017-06-16T16:51:36.977,76
1141,728,3,Alternatives I've seen are using a tablet pen to write/draw on-screen and a desk-mounted camera to project writing from a sheet of paper. Both were far more readable than a blackboard in a large lecture theatre where many students can be sitting far back.,2017-06-16T17:02:13.590,879
1142,733,2,Solid revision - makes this a much more answerable question now.,2017-06-16T17:06:25.820,76
1145,738,0,_@nocomprende Fortunately my projector and my blackboard don't overlap too much. (If you can't use them in parallel it sucks.),2017-06-16T17:11:08.930,877
1146,583,0,What part are they struggling about? Have you already established how references work (without function calls)?,2017-06-16T17:11:35.280,660
1148,724,1,You could if you want edit this explanation into your answer (by using the [edit link](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/posts/724/edit) on the bottom left side) so a new visitor doesn't have to read through the comments but can get everything by reading the answer - this is often considered good practice on Stack Exchange sites.,2017-06-16T17:13:49.927,793
1150,628,2,am I the only one who read this question as specific to exam questions where the candidate is expected to answer _in code_? All the answers and comments here about how computer science != coding and whatnot seem to be missing the point entirely. Of course it's fine to have to explain in words the intuition behind bubblesort etc. But it's also irrelevant to the question being asked. For me the question is if there is a question asking you to write a simple bubblesort implementation _in code_ shouldn't that part of the question be handled / compiled _on a computer_ as opposed to _on paper_?,2017-06-16T19:13:03.423,885

1152,701,2,This is the exact approach my first programming teacher used on my class.  Breaking down How do you make a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich in to individual steps is permanently associated with programming for me now.  It was immensely helpful.,2017-06-16T19:41:21.113,887
1153,672,1,Instead of comments I would consider outright asking for a (non necessarily super formal) proof of correctness. I value those immensely because I remember how I used to program before those were hammered in my head in Programming 101. It was not pretty.,2017-06-16T19:51:49.650,757

1155,173,0,_@Abraham - I'm curious - I was wowed by Bret Victor's talk a couple of years back like everyone else but what actually makes him an authority on learning? He seems to be a a CS guy and an interface designer. Has he been a teacher for any length of time? An education researcher (even though education research has a horrible reputation)?,2017-06-16T20:24:40.297,237
1158,743,0,I've done that with Dr. Seuss books. Cat & the Hat Returns is good for recursion. Too many Daves is good for arrays or lists.,2017-06-16T20:54:48.453,30
1159,748,0,Welcome to CSE!  We're very glad to have you here.  This answer needs a little work though. How will this help OP's students to think algorithmically?,2017-06-16T20:55:03.210,27
1160,748,0,In scratch you can visually build loops conditionals functions and return events it's a whole language that is more approachable to beginners and maybe might incite more their inquisitive nature.  It helps by literally making them shape visually an algorithm or program they could also share it with fellow students and get other code from the community it also has some fun features such as running a loop to play sounds or images.,2017-06-16T20:58:02.343,892
1161,748,0,Good improvements.  Keeping the quality of the questions and answers high here is a really big deal because it's what makes the whole enterprise worthwhile.  I hope to keep seeing you around the site!,2017-06-16T21:00:56.487,27
1162,366,1,As a high school educator using the student languages in the classroom I can vouch for this philosophy! The limited feature set of the Beginning Student Language allows for excellent error messages and allows students to feel they have the whole language in their heads. The Intermediate and Advanced Student Languages are the perfect small steps up.,2017-06-16T21:34:35.247,895
1163,173,1,_@MikeZamansky His work speaks for itself. The brilliance of it the research that evidently goes into it and the impact that it has. But also the organisations like MIT that invite him over the people like Alan Kay who more-than-endorse him etc. -- he is a design-for-humans genius. :) From human-computer interaction research and design at Apple to learn/understand/create research been working with Alan Kay and other comp sci education and learning sciences researchers (amongst others) in essence continuing the design-for-understanding-and-human-empowerment work of especially Seymour Papert,2017-06-16T22:38:10.873,646
1164,173,1,Got it - his work speaks for itself. Just like Bill Gates when he had his theories of how schools should be run.  I do think Victor's work is pretty cool and interesting but I wouldn't be willing say his personal theories are unquestionably correct until  they're vetted by actual teachers.  Plenty of teachers have had terrific results with those horrible tools.,2017-06-16T23:03:32.963,237
1166,749,0,This is a beautiful answer. Very well thought out. Welcome to CSE! I hope we hear more from you.,2017-06-17T01:44:19.310,27
1168,628,1,You are looking at it the wrong way.  Usually a test written on paper allows you to not get hung up by a missing semi-colen and get graded how well you expressed the algorithm/idea/ ectera.  If the problem is difficult to the point you'd have trouble doing it correctly on a computer you will probably score MUCH better on paper.,2017-06-17T02:32:37.053,900
1169,690,3,Agreed with other users that using common tasks (sandwich brushing etc..) is better.  I use shoe tying.  Yours is too broad a scope.  The site interaction you describe does stuff out of scope from the original description (Devise an algorithm that calculates a user?€?s paycheque).  An algorithm is *not* welcome messages and exit messages.  Tying your shoes doesn't include picking shoes to coordinate with your outfit from the closet.  Making a sandwich doesn't mean harvesting the grain to make bread.,2017-06-17T03:33:08.770,901
1170,628,0,_@apnorton It seems then that Dijkstra's point was that for studying theory of CS/astronomy no additional tools are necessary; however for studying practicals of CS/astronomy yes you're absolutely going to need a computer/telescope.?? Extrapolating that into a brief answer to this question?€? for CS fundamentals paper is fine; for code you should teach on / test on a computer.,2017-06-17T04:31:23.977,902
1171,751,0,This is a good answer but if you can add details about how Turtle Roy teaches you to think algorithmically it would really make this into a great answer.,2017-06-17T08:54:56.150,150
1173,639,1,Teaching really needs to be aligned with modern practices. Ideally using compilers which are being architected now since it will be some time before these students are productive.,2017-06-17T12:30:54.623,41
1174,753,1,Welcome to Computer Science educators! This answer doesn't exactly answer the question. The question asked about advantages of writing tests on paper and you answer is addressing disadvantages of doing tests on computers. While that is related it is not directly answering the question. Could you please edit your answer so that it addresses the advantages so it fits the question?,2017-06-17T12:39:35.143,150
1176,750,1,I never realized that sudoku-solving is an NP problem. I've assigned this as a (hard) lab before - I will do so again prior to the NP unit. And with the way it links to MT San's example... what a cool setup!,2017-06-17T13:48:52.027,27

1195,710,0,I don't know - having the K&R on hand and the previous homework seems borderline acceptable to me under the assumption that the test is not essentially a rehash of homework but offers instead an entirely new challenge. And are you telling me disabling USB ports on lab machines isn't the standard already? :),2017-06-17T17:34:13.547,757
1198,764,1,I feel like this might be leaning on the broad side; I can think of many that *might* fit your criteria (take a look through [this huge list](https://www.class-central.com/courses/recent?subject=cs&sort=rating-up&lang=english) to see what I mean). If you could narrow it down to one or two subjects and a specific level/objective it might be easier to give you a concrete recommendation.,2017-06-17T17:49:59.683,2
1199,764,0,By counting towards your transcript are talking about for college admission? If so that depends in part on what state you live in. The safest bet in that regard is to look out your local community colleges.,2017-06-17T18:10:57.130,76

1202,764,0,I removed what I felt were the truly subjective/impossible-to-answer requirements. Feel free to roll back if necessary but I think that one question will give you better results.,2017-06-17T19:32:55.037,76
1203,770,1,Please clarify what you mean by a explanation that does not include an example. Otherwise this may be a dup.  My answer in https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/299/simple-pointer-examples-in-c contains an explanation of an example.,2017-06-17T20:06:21.337,59

1206,764,0,_@Peter I'm sorry but it's rather important that it's cheap and really preferable that it's likely to count towards my transcript. I didn't roll back but simply added those two back in.,2017-06-17T21:06:43.183,919
1207,764,0,Fair point on the former. As for the latter I simply don't know think that that's a question appropriate for SE. You need to talk to your local school district about that issue.,2017-06-17T21:11:33.780,76

1218,305,2,_@Peter The code example is wrong because the unit for pointer arithmetic is the size of the pointed-to type. whatsthis + 4 points 4 ints ahead of whatsthis (Or rather it would if whatsthis were pointing into an array large enough to do that. The code as written invokes undefined behavior.),2017-06-18T06:31:56.133,935
1219,628,0,Wow things have changed. Back in 1996 I took the freshman intro CS class at an accredited university in the United States as a requirement for a BS in mathematics. The class was literally all coding in C++ on Solaris SPARC workstations using cxx as the compiler. We took our tests on paper and we had to write at least pseudo code for many answers (there were many purely theoretical questions as well) but we had the option to write answers with actual code in the language of our choice. Obviously we weren't graded harshly on typos or even omitted semicolons or everyone would have failed.,2017-06-18T07:03:04.753,939
1222,791,0,Could you please add a context? What is the level of the students?,2017-06-18T11:42:56.623,150
1224,793,0,I treat pancakes as stack popping the top one off and dunking it in the syrup that's sitting on the side. But that might just be me. :),2017-06-18T11:47:19.683,166
1225,793,1,Pancakes as a stack or as a queue -- is there anything they can't do???? :-),2017-06-18T11:54:42.403,237
1226,793,1,Stack or queue doesn't matter much they get consumed either way. That's something that's usually left out of stack lessons: that the stack is consumed. As to pancakes and what can't they do: Survive long on my plate. :),2017-06-18T11:59:25.417,104
1230,796,0,Of course but that's the *definition* of the stack. I'll definitely explain that as an origin to the name of the stack but I need some use-cases for programming and life. (I hope I'm clear enough),2017-06-18T12:41:34.307,77
1231,796,0,_@YotamSalmon then you should write that in your question. I'll edit my answer soon.,2017-06-18T12:44:00.420,150
1232,791,0,High school students I'm teaching next year for their ?????????? exam. They have only some  basic knowledge in procedural programming and the tip of the iceberg in Object-Oriented stuff.,2017-06-18T12:44:00.463,77
1233,791,0,Again you need to write these things in the question itself. BTW ?????????? are called matriculation exams (or finals) in english ;),2017-06-18T12:44:59.343,150
1234,791,0,I knew about the word matriculation just wasn't sure if those exams are actually known by this name (I have never heard anyone using this word in English so I wasn't confident about using it). Added the info to the question thank you for the tip.,2017-06-18T12:48:06.897,77
1235,796,0,_@YotamSalmon edited the answer :),2017-06-18T12:59:12.367,150
1244,628,0,I'm very grateful for all the answers this question has received so far. It really gave me a new perspective in the matter. Since there is really no correct answer in this case I'll choose as the correct answer the most popular one. But if you have an insight on this problem that was not mentioned here please post it it may be very helpfull!,2017-06-18T14:35:48.333,118
1245,305,0,_@EricMSchmidt I believe Ben I. was aware of this when posting the example. Even the undefined behavior can be teachable for students to learn pointers (and the precautions that one must take with them). At least I think this was intentional...,2017-06-18T14:38:49.537,76
1246,792,7,The spring-loaded stack of trays in a (university) cafeteria was in fact the origin of the name of the data structure at least according to common legend.,2017-06-18T14:41:47.530,945
1247,305,1,Yes the undefined behavior was the purpose of the exercise.  By arranging the demonstration so that the wrong variable gets modified it should both pique their interest and give a great entr??e to the idea of separating a memory address from the data it stores.,2017-06-18T15:00:41.040,27
1248,797,0,Possible duplicate of [Is it more effective to teach low level languages before high level ones or vice versa?](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/212/is-it-more-effective-to-teach-low-level-languages-before-high-level-ones-or-vice),2017-06-18T15:02:43.527,58
1249,633,2,Most of my CompSci education was theoretical.  There were assignments; write code get it working submit it etc.  That's not CompSci; that's the APPLICATION OF CompSci.  How does a red / black tree work? How is searching it O(log (n))? If you can't explain it how can you apply it? My Database class dealt extensively with relational model.  Most of it was done using algebraic notation.  Once I had that SQL was a breeze (2 class periods). Today I write pretty complex SQL. An exceptionally good mastery of one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer -- Dijkstra,2017-06-18T15:48:59.067,948
1254,786,0,what do you mean by a concrete walkway?,2017-06-18T16:27:12.787,150
1255,802,1,Wow that's a great example! I love it!,2017-06-18T16:27:24.900,77
1257,786,0,oh. Now i get it. I feel sort of *dense* now. (yes that pun was intended),2017-06-18T16:43:36.137,150
1261,791,0,Note that these analogies [can be very confusing](https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/76871/40243) to some people.,2017-06-18T17:06:32.270,953
1262,787,0,I know someone who will probably have a lot of insight about this issue - I will next see them on Monday the 3rd so I can ask them about it and post at that point,2017-06-18T17:07:55.643,27
1266,796,3,I would definitely mention the browser's back button. It provides a non-metaphorical example that's easy to understand and demonstratively proves that stacks are useful in programming.,2017-06-18T17:32:41.013,954
1268,806,0,I love that quote. Well played.,2017-06-18T17:39:15.960,150
1269,804,0,It's a nice example to be sure but if you try this with your class be aware that Shunting Yard can be tricky for kids who are just at the point where they are learning about stacks.  You have to break this one down very carefully for them.,2017-06-18T17:56:31.410,27
1270,126,4,_@richard no. they don't need to. otherwise you get stackoverflow.,2017-06-18T18:08:06.257,150
1271,791,0,_@nocomprende Yes it's based on the same idea,2017-06-18T18:17:27.197,77
1272,809,2,Nice with a cute ending :),2017-06-18T18:32:53.993,27
1274,126,0,_@ItamarGreen but as can be seen from the image the stack is a cat stack. If every can in a hat had a cat in there hat then the stack would not overflow because it would be infinite. This could lead to a very tall stack of cats but as each cat is getting smaller. it may be asymptotic. For example if each cat was half the size of the one bellow then the hight for an infinite number of cats would be 2??size_of_bottom_cat.,2017-06-18T20:57:52.197,204
1275,628,2,The problem with computer science (in English) is that the name is misleading. It's not about computers it's a science related to automatic processing of information. For instance in Italian (and Polish I've been told) it's called *Informatica* from *informazione* + *automatica*. Tests should be done on paper of course. The only time in 3+2 years I've done an exam with a computer it was a probability and statistics exam where we were *allowed* to use R as a calculator (the test was still on paper).,2017-06-18T21:23:04.220,963
1276,628,1,Also if coding on paper you are not distracted by typos and costantly trying to compile. There is a reason why we always tell beginners to *not* start coding until they have a clear sketch of their solution on paper (or by heart if it's a trivial problem). Coding **distracts** algorithmic thinking unless you've built some experience.,2017-06-18T21:23:58.923,963
1277,633,0,I agree with this answer although my experience is a bit different. Of course CS is not coding but in my BSc (University of Venice) functional programming imperative programming and OOP were all mandatory courses. You expect that a computer scientist can turn an algorithm into code. I finished my MSc in 2016 FWIW. But still programming is just a tool and CS is much more... today many improvised coders don't seem to understand this. Serious tests shall always be on paper while assignments can be practical.,2017-06-18T21:30:36.430,963
1278,634,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I do not know where you are from but from my experience it's quite different. Yes there are not very good CS students but the software development field is often filled with improvised coders who just learnt a language following some tutorial without knowing a bit about algorithms data structures complexity formal languages ... you name it. Or designers who suddendly are web developers because they tried Dreamweaver.,2017-06-18T21:35:14.053,963
1279,634,0,_@AaronD please note that science and engineering are different fields. They do overlap on some stuff but differ on other. Even though many CS and CE people become software developers this doesn't mean that they have the same background. An engineer can beat a scientist on some stuff and viceversa. No-one is better than the other but they differ.,2017-06-18T21:37:01.273,963
1280,474,3,For any language/compiler that supports tail-call optimisation there is no use of the stack for recursion.???€? That is only true if the recursive call is a tail call i.e. for tail-recursive calls. Traversing a tree for example is *not* trivially tail-recursive since you have a recursive call for every branch and there can be at most one tail-recursive call. (You *can* make it tail-recursive by introducing a stack which you manage yourself of course.),2017-06-19T00:01:14.573,945
1281,474,3,Also Scala does not support Proper Tail Calls. It only supports Direct Tail Recursion i.e. Tail Recursion where a method *directly* calls itself in tail position. (And directly calls itself means that the method must be `final` otherwise there would be no guarantee where the call is dynamically dispatched to!),2017-06-19T00:02:33.617,945
1282,452,0,You don't need a base case. `def receive(event): process(event); receive(eventstream.next); end` is a perfectly good way of writing an operating system for example. Operating systems don't have a base case they should *never* stop.,2017-06-19T00:04:55.923,945
1283,820,1,Excellent post and welcome to CSE. *I take as an axiom that lecturing to students who are looking at computer screens is an effectively pure waste of time.* That really drove the point home for me. Next year [I will require note-taking by hand](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/327/note-taking-policy-laptops-or-by-hand). I hope we hear more from you!,2017-06-19T02:21:54.630,27
1284,821,0,Welcome to CSE! Good example about processing interruptions.  But isn't Matthew 20:16 really more of an example of list reversal? ;-)  I hope we'll hear more from you in the future.,2017-06-19T03:06:01.750,27
1285,824,6,Welcome to CSE!  There are some great ideas in this post but I must disagree with easily.  Have you tried explaining something like your `mv \`grep -Ril 'business\|work' .\` ./work` to kids who have never used a POSIX prompt to so much as `ls`?  Having done it I promise it ain't so easy to explain ;),2017-06-19T04:54:37.950,27
1286,633,2,_@Skipp Computer Science is about computers in the same way Astronomy is about Telescopes (misquote of Edsger W. Dijkstra).  Would you say astronomy is a superset of telescope operation?,2017-06-19T06:04:29.407,978
1287,825,0,They can always use CLI to create a GUI :),2017-06-19T06:16:23.907,104
1288,825,0,_@GypsySpellweaver redundant... But true. No GUI tool can create other GUI tools in such a way...,2017-06-19T06:18:38.467,150
1289,824,0,I think these are good examples iff the students already know the CLI OTOH if they don't it'll be convincing the other way. In the GUI they can search and sort with fair ease and accomplish all the given tasks  faster than they can create the given commands.,2017-06-19T06:36:49.640,104
1290,612,0,I am trying to explain how they are interpreted by the JVM and what they unfold into.???€? Why? I mean I get that the whole machinery using [`java.lang.invoke`](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/package-summary.html) `invokedynamic` `MethodHandle` bootstrap methods `MethodType` and the [`LambdaMetafactory`](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/LambdaMetafactory.html) is very interesting but I don't think it is a good thing to teach. It is after all full of implementation details and clever tricks for performance.,2017-06-19T06:42:18.930,945
1291,612,0,_@J??rgWMittag Clever tricks for performance is key. I want students to learn why they're useful. And that is part of it.,2017-06-19T06:44:57.267,150
1292,612,0,Sure but the whole machinery is probably going to take a long time to explain unless the students are already intimately familiar with JSR-292 `invokedynamic` bootstrap methods `MethodHandle`s and so on. I certainly don't know how it works I freely admit. It *really* is a very clever machinery with lots of moving interrelated parts. (Or maybe I am wrong and it is totally simple I just haven't seen it yet. Feel free to correct me.),2017-06-19T06:48:35.567,945
1293,812,6,Two words: scripting and communication. Knowing the command line is knowing how to write OS scripts to automate your drudgery. It's also an unambiguous way to tell someone what must be done. Even if you prefer GUIs for some other tasks the command line is *vastly* superior for these tasks.,2017-06-19T07:45:10.073,981
1294,824,4,To be fair that script doesn't look easy to come up with.,2017-06-19T07:48:07.333,981
1295,824,1,Other idea of tasks : Remove all the temporary file with a ~ inside a directory with thousands of files (rm *~ vs clicking). Change the owner of files recursively in a very big directory tree... Doing makefile in order to generate C code latex code plantuml diagram...,2017-06-19T08:40:23.983,985
1296,813,23,I'm sorry for being pedantic but this is important if you are teaching people. Your simple little script is full of bad practices. It will [fail on any slightly non-standard file name](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/131766/22222). *Please* don't show things like that to your class. You are parsing `ls` in a way that is i) unnecessary (`for i in *gif; do ...`) ii) unsafe (see [here](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs) iii) very fragile (if you *must* parse `ls` at least use `while -r` and  [quote your variables](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/171346/22222).,2017-06-19T08:42:28.367,986
1297,633,0,You can have great coders who have not the faintest idea about CS (and vice versa I assume) Vice versa: Alan Turing is considered a great computer scientist but he died around the time the first programming languages were invented (the 50's).  So you assumption seems correct.,2017-06-19T08:43:49.183,987
1298,813,1,Aso the `f=\`basename $i .gif\`` would be better expressed as `f=$(basename $i .gif)` or even better without calling an external command at all: `f=${var%%.gif}`.,2017-06-19T08:51:01.963,986
1299,792,0,I had an A-Level computing teacher who got so carried away with explaining the mechanism of the stack of plates he forgot that he was supposed to actually be explaining a stack in computing terms.,2017-06-19T08:54:11.060,988
1300,633,0,_@rubdos: Nice! I've integrated it into the answer.,2017-06-19T09:12:14.430,652
1301,633,0,Hey AnoE @username won't work in answers; you can however put a link to the comment if you want to (right click the comment's time copy that link),2017-06-19T09:13:34.037,987
1302,633,0,_@all: while I see what you mean with the != discussion it's just a qip to show the gist of the answer on first glance. I believe the stylized != is ubiquitous enough to carry the intended meaning.,2017-06-19T09:14:25.633,652
1303,824,6,`s/easily/efficiently`,2017-06-19T09:59:10.027,993
1304,824,0,_@GypsySpellweaver that's why you (as someone who knows the CLI) would 'race' them to do the same task concurrently (on different machines),2017-06-19T10:00:13.713,993
1305,813,0,_@terdon I agree with you but if my years in academia taught me something is that almost every snippet provided by a teacher includes: i) no error check/recovery ii) at least two minor/one major bad practices iii) failure in every slightly edge(ish) case iv) (optional) it doesn't work at all as written. So... the example is pretty much perfect. Very academy.,2017-06-19T10:01:27.167,994
1306,824,0,Addition to the workload - make it nested directories with mixed content and different rules for each. (e.g. pics in 'business' folder go to the 'work' directory others go to the images/photo album directory).  Command line only needs a glob the gui user will have to navigate between them,2017-06-19T10:03:03.780,993
1307,813,0,_@terdon - yes but sometimes honestly not in the real world and the distinction is worth talking about in class. This is an interactive throwaway and it wouldn't be typed in with just an enter.The line that actually does stuff - convert - would first be done with echo to check the command before running. Beyond that I'd leave it as is since it would have been tested on it's specific use and would work and it got the job done.  I did have a couple of mistakes above (which the echo line would have caught had I done this in  a shell) - I fixed those now for post correctness.\,2017-06-19T10:12:34.890,237
1308,813,20,No it won't work. That's the problem. Try it on a file called `foo bar.gif` let alone `foo\nbar.gif`. Your throwaway only works for very simple cases and is actually far more complex and daunting than it needs to be: `for f in *gif; do convert $f -resize 200x200 smaller-$f; done`. The `basename` is pointless since you're not recursing so it only removes the `.gif` which you then add back again. And this simpler version can deal with arbitrary file names. In any case teaching people the robust portable and correct way is always better than throwaway hacks that will fail easily.,2017-06-19T10:21:48.220,986
1310,813,0,_@terdon - yes for my purposes it will. I don't put spaces in my filenames - if If that were possibly the case when I used it I would have quoted.  On the other hand I've had cases where the for doesn't work as well as the while.   More complex and daunting is also a subjective measure.  I gain tremendously from my use of the command line hence it's worth doing for me. If some other way of going about working is easier for you that's fine for you but the easiest solution is the one that you come up with.,2017-06-19T11:00:09.963,237
1311,813,5,There are no cases (like this) where the `while` works better than `for`. You might be thinking of `for i in $(ls *gif)` which is indeed even worse that what you suggest here. But I do get your point about the easiest being whatever you come up with. And that would be absolutely fine if you were doing it for yourself. If however you use this to teach people then it is not fine and is actively harmful. Do whatever you like at home but please don't teach bad practices to your students. It's bad for them and bad for whichever poor schmuck hires them and they screw up their server.,2017-06-19T11:11:14.593,986
1312,770,0,Does this have to be in C? C is heavily criticized for its design wrt memory management pointers in particular. If you could avoid using C there are plenty of languages where some of the problems endemic to it have been avoided for example OCaml Pascal Go even Forth to some degree.,2017-06-19T11:22:17.420,1000
1313,835,0,Welcome to Computer Science Educators! Could you add some details on how the first two are an example of a stack?,2017-06-19T11:24:52.317,150
1314,835,0,_@ItamarGreen OK.,2017-06-19T11:31:41.183,1000
1315,835,0,The first example really is a **very** good one.,2017-06-19T11:37:23.613,150
1316,813,0,There are contexts where they behave differently - that's  how many years (decades) ago I learned about the while when my first exposure was a for.   The original question was about command line --throw away by definition - not writing script.  Don't worry about my students they do fine - actually much more than fine.,2017-06-19T11:39:56.497,237
1317,838,1,This is a good point. Welcome to CSE! I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-06-19T12:23:29.933,27
1318,837,1,Ridiculous anachronism  Is it safe to assume that you believe that paper should be banned in geometry and calculus classes as well?,2017-06-19T12:32:45.010,27
1319,791,0,Forth language (or derivatives). Maybe it's worth a try to implement a very simple interpreter of a very simple subset of it.,2017-06-19T12:38:48.720,1006

1321,152,0,And then you are throwing away languages which forbid multiple inheritance,2017-06-19T12:43:06.613,1006
1322,837,0,_@BenI. indeed so. Instead students could use Geogebra for example. There are great packages for symbolic math s.a. Sage or Maxyma (free ones) or Mathematica Maple (paid-for). It's hard to imagine something so extravagant in undegrad or even in graduate studies that wouldn't be covered by those.,2017-06-19T12:47:12.800,1000
1323,837,0,Unfortunately the kind of mindset which says use pen and paper pervades the offices of the ministry of education (at least where I live). Which is partly explained by incompetence and partly by conservatism. None of which are commendable qualities for educators... nevertheless instead of investing into improving the schools supplies the funds are spent elsewhere :(,2017-06-19T12:54:36.483,1000
1324,837,1,I can't say I agree with you. Computers don't necessarily make a great [cognitive match](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/) with human brains which are persistently analog. Our brains orient around spaces faces pleasures and dangers and learning is inherently social. I don't think that computers are a panacea nor that they will ever fully replace analog processes. Use them where they obviously help but be wary of falling into overly easy technologist thinking.,2017-06-19T12:59:24.947,27
1325,837,0,_@BenI. Now you resemble my wife when she claims all sorts of bad things about computer games. :) Are ruler and compass social or antisocial? Why would you even bring the subject of being social into this discussion? It is completely orthogonal to the quality of the tool. Do ruler and compass make a good cognitive match with our brain?

1327,813,2,_@terdon remember this is about teaching someone very new to programming. If you throw in too much in an example even if it's good practice you risk scaring or driving away your audience who feel it's too much to process.  This is a good start to show the power of a shell and basic commands.  Once the students have understood that later better practices will be taught.  By my experience tutoring has shown me you *can't* teach it all at once or you overwhelm those your teaching.  This is a good example of the power of a shell though I'd like to see even simpler one liners also shown.,2017-06-19T13:10:11.970,1008

1339,813,0,_@Peilonrayz well as I said I would prefer a simpler example to get the point across so I sort of agree there.  To keep with the intent of his answer I probably would start with something like delete all css files that have FIZZBAR at the start of the file name and have -tmp in the name so that something as simple as rm FIZZBAR*-tmp*.css could be used as a trivially easy example that would still be hard to do a GUI if enough files were present and a simple sorting on name would still mix in different files.  Still the *point* of the answer is good no need to nit pick his exact example,2017-06-19T16:09:31.110,1008

However it's important not to focus too much on funny failures (as is tempting to do) if your doing this to start stressing algorithms in general.  Make sure to try to act like a computer including simply failing to do anything for some invalid input (rather then doing the wrong thing).  if someone uses poor english syntax give them a syntax error.  if someone tells you something too general tell them you don't now that method/keyword try to focus on a small set of 'predefined' API calls you understand.,2017-06-19T16:24:25.690,1008

1351,813,2,*gets slightly confused as to why this comment thread has turned into Code Review*,2017-06-19T17:44:46.347,1027
1352,813,16,_@dsollen - I think the reason he is being nitpicked is that this is an educator's board and he is describing giving bad code to his students. If I was just learning command line the worst thing that I could imagine is getting a command from a teacher that didn't work for me. Let's say I was a student and I wanted to try this example on my own. I go home and try it but I have spaces in my file names. Now the code doesn't work. I may not have a good source to find out why. Now I just think CLI is finicky junk and will avoid it more in favor of GUI the exact opposite of the OP's question.,2017-06-19T17:57:18.430,1028
1353,848,0,P.S. I know that students could also run their code without IDLE. But no matter how many times I tell them to ?€?pretend to be the computer?€? and ?€?write out what your code actually computes?€? or make them do this in class experience has shown that most will not do this on the exam. I'm open to suggestions for more conceptual test questions (at the college level) or for ways to really get the weaker students to actually catch their disasterous mistakes when they only have pencil and paper.,2017-06-19T18:05:49.963,294
1354,848,0,P.P.S. we mostly hit our course goals via programming labs where students run large-scale simulations of real-world phenomena (often with some starter code). All credit to my colleagues for that course design. Unfortunately exams remain 50% of the final course grade and labs/HW don't really prepare students for them. I spend most of my in-class time on practice problems that are meant to be like exam problems but students spend most of their time in front of IDLE on HW and labs. That's what got me thinking of changing assessment to most closely match student time expenditure.,2017-06-19T18:07:24.000,294
1355,848,0,You've given me a lot to ponder here. I certainly agree wholeheartedly with the goals you've outlined but I am not sure I agree with your conclusions - among other things I don't find it difficult to discount syntactic mistakes entirely except for the occasional (very odd) edge case.,2017-06-19T18:08:31.587,27

1360,710,0,_@TobiaTesan If you decide it's acceptable then you're naturally free to allow it.  But so long as there's any amount of reference material that you don't want to allow there's a benefit to making it harder to smuggle in. As for USB ports being disabled by default that probably varies from place to place. We certainly don't do it here; we *want* students to be able to backup their work.,2017-06-19T22:27:14.430,827

1363,833,0,This is just me but if they understand the concept of vectors then you could quickly summarize how matrices are transforming vectors between systems (cartesian coordinates other coordinate systems) and how multiplying matrices together just gives you a new transformation; from there it's just a formula for multiplying matrices. So given that they know vectors I'm not sure it's a *huge* jump to that aspect of the math you describe; I don't know what the other math entails. Ben I.'s answer is probably best though =),2017-06-19T23:23:23.247,919
1365,641,1,_@BenI. $\log{n}$'s better than $\log_2{n}$.  Including the base is mathematically equivalent to including a proportionally constant which is logically inconsistent as complexity classes explicitly omit the proportionality constant.  For example both $\log_{2}{n}$ and $\log_{10}{n}$ mean the same thing in this context.  So writing $O(\log_2{n})$ instead of $O(\log{n})$ is kinda like writing $O(2n^2)$ instead of $O(n^2)$.  In both cases the extra $2$ is extraneous.,2017-06-19T23:36:19.880,39
1366,641,0,_@BenI. Just as a reference demonstrating common usage [Computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory) Wikipedia uses $\log{n}$ for this reason.  In general $\log{n}$ makes more sense whenever we're talking about arbitrary base values such as in complexity classes though the base of the log should really be included whenever we're writing in terms of numerical equality.,2017-06-19T23:42:51.077,39

1376,860,37,I'm curious why you think it'll make things more fun or what you plan to do to make things more fun.

I'm a developer not a teacher but my first thought when I looked at the examples on the Snap! page was this is actually just a text based programming language given goofy colors.  Contrast that with something like LabView which is a serious language used in serious contexts (and with a serious price tag of course).

1429,892,0,I haven't used StarLogo Nova but have extensively used NetLogo (and years ago StarLogo).  The things you liked - were they because they were drag and drop or were they due to the modelling environment which NetLogo provides with a text based language.  Just curious.,2017-06-20T23:43:20.497,237
1430,892,0,_@MikeZamansky StarLogo Nova does provide a nice modelling environment with a wide array of things you can do with it which I enjoyed - I didn't like it for being drag and drop I liked it for its usefulness.

1443,834,1,I'd echo this answer - when I was at school and looking at computer graphics (OK it was more years ago than I'd care to remember) being given the mathematical solution for 3D rotation and projection onto a 2D plane was wonderful.  It let me get on with the coding and see the results without having to struggle with the maths.  Later on I went back and worked out where the maths came from because I was one of the kids who loved the mathematics!

1445,860,0,_@CortAmmon I was sure someone would mention LabView.  That's worth taking seriously in the right context. But unless the students go on to study physics/engineering/chemistry at uni (and not every course by a long shot) they're not likely to come across it.  Even educational licenses are expensive. The graphical approach is highly polarising and doesn't lend itself to printable documented code -- we're moving more and more towards PyVisa to access an overlapping set of drivers.,2017-06-21T09:08:12.920,1127
1446,883,4,This is not a good example to showcase testing. That code had been thoroughly tested but only in an Ariane 4 context. Ariane 5 required extra tests because the conditions in which this code was called had changed but the change in conditions had not been detected as important.

1449,868,2,I feel this is too broad. HTML is code assembler is also code. Code is just that a formal language that expresses *something*. If I were an average  C++ programmer I would describe my job to my grandmother as such: *I write computer programs that is I use a specialized formal language - akin in this respect to the language of mathematics - to express the behavior I want the machine to exhibit. My understanding of what the correct behaviour should be must be sound in order for this to work.* It's all kinds of wrong technically but I feel it conveys the idea.,2017-06-21T10:18:53.750,757

1454,654,0,Thankyou for this answer.  We also don't write code in an editor the same way that we do on paper.  On paper it needs to be right or we have to scrap it and start again.  On a computer... well lets take TDD as an example shall we?  in TDD you begin by taking the simplest requirement (writing a test) writing the code to match that and then repeating until the algorithm is correct.  This involves a lot of editing but none of it is trial and error.  The editing is simple on a computer but on paper?,2017-06-21T11:11:30.683,993
1455,670,1,I agree there is a definite difference between concepts and code.  Concepts should definitely be done on paper.  It is far easier  to sketch a diagram etc than it is to answer on a computer.   For programming tests though doing it on paper is awful.,2017-06-21T11:13:03.473,993

1470,905,0,Thank you! These tools are used in the context of lab classes to gather snapshots from the student's code using one plug-in in the IDE of their choice (in my case Eclipse and all JetBrains IDEs). The code snapshots are analyzed/processed and several metrics may be used to determine the performance of the student as well as if s/he is doing plagiarism and many other things. My big question is that it seems that they are familiar in the Academia but not so much in the ?€?real world?€?. Maybe the right term is: ?€?practice assignments?€? and not ?€?training worksheets.,2017-06-21T14:04:34.283,1144

1473,812,0,You could give them a small task that they would have to complete every day. Something like creating a file with their name and current date and then upload it to a FTP server.

1474,879,0,i don't agree with: `What is a programming language?`: `it is a set of instructions`. The set of instructions is called a program and the language is a set of syntactical and grammatical rules to make sure the computer understands these instructions.,2017-06-21T14:26:24.957,1151
1475,900,2,A good programmer can write you a program with no bugs - Maybe but depending on the complexity it may be impossible to determine that. I find that telling the layperson that it is possible to produce a program with no bugs is giving a flawed impression. Perhaps this would be better: Good programmers can write you a program with few bugs. Gives a more nuanced impression about bug-checking and implies teamwork.,2017-06-21T14:29:13.047,7
1476,907,0,That's a fair point. Though we also teach 6502 assembly at my workplace and I learned ML BASIC and Pascal - they all served a pedagogic purpose at the time.  If it helps to get at an important concept then that can be reason enough.  (And keeping student engagement high enough to actually learn and explore is part of communicating the concept),2017-06-21T14:30:03.053,27
1477,905,0,Nice fix. One more thing though! (Don't feel bad - learning how to write SE questions is tricky for everyone) Are your two questions related? The standard is one query per question.  If one question really just clarifies the other then that is typically given a pass.  If that's not this you should get rid of question 2 here and open a second question from the main page for it.  (And if these two *are* super-related then the question probably needs more clarification anyway ;-),2017-06-21T14:42:36.663,27
1478,900,0,Like I said it can be hard to produce code with no bugs because computers are complicated languages are complex and applications are varied. It *is* possible to produce a program with no bugs but the difficulty of doing so grows exponentially with program scope and complexity. That's something you can explain alongside the analogy but I don't think it's necessary to muddy the waters of something that is intended to illustrate the concept to laypeople with details of how difficult this job can be.,2017-06-21T14:42:53.763,1129

1481,879,0,_@BrianH I'd agree that a program is a set of instructions. However I do think the language is also a set of instructions as it defines them - I could only think of moving the instructions to the construct of the standard library: A language is a set of syntactical and grammatical rules combined with a standard library that provides several instructions that can be used following in a program. Would this be better in your eyes?,2017-06-21T14:53:11.360,793
1482,879,0,Sounds about right i think.,2017-06-21T14:57:52.707,1151
1483,900,0,_@anaximander Ok let me nuance that further then. For a *good* programmer in most practical cases producing a program with no bugs is a practical if not theoretical impossibility. An *outstanding* programmer in *some* cases may be able to produce guaranteed bug-free code. No you shouldn't explain all this to the parents but saying Good programmers can write you a program with few bugs is not complex and will suffice to give them a more accurate impression. See [this answer and associated comments](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/195576/253910).,2017-06-21T14:59:39.623,7

1485,909,0,Kaneki do you provide one assignment per week? The thing is that in my country it is very common to have worksheets with 10-30 small assignments for the period of one week. So the performance is  measured as the number of assignments that they were able to solve corretly.  The big assignments are obviously assessed differently.,2017-06-21T15:07:01.583,1144
1486,900,1,_@called2voyage As a professional software engineer I'm painfully aware of that. All I'm saying is that for the purposes of an analogy to answer the question what is coding? I don't think it's necessary to go into that much detail. Having used this analogy to explain my job to non-technical friends and family on several occasions I do tend to go on to explain that the average computer program is so complex that it's nigh impossible to have zero bugs in anything beyond the truly trivial but I'd consider that tangential to the actual answer to the question being asked here.,2017-06-21T15:08:40.403,1129
1487,900,0,_@anaximander We'll just have to agree to disagree then. From my perspective saying A good programmer *can*... is a matter of possibility and from the lay perspective it should be seen as simply *impossible*. Any discussion of possible bug-less code should be reserved for academic discourse where terms can be more clearly defined.,2017-06-21T15:11:38.397,7
1488,911,0,Sure I agree :) My question was more to understand if educators are teaching/using it or not.,2017-06-21T15:14:08.410,1144
1489,899,6,Just as an aside. I wouldn't get bored of calculating the sum of 1 to 1 million.  It's 1000001*500000 = 500000500000 I _would_ get bored if I actually added them up.,2017-06-21T15:14:52.720,1159
1490,813,1,_@terdon I'm not much of a Bash expert but from the experience I do have I'd say it's much better to teach piping to `while` than starting with `for` loops. For one thing it's actually _easier_ to remember (just one keyword together with commands that one often uses on their own right from the command-line whereas `for` with its many pseudo-syntax bracket variants is a rather weird beast). But more importantly it's a better introduction to the general Unix spirit of using pipes for data flow whereas for-loops are more of an imperative-programming staple.,2017-06-21T15:15:55.397,1157
1491,909,0,To clarify weekly assignments are meant to be completed by first year skills within 2 hours. They are not trivial 1 function assignments but rather implementing several functions. As stated above they are purely automarked. We also give bigger assignments spanning 3-5 weeks and these are the ones we sit down with the students and review their code asking questions.,2017-06-21T15:17:08.727,747
1492,813,0,_@leftaroundabout it depends on what you are doing. Piping to while is a great way to process things line by line yes. It is not however a good way to iterate over files. I don't know what you mean by pseudo-syntax bracket variants I think you might be confusing `for` with the `test` keyword (which is an alias for `[` in POSIX shells and which in turn has been extended by the bash-specific `[[` keyword). In any case you should always use the right tool for the job and that isn't always `while`. By the way [unix.se] is a great place for this sort of question >:),2017-06-21T15:19:33.017,986

1495,813,0,_@terdon well the best tool may technically always be a custom C program that does exactly the task you need in fastest time. But clearly that's not _practical_ for most applications where shell utilities work just fine. And the combination of pipes simple fundamental commands and combinators like `while` can get you pretty far without needing to learn a lot of syntax. `for` by itself does _not_ get you very far; together with `test` in its confusing disguise it does get you much further but this isn't really something you _need_ to know to get good stuff done on the CLI.,2017-06-21T15:28:28.643,1157
1496,908,0,thesecretmaster I understand your point but that target students are different and I am not asking what could be done but if this should be done.,2017-06-21T15:32:04.107,1144
1497,813,2,_@leftaroundabout I am afraid you are paying `for` a disservice. It is fully as useful as `while` and has no odd syntax whatsoever. No more than `while`. You have probably seen it combined with `$(())` arithmetical stuff and *that* is absolutely weird syntax but has nothing to do with `for`. For example I spent years using the shell before ever learning that `while` existed and was perfectly happy with `for`. If anything it is more versatile not less.

1513,860,0,Since the students already have a programming language I don't really see the point of using visual languages to excite them about programming. If you want them to have fun programming why not do a short lesson on esoteric languages? This one is based on Arnold Schwarzenegger's one liners for instance: https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC,2017-06-21T18:03:20.950,1165
1514,864,1,_@chepner What I see as radically different is the departure from typing simple words using standard characters to using custom non-text graphical/binary items that are more difficult manage because we don't have dedicated tooling for them (like keyboards and find/replace). I do understand that there might be similarities in terms of *structure* especially after the text is parsed but I see abandoning text as quite different. I understand that in some ways this analysis supports the rest of the answer.,2017-06-21T18:13:38.943,981
1515,915,0,Nice answer. Welcome to CSE! I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-06-21T18:26:05.877,27
1516,917,0,Welcome to [cseducators.SE]! Just to be clear you are designing the curriculum for this new class that is being mandated?  Have you received a rationale or any other sort of guidance or is this just coming from left field somewhere?,2017-06-21T18:46:24.213,27
1518,918,0,It's similar in spirit (but different enough to be a different question IMHO) to this question: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/868/how-to-explain-what-code-is-to-my-parents We used [tag:layperson] there which would fit here as well. I will add it.,2017-06-21T19:00:11.147,76
1519,915,0,Piyush Parikh I deal more frequently with the traditional curriculum (I myself never learned unit testing in the University). But fully understand the advantages of using unit tests. The thing is that even in zero to job-ready courses using Java I don't see the teachers using unit testing. Maybe it is a cultural issue...,2017-06-21T19:19:01.817,1144
1520,920,1,That is a very relevant research paper.  Nice find!  In order to make this the best answer it can be (and in case the link one day goes dead) could you summarize the most important takeaways?,2017-06-21T19:44:56.610,27
1521,868,3,*Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is* @Aurora0001 is this you?,2017-06-21T20:50:22.463,1178
1522,864,1,_@jpmc26 considering that assembly is a radical departure from the underlying machine code (you can read it now!) and C is a radical departure from the ~1:1 of assembly to machine code and Haskell is a radical departure... etc. I would say this supports Neal's arguments *more* not less. ...are more difficult to manage because we don't have dedicated tooling for them... is generally what managers say to resist switching to new paradigms. The real question to potentially bring up is Is this abstraction of programming particularly useful? If so for what classes of tasks?,2017-06-21T20:54:17.377,1177
1523,925,0,Regarding the little apology I just ripped out of your answer no need to apologize. We're glad you found us :),2017-06-21T21:15:20.397,27
1524,864,0,_@Blackhawk I hope it is clear that I am not objecting to the answer as a whole merely to the notion that controlling indentation is not merely a small step away from what block programming languages do.,2017-06-21T21:22:53.417,981
1525,908,1,Not everyone knows that CS1 means the intro course for college majors. You might want to make that explicit.,2017-06-21T21:25:08.417,283
1526,923,0,Mike you kind of answered the question that I should have done! :) In introductory classes you can provide the tests as part of the assignments. This is one approach that I've seen previously!,2017-06-21T21:33:50.263,1144
1527,926,0,Welcome to CSE! I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-06-21T21:37:55.770,27
1528,925,0,_@BenI. Cheers. I usually figure the kind of people who care about the apology will be angry about not getting one but the kind of people who don't care won't mind seeing one (or quietly editing it out).,2017-06-21T21:37:59.270,1166

1533,900,0,_@called2voyage A good programmer *can* write a (complex) program with no bugs.  Whether there exist any good programmers remains an open question.,2017-06-21T23:25:08.607,827
1534,900,0,_@Ray That's an overly restrictive definition of good for my tastes.,2017-06-21T23:32:21.817,7
1535,860,0,*Why* do you want to teach it?  If we knew we could help you explain that to the kids.  But it seems like you?€?re looking for justification yourself.  After taking a quick look my quextion is ?€?why can't I just type that??€?  you need a good answer as that?€?s what the kids will wonder too.,2017-06-21T23:48:03.093,1116
1536,421,0,To me this is less broad and more unclear what you're asking. How do you define the two groups? What sort of demographic/age/etc are *your* students at? Etcetera. It's hard to compare/contrast with poor definitions.,2017-06-22T00:08:40.083,919
1537,860,0,Why even argue the point? Call your exercises 'puzzles' or 'logic puzzles'. Allow your students to go off-script and use that tool to do things that you didn't ask them to (or that they didn't imagine they could even do themselves with it). If by the end of the course your students tell you that Snap is not a puzzle-building environment as much as it is a programming language you can actually build stuff with then I suppose you will have completed at least one of your teaching objectives.,2017-06-22T00:36:13.540,1195
1538,390,1,I like to use the example of Square inheriting from Rectangle vs inheriting from Shape.  What happens to a Square (with a given Side length) if you set Width different from Height?  After working it out it shows that inheritance should have one responsibility - to fit the base interface Shape.  It doesn't always make sense for types to derive from each other.  Think Liskov Substitution Principle.,2017-06-22T00:39:29.163,1196
1539,918,0,_@PiyushParikh Feel free to roll back the title - I'm just trying to massage the question to be more on-topic but you don't have to accept any changes you disagree with. (To roll back just click where it says I edited the question and you will see the edit and have the ability to roll back if you choose),2017-06-22T01:55:09.517,27
1540,934,0,Welcome to CSE! RF is indeed amazing. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-06-22T01:56:58.130,27

1542,868,1,Ones and zeroes,2017-06-22T04:33:02.423,730
1544,917,0,_@BenI. It is being mandated and I have been  asked to advise on the curriculum.  I also just find the question interesting.  The rationale is not spelled out very clearly but I think it goes like this. Students will do projects in their degree many of which will involve testing some hypothesis (e.g. does my computer vision/ML system detect the sharks well does my new robot control work better than the old one etc) or at the very least evaluation of some user feedback of their software.    In general many CS jobs are data heavy these days and stats is a core data analysis discipline.,2017-06-22T06:18:52.547,1168
1545,824,0,_(reposting)_ Some more examples of fun tasks: Copy files from a directory to another from a list (see my script [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41122601/3258851)) concatenate two mp4 files without re-encoding (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/7333232/3258851)) causing the watchdog timer to reboot the system (see [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/372376/154671)) watching Star Wars IV: A New Hope from Telnet (address: towel.blinkenlights.nl) etc.,2017-06-22T06:22:09.417,1206
1547,891,0,Knitting recipies may be an even better analogy.  The result is much more well-defined even though you have different sizes.  Also they _resemble_ code.,2017-06-22T07:23:49.573,1213
1550,867,0,_@BenI. i tried to flesh it out some more,2017-06-22T08:46:53.703,1064
1552,918,0,Title might be better comparing CS to coding. Maybe 'the science part of CS'.,2017-06-22T09:39:39.643,41
1553,919,0,Rather than 'never gets dated' a lot of it becomes more widely relevant as hardware improvements reduce the compute cost (so it's not all abstract).,2017-06-22T09:45:47.713,41
1554,917,1,I can't be much help with course design but I did the 'standard' first year statistics class in the Mathematics department as part of my CS degree and have found it hugely useful over the years since. So I think it's a good idea to mandate for CS and probably for all science degrees. I don't think it's necessary to tailor the class just for CS; a broad introduction to stats generally will be helpful. The areas of stats that will/won't be useful will depend highly on what field students end up in and it's hard to foresee that in year 1 of a degree.,2017-06-22T09:46:45.913,57
1555,128,0,If *any mistakes in the markup will be visible when you load the page* then you must be using a custom browser because most of them go out of their way not to cover up mistakes in the markup.,2017-06-22T10:08:59.383,1219
1556,948,1,Hi Checkersquares welcome to CS Educators! I'd just like to warn you that this question might spark some discussion because it's not explicitly about teaching computer science it's about getting someone interested in learning. I personally like this question because motivating students is certainly a part of teaching.,2017-06-22T10:11:03.327,58
1557,258,0,There is an editor called [Pollo](http://pollo.sourceforge.net/) which has a similar aesthetic but is actually designed to edit XML. In addition you can give it a schema and it will enforce it which makes it useful for teaching the structure of a real document. I have actually used this with a custom schema for a configuration file which was essentially a basic programming language to teach someone who knew nothing of programming how to create config files without having to worry about syntax errors.,2017-06-22T10:13:20.330,1219
1558,945,0,While this is certainly an interesting take on how to teach OO it isn't an analogy and so doesn't exactly answer the question. I think that it brings value to the question anyways so +1.,2017-06-22T10:14:11.317,58
1559,945,0,_@thesecretmaster I do consider it an analogy. Just that the analogy is behavior. And how best to encode behavior than with code?,2017-06-22T10:33:14.080,1214
1560,919,5,One thing I emphasize with my students once they're up to algorithms is that faster hardware and bigger hard drives make a lot of things *worse* instead of better. An $n^2$ algorithm on a faster computer is not really faster if the availability of more data tempts you into a larger $n$.,2017-06-22T10:38:22.287,27
1561,948,0,_@thesecretmaster Yeah I can see what you mean. From the SE sites I know it felt like the most appropriate but it's probably a bit pre-education  and focuses more on a single person than a classroom (though I believe there's benefit in a more personalized education). If it gets flagged as off-topic I'll take it down.,2017-06-22T10:58:12.503,1216
1562,891,0,I very often use the 'recipe' analogy so 1+ for that. But for a real-world demo show them Robo Rally ([board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally)) or Chip Wits (brilliant ancient Mac game [modern remake](http://www.chipwits.com/)) or Lego [Mindstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms).,2017-06-22T11:09:29.460,1220
1564,891,0,The recipe and cookbook analogies are such great ways to deliver the idea of coding to people who don't know much code that Chef ruby is based around them: https://docs.chef.io/ruby.html These ideas have proven to sell - they're worth a lot in term of business impact (and money of course).,2017-06-22T12:28:21.990,1224
1565,891,0,You'll also have to convince your parents that computers are dumb machines which *have* to be told what to do. A lot of people will think of computers in terms of the function they provide.,2017-06-22T13:08:05.013,1164
1566,927,1,Ghost students are those that you know that exist but have never actually seen them on classes... :),2017-06-22T13:26:25.670,1144
1567,931,2,Ben I understand what you have said. The main problem is that this specific class is not optional. To graduate they will have to pass one day.  A few minutes ago I had a code review with one of those students (in a server-side dev class using PHP). The student is entirely unable to understand even the smaller concepts. He has just made a couple of Inserts on a few tables but even that code was provided by me in the classes a few years ago. My question is: should you tell a student that s/he is not fitted for this and s/he is just spending money? :(,2017-06-22T13:34:24.720,1144
1568,950,0,I just had a *why didn't I think of that???* moment. I love any activity that gets the kids out of their chairs. Wonderful!,2017-06-22T13:51:07.970,27
1569,935,0,Welcome to CSE. I just went through your answers thus far and I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-06-22T13:52:20.040,27
1570,952,7,Why not both? Give them group project with full code-review and proper testing.,2017-06-22T14:16:36.097,685
1572,962,1,Wow what kind of test could you even write for Hello World? You're probably right but that's not the problem I'm describing. I'm talking about half-semester type projects done for real-world customers. Not exactly paycheck-worthy but still full-fledged functioning web services deployed to real servers and everything solving a small need for someone in the community.,2017-06-22T14:55:20.123,1166
1573,952,3,Introduce them to TDD early.  It's good for both breaking down tasks to develop algorithms and for producing quality code in the first place.  Not to mention that it's a very good habit to have.,2017-06-22T14:55:39.360,993
1574,962,0,`assert Hello World == hello_world_method` I didn't realize the size of the projects being done. Would you mind editing that into the question?,2017-06-22T14:56:39.190,58
1575,952,0,Maybe write code pass it to your neighbour and have them debug it.,2017-06-22T14:58:01.870,1234
1576,962,0,IMO TDD isn't appropriate for bootstrapping a project. It's most useful for bug fixes: create a test that replicates the bug make sure the test fails as expected then fix the test.,2017-06-22T15:04:11.250,65
1577,962,0,I made an attempt at editing but I'm not sure what to change. The question really applies regardless of project size setting aside the fact for the moment that TDD/BDD aren't appropriate for tiny projects. Beyond that I think the existing handful of weeks covers it.,2017-06-22T15:07:02.503,1166
1578,962,0,_@G.Ann-SonarSourceTeam TDD is the process of writing failing tests making the tests pass and repeating until the project is complete.,2017-06-22T15:07:20.613,58
1579,963,0,Hi John! Welcome to CS Educators! As it currently stands I don't really see anything different between your answer and the one given by @BrettBecker. Would you mind elaborating so that the difference becomes clear?,2017-06-22T15:23:23.470,58
1580,963,1,If you look at it from a perspective of teaching debugging to someone who has zero knowledge on the subject though targeted debugging exercises written by an instructor can focus on specific skills and strategies in a far more structured fashion than simply relying on whatever luck-of-the-draw situation comes from student-generated code.  By all means this shouldn't be an either-or proposition.  Both skills are critical.,2017-06-22T15:23:35.653,1235
1581,965,1,Hi Tom! Welcome to CS Educators! This is a really great first answer thanks for writing it up!,2017-06-22T15:24:42.830,58
1582,931,0,I don't believe there are people who can't get the first couple of CS courses. That being said some people take longer to get it and some require different ways of having things explained to them.,2017-06-22T15:48:27.593,541
1583,931,1,_@NunoGilFonseca I agree with Alfred Thompson. If the course is required then it falls onto the instructor to create a path that the student can follow in order to be successful. That path does not have to involve relaxing the standards they have to meet and it can be difficult but it must *exist*. Give them a *reasonable* list of resources and hoops (ie. not read these 3 books) and just make the standards and your recommendations for how to meet them know.  It is our job to help the students get to where they need to be *from where they are* not from where we wish they were.,2017-06-22T15:54:07.333,27
1584,962,0,Yeah I get that @thesecretmaster.,2017-06-22T15:59:45.823,65
1585,341,1,I use the you can play games you write yourself as well. Sometimes the kids actually do write a game and play it. Then I tell them to make the game better. :-),2017-06-22T16:02:16.540,541
1586,891,1,I like and use the recipe analogy a lot but I usually add the caveat that a program is a recipe written for an entity that cannot think for itself.  A standard recipe will just say something like add 2 cups of flour.  However there's a lot of assumed knowledge there that a computer program has to include explicitly.  Where does the flour come from?  What should be used to bring it over to the bowl?  What if there's not enough?  What if it spills?,2017-06-22T16:48:54.553,1243

1592,695,0,See also: [Code Golf SE](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/). While I don't expect students to start golfing their code (<shudder>) the sorts of challenges that come up are the ones that are generally good to present. Particularly the ones tagged [kolmogorov-complexity] which is all about expressing something complex as a series of simpler instructions. Algorithms are for finding short cuts by doing the same operation multiple times instead of copy-pasting and why I don't like most of the other answers.,2017-06-22T18:04:31.023,1244
1593,707,0,I'd add the caveat that if the assignment is to write code that does X they can't go acquire code that does X for them. E.g. if the assignment is to write a bubble sort function they shouldn't be hitting up Stack Overflow for bubble sort [language]. If a section of the assignment can be completed by utilizing code written earlier in the semester then getting that segment off SO is fine too (I certainly can't write a merge sort algorithm from scratch but I need one for project Y so why not grab it from somewhere else?).,2017-06-22T18:15:42.590,1244

1604,952,0,What age group?

1610,400,0,One thing I learned when stepping into the work field is that there is no best practices there are only agreements between the team. I don't think your personal opinion should impact a student's grade.,2017-06-22T21:32:11.903,1255

1613,980,0,Nice insights from seasoned developer. Welcome to CSE!,2017-06-22T22:04:21.437,27
1614,979,0,We don't get a ton of time to cover debugging. Partly because they will *have* to pick this up later so we try to focus in on the things that will be harder to pick up naturally. Nice answer welcome to CSE!,2017-06-22T22:05:56.403,27
1616,981,0,Welcome to CSeducators Stack Exchange! `unittest`  it Python specific and if the class if based on Python this could be a good project. Could the same project concept be developed to apply to any language?,2017-06-22T22:28:43.960,104
1617,978,0,Our first real Computer Science Problem: How do you change base representations of numbers. Here is a big fat place to introduce mod (%).,2017-06-22T22:49:23.217,21
1619,985,4,Strongly disagree. Digital logic is designed at a higher level of abstraction than this. Yes eventually the mapping to bits is relevant but datapath is mostly '+' and '-' functions. Logic yes. Binary not so much.,2017-06-22T23:16:37.340,41
1620,973,2,There is a big difference between teaching it mentioning it in passing or using it as an example when teaching hex. You could just as usefully teach hex as having a 4 bit mapping for each digit and that would be closer to what designers use most of the time.,2017-06-22T23:23:42.667,41
1621,539,0,TBH logic/control should come first - but in order to see it happen and make sure it works you need the I/O too (well at least the O),2017-06-22T23:43:45.020,662
1625,977,2,Re 1 means on 0 means off.  If you're using bits as BInary digiTS then 1 means 1x2^n where n is the bit position and 0 means 0.  If you're using them for any other purpose in software then 1 and 0 mean whatever the developer wants them to mean.  If you're using them to control hardware then 1 and 0 mean whatever was convenient for the hardware designer.  (Back in the days of TTL logic 0 often meant on and 1 off.),2017-06-23T03:31:05.987,1269
1626,952,0,what makes you believe that any practical application can actually be error free?,2017-06-23T03:36:05.520,1270
1627,973,5,If you don't understand binary you're going to have a hard time with bitmapped flags--and high level languages do have bitmapped flags.,2017-06-23T04:26:53.673,668
1628,860,0,Other real world examples of DnD are SQL Server Integration Services (SISS) and BizTalk. MS Visual Studio includes DnD to create the user interface.,2017-06-23T05:09:21.473,146
1630,976,2,I came to this HNQ to find an answer like that. In the industry you often have contexts where it is 90% debugging and rewriting existing code and only 10% writing your own. So from the real world perspective debugging existing code usually written by others is much more prevalent than writing from scratch but being very good at writing from scratch of course provides the knowledge and capability to know how the debugged code should look like what's wrong with it.,2017-06-23T06:39:13.930,1274
1631,891,0,A computer is just a very fast electronic idiot,2017-06-23T06:45:44.560,1275
1632,973,9,Wait you mean they haven't been taught number representations in high school? I'm truly shocked.,2017-06-23T06:50:22.940,945
1633,985,2,_@SeanHoulihane - boolean logic is literally about binary states.,2017-06-23T08:44:25.497,1145
1634,985,4,_@Davor yes as in 2 state logic (or sometimes 4). Nothing to do with power of 2 number systems.,2017-06-23T09:03:03.377,41
1635,973,3,_@LorenPechtel your comment made me realize I haven't manually built a binary bitmapped flag in **years** (actually since my 2nd college year). Nowadays most popular functions use constants that you can OR together e.g. [PHP's json_encode](http://php.net/manual/es/function.json-encode.php). We are so spoiled!,2017-06-23T09:51:20.440,994
1637,981,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I don't see why this should be restricted to any language.,2017-06-23T12:18:39.503,1256
1639,989,7,I feel like the tone here says students will be completely lost without understanding binary which is hyperbole. It's a pretty easy thing to learn at any point. But I do agree that it's much easier to understand later CS concepts with a good grasp on binary. I recall several projects in C that would have been much easier if I understood bits and bitwise operators and how to use them.,2017-06-23T13:14:19.907,1286
1640,989,2,_@ChrisSchneider I'm trying to think of a single CS concept that isn't rooted in or directly related to discrete elements Boolean logic or binary.  What would you *teach* of CS to students who didn't know these things?  I'm really wondering.,2017-06-23T13:24:47.347,1103
1641,989,7,Boolean can be understood quite easily without understanding binary or even knowing it exists. True and false are real world concepts not exclusive to CS and kids learn about `>` `<` `==` in 2nd or 3rd grade. I mean that _is_ still binary just not taught as a CS concept.,2017-06-23T13:36:03.063,1286
1642,977,0,Ah sorry my answer isn't completely clear there. I'll figure out how best to update that. Thanks!,2017-06-23T13:52:08.067,1099
1643,952,2,In my opinion it's not so much about the debugging (they'll do that anyhow on their own applications as well although certainly it's different) but just the simple act of **reading other people's code**. In my opinion that's taught way too little if at all in university but it is oh so very very very essential.,2017-06-23T14:01:58.863,819

1647,993,0,Thanks for the answer it's been a very insightful read. I got sad at the please don't accept a 30% failure rate as the norm or even as acceptable part though because that was the absolutely very best we've managed to do. College is free here and students often leave our program in the middle of the term to prospect other fields.,2017-06-23T15:18:24.193,78

1650,339,0,Haha in my experience lack of an internet connection can greatly enhance the learning experience on-computer. Especially with high-schoolers.,2017-06-23T16:04:06.073,1290
1652,993,0,Take what I say with a grain of salt then because I am in such a different context. If the consequences of failure are not catastrophic then perhaps that 30% is much more reasonable. Do kids leaving mid-range to prospect elsewhere count as failures?,2017-06-23T16:30:43.410,27
1653,92,0,*`and are thought to be of little value now`* Depends on who you ask. They're still quite common. (And in some respects I'm not very good *at* them even though I'm a rather proficient coder).,2017-06-23T16:34:30.817,1244

1656,989,1,how do you know OP is teaching computer scientists? It could just be an introductory programming course in which case I would *not* expect binary to be taught. It's absolutely not required.,2017-06-23T16:47:57.020,869
1657,973,1,I teach high school so was thinking about that. But really the first CS course at any grade level is fairly similar in scope and sequence if you assume not previous knowledge.,2017-06-23T16:50:35.887,541
1658,92,0,Not necessarily there either. People can refuse because *they know that the measure of the test is pointless* or they might refuse because *they know that they aren't any good at programming.*  In either case the result is equivalent to This scores Banana out of Ten.,2017-06-23T16:51:01.813,1244

1663,1003,0,Hi Geoff! Welcome to [cseducators.se]!  Thanks for choosing to contribute your knowledge here. Would you mind fleshing out your answer a bit more? It's already good as is but that might make it a bit better.,2017-06-23T17:23:07.130,58
1664,982,1,Good point @AlfredThompson. I teach at a women's college where the students are more mature than high schoolers.,2017-06-23T17:54:33.690,283
1666,973,1,If you don't teach them binary how are you going to teach them that 5 * 0.2 != 1.0?,2017-06-23T18:37:26.903,1301
1669,952,1,Incidentally as someone who's done both CS and French teaching-related work I think there's an analogy with Should I have students write their own French or edit and translate others'? The answer is simply **yes** :) The more methods you can throw at a student for interacting with the material the better it will stick and also the more likely they'll discover what they love most. Similarly in the CS courses I was helping with there were lectures guided labs unguided labs larger assignments tiny Q&As  mutual code reviews puzzles etc. ?€? every possible tool. I thought it was great.,2017-06-23T19:33:38.557,927
1670,1013,1,Hi Jeffery! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a good answer and we hope to hear more from you in the future. I like your use of an example conversation.,2017-06-23T20:42:50.633,58
1671,1010,1,Hi Luizfzs! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Don't worry about not being a salaried teacher -- I'm not either.

This is an interesting take on the question and I hope to hear more from you!,2017-06-23T20:53:27.260,58
1673,973,0,What exactly is learning Binary? Knowing that computers work with a binary system or being able to read and maybe calculate with binary numbers?,2017-06-23T22:04:45.757,653

1675,984,0,Thanks! This happened to me as a student in a CS 2020 class probably this is most effective at a specific level of complexity.,2017-06-23T23:31:49.843,1172
1677,917,0,What level of statistics?  Often times the basic intro to stats class (STA2023 when I took it) is required for a STEM related AA degree or if skipping the AA then as a pre-req before entering the college the CompSci department is part of (I know ufl.edu works this way - CISE is part of the College of Engineering and any type of engineering has the basic stats as a pre-req for admittance along with 2 terms each of chemistry and physics and math through calc2 w/ diff eq.).,2017-06-24T00:12:50.733,662
1678,982,1,This is unwise.  Ironically the more high-level the language the more likely the bite of the unanticipated sign bit will be severe.  Good luck to the binary-ignorant Java programmer who needs to place multi-byte values in a stream of data.,2017-06-24T00:46:13.577,1308
1679,402,1,I like to show the same program - say a simple game like BlackJack or HangMan - done really really poorly and done right.

It brings a whole new dimension to the vi vs. emacs debate...,2017-06-24T00:55:08.930,662
1682,982,3,_@ChrisStratton Whether programmers should know binary is a different question than whether they should learn it freshman year. Big-O notation is important but students typically don't learn that until their second year of college CS.,2017-06-24T00:57:53.743,283
1683,982,3,Big-O notation is far less important.  First the notation itself does nothing; it's the concepts it expresses - you can have perfectly fine conversations about efficient computation without involving it at all.  But even then ignorance of algorithmic efficiency may get you *slow* code; but ignorance of numeric formats yields *broken* code.,2017-06-24T01:03:51.513,1308

1700,1030,4,Compiled and interpreted are properties of implementations. CPython inteprets Python but it first compiles Python to bytecode before actually interpreting it. PyPy compiles Python using JIT. Jython compiles Python to JVM bytecode as does javac. As for Java the Java bytecode needs to be eventually intetpreted but there are implementations like gcj which compile Java to native code. Conclusion: don't complicate things; the bigger difference is that Python is dynamically typed while Java is statically typed.,2017-06-24T08:44:20.213,130

1721,973,0,_@J??rgWMittag Oddly very little emphasis is placed on this is math classes in American public schools in my experience. When I entered my first year of college as a Computer Science major I was shocked by how many of even the best students had no idea what a number base was. After I transferred into public school during high school each year I ended up teaching fellow students about number bases before mathematics competitions because they weren't taught in any of the classes. And again these were the students who were participating in mathematics contests not just average students.,2017-06-24T18:29:18.927,1319

1726,1050,0,Your mileage with this technique may vary depending on your student population. I recall a blog post by a professor who had switched universities and lamented that his ratemyprofessor comments completely changed in nature.

1729,1044,3,I wouldn't say Master's degree level. Though some variation between schools can be expected I got a decent introduction to CS theory (NFA DFA regular languages Turing completeness and I forget what else) at the third-year undergraduate level. And that was at a school that's known for agriculture not computer science. Likewise with AI - you can often find at least introductory courses on the subject at the undergrad level.,2017-06-24T22:19:33.313,1248
1730,1046,0,What do they have difficulty with? Is it the syntax? Things like comprehensions?  Maybe certain toolkits?  Can you provide more details or examples of things they have problems with?,2017-06-24T22:22:04.443,1292
1732,952,0,I am currently experimenting with getting pupils to modify existing code ?€? I have not been teaching long but believe that this will have a better outcome that having struggle to start from zero.,2017-06-24T23:53:01.757,204
1733,1077,3,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! We're glad to have you here. Could you give an example of such a project in your answer?,2017-06-25T02:10:22.510,27
1736,982,0,The idea that binary is not needed when programming in high-level languages is not just utterly wrong but dangerous. It leads to ideas like thinking floating point numbers are real numbers.,2017-06-25T03:01:50.740,1327
1739,1037,2,Are you sure they're between 17 and 19? In our college(VNIT) those courses are taught at the UG level to third year CS students which means the students learning those are between 20 and 22.,2017-06-25T03:55:58.610,1328
1740,1044,0,In my BS CS I needed 1 year (two classes) of discrete math.  Regular languahes grammars etc. had one semester.  The textbook had pumping lemmings on the cover.  At the time Computer Science meant *science* ?€? theory. There was only a little programming.,2017-06-25T04:29:25.713,1116
1748,1038,10,#2. Tasking them to code a tiny (programming language) tokenizer/parser or an evaluator for expressions encoded in strings (-1+2/3) is a nice problem with quite simple solution when knowing the tools of the trade (a.k.a theory)... but excruciating and bug-prone when skipping it. There's nothing more practical than a good theory ;),2017-06-25T08:13:50.860,1332
1749,1080,1,Personally I don't believe in fear as an adequate motivator... you will always meet persons who (a) think they are smarter and (b) some that actually are. There are more components than those two. May I remind we as a society have both got laws and punishment but nevertheless we *still* have need for good door locks!,2017-06-25T08:24:58.287,1332
1750,1083,0,Isn't this a perfect example though? The door itself is a security feature.  Left unlocked it is poorly implemented and yet it is still unethical to intrude upon the system.,2017-06-25T08:27:25.200,27
1752,1083,0,I wouldn't say it's a security feature not even a poorly implemented one. Think of a camping site with tents... *privacy* as part of a hopefully binding social contract is the limit to our actions not the poorly implemented security of the tent flap. There is no security in a tent flap at all :),2017-06-25T08:32:51.140,1332
1753,1085,1,Welcome to Computer Science Educators! This is a very clever distinction. I sure hope we'll be hearing more from you.,2017-06-25T09:10:27.460,150
1754,1080,1,Anonymity has nothing to do with ethics. This is legal stuff: you get caught you go to prison: ethics are irrelevant. However when talking about ethics you act ethically or unethically independently of the fact of being caught and sent to prison. If I'm 100% sure that hacking your PC won't get me to prison I still won't do it because this is against *my* ethics.,2017-06-25T09:13:14.543,1334
1755,1079,0,The door analogy is very nice but a bit flawed. It might be good to talk about the difference between security and privacy. I'd also make clear that some security is enforced via technology (those are the ones the course is about) but there are other ways to bring you security such as laws. So even if a specific measure turns out not to be technically effective it might still be illegal to disregard it. So apart from ethics which are hard to teach you could also focus on what is lawful.,2017-06-25T09:39:45.070,1336
1756,1085,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se] Arseni! I know @ItamarGreen already welcomed you but I wanted to add that your answer is excellent very well thought out and was interesting to read. I hope that I'll see you around the site writing more excellent Q&A!,2017-06-25T09:56:52.953,58
1758,1079,0,Why not expand on justice and rigorous / formulaic approach to the subject? After all it is not unique to hacking. Many programs that work with humans must incorporate the concept of justice s.a. bandwidth distribution to the networking entities elevators transporting people traffic lights and so on. I also don't believe in ultimate statements like the one implying that breaking into other computers is always morally reprehensible. Trivial examples are good to motivate thinking but ultimately students should make their own decisions.,2017-06-25T11:24:08.847,1000
1759,1086,0,Hi Pascal! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a really useful answer well fleshed out and informative. I hope to see you around the site more!,2017-06-25T11:43:43.697,58
1760,948,0,I think this could be on-topic if it's re-written to be less specific and more about diversity. The 'elite' perception is a valid concern - and although we'd prefer our junior coders to all be high-fliers that would leave noone to do the implementation work or testing,2017-06-25T12:09:55.240,41
1762,1079,0,Realistically the legal aspects are just as important as the ethical ones. Locks are also different - almost all all vunerable whilst secure software may be fairly secure.,2017-06-25T12:30:57.557,41
1763,1074,2,I like having concurrency spread over the whole curriculum as a concept I think that makes a lot of sense and that's how we do it in high school level CS too. I love the leverage impatience approach too. But I'm not so sure about the first paragraph as a general statement (introduce concurrency early to not lock students into a sequential mindset) because getting concurrency right is hard - much harder than sequential thinking - and I don't think getting used to sequential solutions first actually makes later introduction of concurrency more difficult.,2017-06-25T12:34:48.277,1336
1764,1087,0,I can't say I agree with you here but your comment is well written and thoughtful. Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-06-25T13:35:07.757,27
1766,1079,3,I'd suggest you teach how black hat hackers are punished but Robert T Morris turned out pretty well off.,2017-06-25T13:55:57.573,283
1767,982,1,_@R.. Good point. If you read my full answer you'll see that I mention learning it later in the curriculum just not in the first year. I'll qualify my second sentence.,2017-06-25T14:04:10.233,283
1768,1079,1,Please compare [cracker](http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html) and [hacker](http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html).,2017-06-25T16:01:16.683,1344
1769,1085,1,This is an interesting one. Whilst I do agree with you that trying an SQLi isn't ethically wrong (and I think you did the right thing) it's probably *not lawful* and this could do with being mentioned in the context of a class on security.,2017-06-25T16:39:57.263,916
1771,1035,1,I wish I'd been exposed to the mechanics of programming languages earlier - I think I'd have really benefitted from something like this. It's only when I started looking at reverse engineering that I began to look at how the JVM worked how I could disassemble code etc.,2017-06-25T17:02:54.460,916
1772,992,0,_@thesecretmaster Thanks! I must confess I've committed just so I could discuss this question it's been haunting me for quite a while.,2017-06-25T17:27:30.863,78
1773,1092,4,Depends if you are grading programming ability or ability to guess what you are thinking.,2017-06-25T17:31:51.993,204
1774,1079,0,I would just keep the focus on ?€?we learn how to break in so that we know how to keep others out.?€?,2017-06-25T17:37:36.327,204
1775,993,0,Yes they do but failing and leaving are often correlated. Students who pass CS101 and CS201 will hardly leave and when they do they'll pick a major where their credits can be used such as math or stats. Reading the 2006 article had sort of brought me a bit of peace of mind (after all _not everyone could learn so it was out of our reach anyway_) but the retraction made me worry our mindset might be a lot more pernicious than I had previously expected.,2017-06-25T17:41:22.863,78
1776,1083,0,I am not 100% sure in what situations it is unethical to intrude but it seems always unethical to take a copy of private information or to destroy or damage anything. (I have avoided the work theft as this applies to physical goods where when you take it it is no longer where it was. This has two very different affects: they no longer have it. You have it. With information then only one way apply and they are very different concepts.),2017-06-25T17:44:26.787,204
1777,1020,0,Thanks for the answer. So do you have some collaborative material you could share with us? Also I didn't understand your instance on sharing past grades with new students could you please clarify?,2017-06-25T17:57:32.660,78
1778,1095,0,That seems plum crazy to me: It's one of a few things that has frustrated me with my department..,2017-06-25T18:25:49.010,916
1779,1097,5,I really like this solution seems like a great way to encourage students to think outside the box and write tests for situations that you may not have thought of initially.,2017-06-25T18:26:20.693,916
1780,973,0,The question is ?€?is it a pre-requisite to teaching another part of the syllabus?€?,2017-06-25T18:28:51.940,204
1782,1096,0,Not sure how I feel about the secret time complexity testing. I'd be okay with it if the spec explicitly asked for the most time-efficient algorithm to be implemented but there's often a trade-off between space-complexity time-complexity and hell .. readability. Should students be penalised for prioritising the wrong thing there?,2017-06-25T18:29:27.547,916
1784,973,0,There are 10 types of people in the world: those that know binary and those that don't.,2017-06-25T18:30:04.593,204
1785,1096,0,_@AdamWilliams yes specify big-O in the question. Unless it in implicit e.g. implement quick sort. And while I would always say optimise for readability I would also say that minimising complexity is making it more readable. Having a loop within a loop when one loop will do is not cool but having a loop follow a loop is ok. Having more code that me in the loop is also ok. Though we could ask could that be moved out of the loop it would not fail a big-O test.,2017-06-25T18:38:47.837,204
1786,1092,3,In introductory courses at the U of Toronto they generally incorporate a few key cases as examples in the assignment spec and warn students that these aren't exhaustive ?€? and then none are added that test behaviour not explicitly described in the spec. And as @EllenSpertus says below from the first course up there are assignments requiring test-*writing* too.,2017-06-25T19:06:57.900,927
1787,1092,0,But I will certainly say that not all the tests in the suites I've written were given to students. As long as they're still learning their motivation is often a grade rather than a good product so it becomes too tempting to code to the tests including hard-coding input???output irresponsible as it might seem. An example is a Sudoku fast-fail algorithm they needed to write. Seeing all our test cases would have resulted in uncommonly fast fails...,2017-06-25T19:09:38.163,927
1788,1092,2,Isn't the problem of writing a test case map eliminated when instructors actually glance at the code? I'm not sure this justifies not releasing test cases nor would I appreciate it if my grade was entirely determined by automated tests.,2017-06-25T19:10:53.820,916
1789,1102,2,?€?If your students can understand why $1/3 = 0.\dot 3$?€? ?€???that's actually a difficult one. I expect that most students don't really understand it.,2017-06-25T20:34:35.650,124
1790,1101,1,I love this practice. It does require a fair amount of organization. I will try this on a unit in the fall and see how it goes.,2017-06-25T20:56:51.273,27
1791,1105,0,I'm not sure how this question will fare given that resource requests are usually frowned up on Stack Exchange.,2017-06-25T20:57:03.837,58
1792,1105,1,_@thesecretmaster not really - on Physics.SE for example they are welcomed - it varies on the site. I thought [this meta thread's consensus](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112/are-resource-requests-on-topic) was in favor of allowing resource recommendations.,2017-06-25T20:59:03.500,919
1793,1105,0,As a note [self-teaching](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/q/23/166) is on-topic here so it's probably fine to frame the question in that regard.,2017-06-25T21:02:31.390,166
1794,1096,0,You should not be testing to see if they can guess the test cases. But you **should** be testing to see if they can write correct programs. Not penalizing them for not deriving their own test cases amounts to not penalizing them for not dong the work properly - unless the objective of the course is to produce graduates who can't manage fizzbuzz type questions in job interviews!,2017-06-25T21:09:20.430,1352
1795,1092,1,Releasing some *simple* test cases is a very good way for the students to check they understand what they are required to do. On the other hand not releasing *all* the test cases used until after grading seems almost essential otherwise the smart students will just code to the test rather than actually solve the problem assigned. That may get them good marks for the course but it won't make them good real-world programmers!,2017-06-25T21:13:00.400,1352
1797,1105,1,By starting writing code in it what sort of code do you mean? Back-end Ruby using a framework like Rails? By familiar with Python do you mean familiar with OOP or just general syntax/logic? I have a couple resources in mind one of which is a) at a university level and b) part of a more theoretical study of programming languages. What is the intent of learning Ruby? Fun? Web development? Clarify this information and you will get better resources.,2017-06-25T21:15:32.453,76
1798,1106,6,Just use self-teaching and phrase it for yourself then. There's no need to word around that :),2017-06-25T21:24:16.467,27
1799,1106,2,The question is very opinion based. This is simply a matter of which open source project you like best with welcoming as the only criterion. This question invites discussion because there is no real answer.  As stated in the close reason: Answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions rather than facts references or specific expertise.,2017-06-25T21:30:43.620,58

1802,1106,1,We also may have an expertise issue: CS educators are not _de facto_ experts in open source. As such we might not be the best community for providing quality answers for this topic.,2017-06-25T21:45:25.787,76

1808,1106,0,Our sites community is teachers. Often teachers are not experts in open source and often are not even involved in open source. I'd say that we don't have experts because many teachers don't participate in open source and it's not relevant to the community because teachers are not normally required to discuss open source projects.,2017-06-25T23:30:44.323,58
1810,1106,2,I originally thought this wasn't a good question for the site but I changed my mind when I saw Scimonster's answer.,2017-06-25T23:52:14.363,283

1817,1088,0,When I wrote my answer I thought of two points: a superficial one which I covered and a deeper but more important one which I didn't. The second paragraph of this answer covers #2 perfectly and in many fewer words than I would have. Kudos Ted +1. Some of the other answers here seem to think that these hypothetical students have simply never spent two seconds thinking about the implications of security violations or that a few minutes of don't be bad it's not worth it will change someone's mindset; those scenarios strain credulity and seem like the the height of naivete to me.,2017-06-26T02:26:12.717,1166
1818,1083,0,_@BenI. well the unlocked door was merely the first step in the thought experiment chain leading to the idea of no security at all. I admit this answer is not my best work; I meant to come back and edit a second half in today but Ted already basically made the second major point that I wanted to cover. See [my comment under his answer](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1079/how-do-i-teach-ethics-in-hacking#comment1817_1088) for more.,2017-06-26T02:31:07.950,1166
1819,1106,1,Years and years ago before Software Engineering SE figured out its scope a very similar question was asked there. It's locked now and there's a lot to read through but there's still some good info there: [How can I find a good open source project to join?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/294/how-can-i-find-a-good-open-source-project-to-join),2017-06-26T03:00:09.707,1166
1820,1088,1,I never believed that I could cause people to act or not to act in any way. What I can do is try to draw the line of what good actions are; my students possess free will and will ultimately do as they choose. I am not in control of others. However our behavior *is* influenced by context. It is not the height of naivete to suggest that moral outcomes are influenced by contextual understandings nor that a teacher can play some part in setting that context into place. I may not control my students but I am not without influence.,2017-06-26T03:51:11.243,27

1825,1102,7,Once you've shown the problem with 1/3 it might be better to show 1/10 in binary. Although as noted above I could get recurring decimals there's a danger of people thinking it's something peculiar about _one third_. Seeing the same problem happening with a safe number like _one tenth_ drove the point home for binary representations.,2017-06-26T08:19:19.420,1372

1829,1115,1,Firstly I'd like to welcome you to Computer Science Educators! Secondly this answer is superb I do hope we will be hearing more from you.,2017-06-26T09:31:48.580,150
1832,592,0,From a perspective of someone working in the industry: please don't. Just tell them it was a design mistake in the language. Seemed like a good idea at the time but turned out to be a huge hurdle in everyday lives of poor Java programmers. Your own example is a good illustration for why it is a bad idea: you have repeated the same code over and over. Obviously the text of the song won't change but if you used switch with something that could you'd again had a problem with propagating the change through the code (possibly not owned by you).,2017-06-26T11:48:23.557,1000
1835,1097,0,A course at my Uni did this! There were two stages: At first we had to upload code that would be automatically tested against testcases and in the second stage we would upload testcases to run against the other students solutions. It was very fun to work against the testcases but the second stage was to easy as most students had not beat many testcases from the first stage and also the objective wasn't clear (do we have to pass our own cases?). Also as @immibis said you should make sure that the test cases are correct by running them against a reference solution.,2017-06-26T12:28:29.970,1381
1837,1102,3,+1 comment by @TripeHound about the dangers of safe/not-periodic numbers like 1/10 should be added to the answer. Also [the problem with subtraction](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27539234/4209853),2017-06-26T12:52:53.247,994

1839,1092,0,I had one of those job interview programming tests that worked like this. Every problem came with s handful of basic tests (not sufficient for complete coverage) and I wrote a function for one I don't remember what it was trying to do. Passed all the sample tests and even the more rigorous ones I added. I scored a 0. I never did find out why.,2017-06-26T13:11:43.157,1244

1845,1102,1,I would respectfully suggest that **this is a very misleading** example to illustrate the **computer science problem** of floating point precision. By using a repeating decimal as your example you are (incorrectly) turning this into the math problem of representing fractions as decimals rather than a computer science problem that 1.0f + 1.0f =! 2.0f. This will leave students with a lot of bugs and head scratching trying to figure out why this doesn't work (i.e. not understanding how floating point numbers are represented).,2017-06-26T14:26:34.007,23
1848,1124,1,FWIW the research (rather perversely) showed a pattern of computerized notes resulting in better *self-rating* of understanding but worse outcomes on simple recall tests.  So it is possible that you are falling victim to an illusion here. Also FWIW I also usually personally take notes on a computer because it's so darned convenient. So I am just as much a hypocrite as the next guy :),2017-06-26T15:01:57.177,27
1850,1099,1,Here is a YouTube video that gives an incredible explanation of floats: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdFG2GcNuA It's a speedrunner playing Super Mario 64 in an emulator going into detail about how floating point numbers give rise to some unusual glitches in the game. The video is both educational and genuinely fascinating.,2017-06-26T15:39:17.217,1360
1851,1102,0,_@RobertCartaino You have an excellent point that using a number that is not finite in base-10 could lead to some false assumptions. I used the example from the question ($\frac{1}{3}$) when writing this but I can see how it might be confusing. I think you cannot escape the fact that some numbers cannot be represented in binary leading to these errors which is **inherently a mathematical issue** but I've added some more explicit information on how to solve this problem. Is there anything specifically that you feel ought to be mentioned here that I missed?,2017-06-26T15:53:05.093,2
1853,1106,1,I am not sure what you are asking. Are you wanting to contribute to an open-sources/free-software project; create a project; or something else? Also note that the phase Free Software is much less confusing than Open Source. If you think not then write down the definition of both then check their definitions [ https://opensource.org/osd-annotated https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html ] to see how you did. Then wait a day and try again. In short they are both software that gives the user (whoever they are) freedoms: to use (for any use) modify distribute (for any fee).,2017-06-26T17:13:23.040,204
1854,1096,0,_@alephzero you are infinity confusing please cite all of your quotations. If we do not have a link to them how can we know what your point is.,2017-06-26T17:19:10.730,204
1855,1105,0,I just want to thank you for bringing your enthusiasm for learning here. Your future is bright. Shine on.,2017-06-26T17:19:16.890,1293
1856,1133,2,Very nice answer - I like the emphasis on clarity of the assignment itself. Welcome to [cseducators.se]! I hope we hear more from you in the future :),2017-06-26T17:42:10.083,27
1857,1097,1,I feel like you would get too many badly written test cases that fail when they shouldn't.  At the least have what you consider to be a very well written sample version of the code that you run the test cases against.  I'd probably ignore every test case that fails a valid sample code.  Sure someone may have written a test case that actually caught a bug in your sample 'working' implementation but most of the time they won't and it's not worth the effort of identifying which tests are valid and which aren't.,2017-06-26T17:47:09.980,1008
1858,327,0,Every student is different and has a different learning method trying to enforce what you think is the best learning method 'on average' can harm those that learn in a different manner then the average and thus best avoided.  For instance I retain less information when I take notes of any kind.  I find it's best to commit 100% of my focus to learning the material the first time through and if I have questions later I look up the information online which is faster and more accurate result then using my notes often would be for comp sci.  Would you penalize me for choosing to not take notes?,2017-06-26T17:53:44.333,1008
1859,1134,2,Alumnae (I thought it was spelled alumni o.o) Are often a good source of experience.,2017-06-26T17:53:58.710,150
1860,1131,2,I wasn't the downvoter but can guess why someone might not have liked your answer: You suggest that bias is rare and that it can be overcome through hard work. Many people consider that point of view to be backwards. I encourage you to read the articles linked to in my question (or answer) if you haven't already.,2017-06-26T17:54:54.763,283
1861,1099,0,I realize that this doesn't change the fact that you need to explain float behavior to students but you should also consider the way BigDecimal works--it shouldn't have the same type of binary rounding problems because it bypasses the whole thing by using Integers for all decimal calculations.,2017-06-26T17:56:07.450,1399
1862,1131,2,On what basis do you claim that mistreatment will be rare but that supervisors won't care about their background [if] they get the job done? That's not what I hear from people who have spent significant time in industry.,2017-06-26T17:57:08.310,283
1863,1131,0,_@EllenSpertus I am literally reading them now. I do believe that hard work can often do the trick. But I might be backwards in this. I'll finish reading the articles.,2017-06-26T17:58:51.593,150
1864,1134,10,Female graduates are alumnae. Alumni is for groups that include men. http://grammarist.com/usage/alumna-alumnae-alumni-alumnus/,2017-06-26T17:59:20.777,283
1865,1134,1,I did not know that. Thanks!,2017-06-26T18:00:16.587,150
1866,931,2,_@NunoGilFonseca no class is actually mandatory because your major isn't mandatory.  I have tutored people even smart people that were not able to conceptualize comp sci principles and for all they could squeeze by with barely passing grades in early classes were simply not suited as programmers.  If someone is graduating a course with so little retention it's possible that they fit in that category of students that will never feel natural in CS no matter how hard they try.  It is better to recognize that now when there is still time to pursue another major then 2 years later.,2017-06-26T18:04:22.277,1008
1871,1131,2,The problem (active rather than the more normal subconscious bias) seems most likely to occur when the management group comes from a narrow social group. Science and Medicine claim to suffer significantly too. I've not observed first hand but even in 'good' companies you can find examples of discrimination.,2017-06-26T18:38:01.060,41
1872,1131,0,_@SeanHoulihane That may be but could you tell me how it relates to my answer (I mean no disrespect I simply didn't understand `:)`).,2017-06-26T18:41:14.330,150
1873,1131,1,Hard work doesn't help when results are not the cause of the problem. Problem is (crudely) insecurity from the clique. In some environments this might be the norm but it's not something I regard as acceptable. Perception of this topic might vary depending on your context though the Q seems rather US biased UK may be better (but I have no evidence to justify that).,2017-06-26T18:47:42.353,41
1874,1092,1,In my experience some professors would make these tests available to students some would describe them in technical detail in class the next day and some would go through them individually during office hours.  I don't think I ever had a professor keep the tests a secret.  Have you tried going to the office of those who held out and asking?  Certainly as an educator I'd probably follow all three approaches simultaneously but they are by no means obligated to do so as finding the problem creates a very difficult but optional exercise for the student.,2017-06-26T18:53:59.713,1089
1875,1099,0,_@BillK the example in the question won't be better with BigDecimal. (Depending on how the division is done you might get an exception there. But 1/3 is not representable exactly as a decimal number either.),2017-06-26T19:09:06.237,653
1876,1102,3,a finite decimal may be a repeating binary fraction **and vice versa** ?€? Actually a finite binary fraction will always convert to a finite decimal fraction (with at most the same number of digits).,2017-06-26T19:11:42.070,653
1877,1038,1,Depending on their level of skill other good exercises might be Tower of Hanoi playing a game (nim tic-tac-toe checkers wumpus world...) solving/pathfinding through a maze a (basic) regular expression evaluator verifying a CFG and perhaps as a fun challenge write some code that detects infinite loops (first to complete the assignment gets a prize!).,2017-06-26T19:15:09.743,1406
1878,1102,0,_@Pa??loEbermann You're right. Thanks for pointing that out. I've amended that (and found a proof on Math.SE for anyone interested).,2017-06-26T19:15:29.440,2
1880,1099,1,How do you teach them the analogous **integer** problem (here in C): `int i = 1/3; i = 3 * i; printf(%d\n i);` -- surprise the result is 0.,2017-06-26T19:36:19.480,1410
1882,1102,2,Something I'd suggest adding as an exercise with a regular calculator is that you can see the extra digits it hides and then uses in rounding to make everything seem to work out as expected.  Ex if after entering `1/7` your calculator displays `0.14285714 you can hit subtract and type in `0.142857141` hit enter and it'll show something like `2.8571E-9`.  With the exact amount depending on the calculators internal representation.,2017-06-26T19:39:40.630,1411
1883,1102,3,_@RobertCartaino I do not understand your objection here. 1.0 + 1.0 _does_ equal 2.0 in common floating-point systems. The problem is instead with 1.0 / 10.0 * 10.0 which rounds well in decimal but not in binary and this answer explains why. Were you commenting on an earlier edit?,2017-06-26T19:41:08.450,1408
1884,1131,6,This is easily the best answer.  **Yes some people are biased.**  The best solution is to *excel so well* that biased people only hurt themselves by settling for second best (i.e. they don't get service from the best?€?you?€?they do business with someone else not as good).  Having the mindset that the deck is stacked against you and if you don't make it it's someone else's fault is a 100% certain route to failure *regardless of your race or sex.*  This is the best advice you can give anyone inclined to be a victim?€?but victim-minded people will undoubtedly label it as insensitive.,2017-06-26T19:42:12.193,1103
1886,1099,0,Actually I believe it will be better since it would be very obvious and predictable if the code fiddled with the precision (currently it casts it to float and double).  BigDecimal can't represent 1/3 exactly but if you set it to say 10 decimal places then every version of 1/3-1/3 should equal 0.  If you set one to 3 decimal places and the other to 4 you should always get a very predictable and sensible .0003.  The best part is you won't ever get rounding problems on numbers that shouldn't have rounding problems like .1,2017-06-26T19:43:05.487,1399
1887,1126,23,This question isn't specific to CS in any way and really belongs on https://academia.stackexchange.com.,2017-06-26T19:43:16.773,1103
1888,1131,1,_@Wildcard Thanks you. The general idea should work if done correctly (by students) but it is still rather backwards. If applied more widely it can bring some change of perspective. But there are more effective ways.,2017-06-26T19:48:05.100,150
1889,1126,6,_@Wildcard You raise an important issue. There's been so much attention lately on the environment in tech that I've been thinking of it as a CS education issue but you're right that people face bias in many fields. Some of the answers mention CS-specific resources while others are more general.,2017-06-26T19:48:17.227,283
1890,1131,6,_@Wildcard I agree that every student should try to excel and our students do. I think you misrepresent the view you disagree with by saying it attributes all failure to someone else's fault. Being aware of the possibility of discrimination can cause someone to avoid internalizing disrespect shown to them and to consider moving to a more hospitable environment.,2017-06-26T19:56:05.077,283
1892,1131,4,_@ItamarGreen that's a good distinction to draw: yes I definitely meant the most effective approach from an *individual student* perspective certainly not that no one should combat discrimination!  Discrimination against minorities (religious ethnic whatever) is [sadly very mainstream](https://www.standleague.org/news/media-watch/20170612-religious-discrimination-in-2017-sanctioned-by-disney-it-just-doesnt-add-up.html) and  I fully support eradicating bigotry and prejudice.  I just meant that using it at an individual level as a reason why you didn't succeed is a way to...not succeed.  :),2017-06-26T20:20:15.797,1103
1893,1131,5,_@Wildcard Bias puts people in really tough situations. It's pretty important to learn how to deal as well as possible with those situations (it's not as simple as just excel!) and how to cope with the fact that sometimes despite one's best efforts things may not go as well as they would've for someone else. That's really not the same thing as deciding that all failures are someone else's fault.,2017-06-26T20:30:42.737,1416
1894,1131,3,FWIW I've seen white males mistreated and their confidence battered even when they should have been secure (had a CS PhD hired and promoted at a top company etc.) Knowing that some people are just jerks (whether or not due to bias) can help anyone.,2017-06-26T20:35:04.133,283
1895,1138,0,Thanks Mike. I definitely plan to go through the material myself well in advance. My lack of knowledge of modern AI should be a plus as I stumble over material in advance of my students.,2017-06-26T20:37:33.480,283

1897,1138,0,It sounds like you took AI around when I took AI (prior to the MOOC) - even with it's limitations I really liked it. I also really liked Andrew Ng's ML course which was more project based.,2017-06-26T21:09:38.893,237
1898,1097,0,_@KarlKastor Are bad tests flushed out by testing them against a canonical implementation of the program?,2017-06-26T21:51:42.177,990
1899,1097,0,_@corsiKa In the Uni course I was talking about bad tests weren't 'flushed out' but you were limited to two tests and your implementation had to pass at least one of these. You were encouraged  to write cases that your own program would pass so that your program would pass more cases. But I think it would have been better to check the cases against a reference implementation and flushing them out.,2017-06-26T22:15:50.503,1381
1900,1142,0,What students do when they are having trouble completely depends on their personality. I think that the rise of services like Khan Academy have shown us that students like to make mistakes and get explanations without feeling judged (even though they are not).,2017-06-26T22:22:35.127,1397
1901,1142,0,_@tusharsoni Good point. I hadn't thought of ways a computer TA could be perceived as superior to a human TA.,2017-06-26T22:31:20.930,283

1904,1097,0,_@KarlKastor Makes sense. It also is a good lesson in that you need to have good tests before you have good testing. Sometimes people forget that tests are not always right and not always good forever - sometimes you break a test and the functionality has actually changed. Quality is a goal making tests pass never should be!,2017-06-27T00:44:08.760,990
1905,1131,1,If I read this correctly your suggestion is to let the market forces work against biased employers. If an employer does not retain the best they can only harm themselves in the long run and help competitors that hire purely on merit. There is an uncomfortable side to this though: this has the possibility of also eventually revealing statistics that show correlations between ability and race/gender/ethnicity/etc. We?€?re not afraid to find out right?,2017-06-27T01:13:16.520,1424
1906,266,0,_@tusharsoni Actually wrote my own. Link is in my profile.,2017-06-27T01:55:48.913,30
1908,1136,0,I like how you stress the difference between rounding and conversion. However your use of terminology is slightly incorrect compared to IEEE754. Conversion is the process of switching between decimal and float. In some cases switching back and forth will not lose information. However there is usually still rounding taking place in those conversions possibly even if after converting back you end up with the same result (the two roundings simply cancelled out in that case). I would be hesitant to oversimplify things here as that might do more harm than good in the long run.,2017-06-27T07:24:30.050,1370
1909,1136,2,_@ComicSansMS I'm trying to get away from the myth that the discrepancies in floats are just rounding errors.  I've seen to many students turn in code that attempts to correct the problem with their own rounding code. That's the oversimplification to avoid.,2017-06-27T08:24:59.203,1401
1910,1099,0,A useful model that keeps most of the floating point problems is a computer that works with two decimal places. So you can exactly represent 75 and 0.12 but 114 is rounded to 110. Then you can go through practical examples like finding the middle point between 92 and 94 that in the naive implementation is 95.,2017-06-27T08:39:14.297,1433
1911,1134,9,I'm a white man and I have been in the computing industry since I finished my doctorate in 1991 but I still feel like an impostor. +1 for teaching your students about Impostor Syndrome,2017-06-27T09:16:15.693,1436
1912,1115,0,If you need accuracy beyond the float standard use integer math or a data type like [Decimal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1056323/difference-between-numeric-float-and-decimal-in-sql-server).,2017-06-27T09:47:04.117,1437

1916,1143,1,_@thesecretmaster But that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking how I can demonstrate it.,2017-06-27T11:00:28.797,150
1918,1102,0,_@Gilles - where in the world is this true? I'm in europe and that is literally a grade school material. The only way someone might not understand that is if they have a mental handicap.,2017-06-27T11:09:06.217,1145
1919,1102,1,_@Davor There's a huge gap between vaguely understanding that $1/3$ is not equal to $0.33$ and understanding infinitary decimal representation. Understanding that $0.\bar 9 = 1$ (as opposed to $0.\bar 9 \approx 1$) is a very difficult milestone. Having heard it in school is not the same thing as understanding it.,2017-06-27T11:17:17.113,124

1925,1143,1,This feels like a semi-hidden self-learning question.  If it is truly a self-learning question then that's okay (encouraged even) but then post it as such and you don't need to couch the learning in terms of what other people need (i.e. the *students* simply don't see...).  If it's not a self-learning question then the answer is very simple: just perform a SQL injection attack on one of their sites in front of them and watch their jaws drop.,2017-06-27T14:04:51.737,27
1930,1147,1,Thanks! Could you specify in the answer what's the example? (Not being lazy I will watch the video but it's preferable if you added the example to your answer),2017-06-27T14:46:07.270,150
1931,1143,9,What if you were to do a two part assignment? Give them a library through which to route their sql queries and make this library vulnerable to sql injection. Have them come in and show you their project using that library and then in the middle of the demo wipe their database using the libraries vulnerability. Tell them not to worry about it you will address it in the next lecture and in the next lecture tell the class about injection. In the second part give them the source to the library and have them fix the injection. This also teaches them to be concerned about libraries they use.,2017-06-27T14:53:35.023,1456

1960,1157,0,The pre rec for the class is an intro to programming class that teaches the basics of python but many students have done work outside of class and picked up skills.

1966,1154,0,We are not nearly as large as SO. We try to greet new posters both as a way to humanize the community here and as a way to check in with initial post quality.  I think (hope?) it helps set the stage for a warm welcoming and on-topic community :),2017-06-27T19:37:08.783,27
1967,1150,1,There is a large difference between computer science and programming. What are you teaching the high school students exactly?,2017-06-27T20:01:34.230,1476
1968,1126,3,A small suggestion: edit the title to make it explicit that you're referring to social rather than technical bias? Given the topic of the site the first time I saw this question I assumed it was going to be about like people who were biased in favor of using one programming language over another. Normally I'd change it myself but I don't want to steamroll the post as an outsider. I have chars left so: I 100% agree this is on-topic here. While it's true that many types of biases exist in many different places there are definitely challenges that are unique to CS and CS education.,2017-06-27T20:11:21.507,202
1969,1126,1,_@Pops Thanks for the suggestion. I've also been considering changing bias to mistreatment since that's more general (and less controversial).,2017-06-27T20:13:45.523,283
1970,1126,1,I don't think that would achieve your goal; regarding generality you can be biased against someone (consciously or otherwise) without taking any action against them and as for controversy mistreatment sounds more contentious than bias to me.,2017-06-27T20:17:46.567,202
1971,1126,0,_@Pops The reason I say that mistreatment is less controversial is that some people deny the existence of bias (or think that it is over-emphasized) while I don't think anyone disputes that people sometimes get mistreated in the workplace.,2017-06-27T20:28:51.250,283
1972,1126,0,That's true but this post is still (I'm assuming; please correct me if I'm wrong) going to be referring to mistreatment stemming from or having to do with bias so I don't foresee the distinction helping. This is getting pretty speculative now though. Good question in any case!,2017-06-27T20:37:37.387,202
1973,1144,6,Just make sure all the students have offline backsups first.  It's all fun and games until the pen testers destroy a production system afterall.,2017-06-27T20:42:53.493,1411
1974,1162,3,Unfortunately. I'd like more commentary here that doesn't in some way imply that the victim is responsible for the problem or for solving the problem. Racism isn't caused by POC. Nor is sexism caused by women.,2017-06-27T20:51:14.253,1293
1975,1143,5,Pictures do a great job especially when you the teacher aren't the source.  https://xkcd.com/327/        There used to be a site where you could practice these types of things trying to trigger specific errors which would give you a username/password to get to the next step of the game... unfortunately the domain went bye-bye and is now owned by some squatter... haven't found a replacement resource...,2017-06-27T21:35:24.640,662

1982,1134,1,If their families lack connections (which is overwhelmingly the case for my students) they should take advantage of other ways to get a foot in the door paying it forward later really spoke to me. So many people get their first job through some connection (networking family fellow alumni) so if you don't have that network it makes perfect sense to use a different method (outreach program etc.) to substitute for the same leg up many people get.,2017-06-27T23:35:36.633,1473

1993,1161,0,Note that it is the last in the list of recommended courses for most of the engineering ones which tallies with the advice I had many years ago ( to study engineering at Cambridge do art or music O-level rather than CS as the relevant bits of O-level CS would be covered in a couple of lectures do further maths rather than CS at A ).,2017-06-28T09:21:11.950,1498
1996,146,1,In the essence OOP is based on messages and contracts an object pass a message to another which will eventualy return a value whatever it does within in process is unkwown by the sender of the message. Otherwise a good way to restrict the scope of your question would be to limit yourself to encapsulation polymorphism and inheritance. Which is the basis of OOP. Patterns (singleton) that come as specific usage of those bases is a somewhat another subject that come after.,2017-06-28T11:02:40.313,1375
1999,1144,0,On the other hand as soon as they start using prepared statements which should be from the get-go they will no longer be vulnerable. Better to attack say WebGoat - and to know that a lot of old-school sites are still vulnerable.,2017-06-28T11:05:05.407,913

2007,1144,2,_@tucuxi I think that's the point the OP is trying to make to his students.  Don't do it the stupid way and you close off a huge vulnerability.,2017-06-28T12:24:55.203,1411
2010,1161,0,The actual CS parts of a 1990s CS A-level are still useful to me as a physics postdoc (the turbo pascal I learnt for the coding parts less so).  They've also been beneficial when working in engineering.  In general *any* exposure to CS concepts will help when students first encounter programming in something like a physics degree because there's no time to cover it. Some examples: Pseudocode; RAM vs. storage; data types; flow of control.,2017-06-28T12:56:08.783,1127

2013,1156,0,I like this answer very much. Also welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-06-28T13:16:40.113,27
2014,1171,0,I like this method: being able to see their individual commits would help.,2017-06-28T13:25:20.910,7
2015,1180,0,This question is quite broad. You're asking for advice so general that you even mentioned it's applications in other fields. In addition there is plenty of advice out there on this topic which you could research.,2017-06-28T13:50:59.813,58
2021,1183,0,A question definitely. _How_ to do it if it is a goal not whether to attempt it.,2017-06-28T14:36:51.147,1293
2022,1180,0,I mentioned martial arts in the original only to suggest it is different but possible in other fields. But I agree that it is broad. That is why I pose it. I think the community as a whole can suggest ways to work toward it.,2017-06-28T14:38:29.900,1293
2023,1180,1,Stack Exchange is for Q&A not discussion. Normally discussion questions are too broad for our scope and belong in a different venue.,2017-06-28T14:39:29.790,58
2025,1187,0,Interesting answer. Breaking the project into separate independent components is what I ended up doing as a student when I was a member of a group assignment. I still ended up doing a majority of the work. However using version control as you and others have pointed out would have shown who performed what at least in my case.,2017-06-28T15:02:51.780,7
2026,1187,0,Even commit logs would not prevent the software equivalent of plagiarism but in the real world it often happens that different individuals or teams are given separate assignments and the system is architected in such a way that they can all work independently without blocking each other until integration time.,2017-06-28T15:14:41.647,1292
2027,1187,0,In my case it wasn't plagiarism because the others weren't passing my work off as their own but you could certainly structure an assignment that way (where others helping complete a component that is not theirs is plagiarism). I'm not sure how useful that structure would be and as you say you can't really get around that with just version control anyway. In any case version control is not a fix-all for sure but it would have solved my team's problem when I was a student.,2017-06-28T15:17:29.637,7
2028,1190,0,Hi Chris! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! It's great that you suggested an actual project and grading criteria.,2017-06-28T15:27:11.530,58
2029,1190,0,I don't understand they are high school students how do you suggest they manage to crack hashed passwords?,2017-06-28T15:29:57.353,150
2032,1193,2,This question is really broad. There are so many frontiers that could be discussed. A book could be written on this topic.,2017-06-28T15:43:45.283,58
2034,1190,0,The OP/teacher does that whilst marking their hardened projects in semester 2. I'm in the UK so don't know what age these student are but if they are being taught this stuff it seems reasonable they should be able to prevent it occurring. Note I have edited my answer to clarify that the students are given the task of hardening their semester one projects prior to them being marked in semester two. That bit was in my head but didn't manage to make it into the answer first time ;-),2017-06-28T16:00:47.183,1513
2035,1193,1,Was immediately reminded of [the SMBC about quantum computing](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3) (not to be confused with [the SMBC about quantum computers](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=4057)).,2017-06-28T16:04:59.147,1166
2037,1180,1,This is really too broad. You may want to consider asking a new question about differentiation within (for instance) labs or lecture or code-alongs. I could write a book about differentiation within the CS classroom overall. (And I'm actually considering doing so!),2017-06-28T16:27:12.540,27
2041,1180,1,Actually @Ellen Spertus I'm trying to _avoid_ differentiation not promote it. Tracking would never be my solution though I would look at answers that suggest it. How can help everyone learn everyone contribute?,2017-06-28T16:45:45.623,1293
2042,1190,1,_@Chris the students are 16 years old. I'm sorry to say but they are nowhere near the level of cracking a hash. Some *might* manage to do it. Regardless I think it's much better to *award* points for successfully preventing the listed attacks rather than dock points off from students who did not manage to do something that is far beyond their level.,2017-06-28T16:50:58.347,150
2043,1180,0,I'm a little confused here. You are _avoiding_ differentiation? Differentiation != tracking. As written I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. I thought I had a beat on it as a question about differentiation but if it's not that I'm not sure what you're trying to get at. What you're looking for is a more student-centered approach which is at the heart of differentiated instruction. Please clarify otherwise this is too broad/vague.,2017-06-28T16:59:24.803,76
2047,1193,1,_@thesecretmaster you seem to be favoring only questions that can be definitively answered with the one true answer. I think that is too narrow. There are questions that different people will answer quite differently without it being just _opinion_ or _discussion_. If the criteria are applied _too_ strictly it will get in the way and discourage people. This question can have many answers all different all correct and more important all thought-provoking.,2017-06-28T17:05:46.350,1293
2049,1193,1,_@Buffy I have my personal views on which questions are too broad and which are not. I will not abuse my moderator power by closing questions based on that evaluation but I can express my opinion. In this case I believe that multiple books could be (and have been) written on each frontier of CS and that is far too broad to be covered in one answer. If you'd like to discuss this further (which I'd be happy to do) please [start a new room with me](https://chat.stackexchange.com/users/162795) to avoid taking up comment space.,2017-06-28T17:08:41.753,58

2055,1179,0,I took Latin in high school for required foreign language credit and because I thought it may help improve my vocabulary for ACT/SAT tests later.  I also took my first formal programming course (had been programming for several years before) in high school because it was my first chance to get onto a real computer instead of my TRS-80 and 8088 (VAX via green screen terminals doign Fortran and Cobol).,2017-06-28T17:38:41.307,662
2056,1196,0,I don't disagree with the value of pair programming or your take on it but I'm still unsure as to the question to which this is an appropriate answer. Is it merely how to get every student involved in every class meeting? I also don't see how this is _not_ differentiation...,2017-06-28T17:41:58.810,76
2057,1196,0,Perhaps I'm interpreting the tag too narrowly in which case I apologize. I based it on the description on the Tags page only.,2017-06-28T17:47:45.970,1293
2058,1180,0,Too broad I think. If you focus on some specific scenarios you're likely to get more good answers. It also makes it easier for people to disagree with a broad-brush approach in specific subject areas.,2017-06-28T18:00:02.643,41
2059,1196,0,Fair enough. That tag description is inaccurate. You _are_ asking about differentiation. I will improve the tag.,2017-06-28T18:01:59.153,76
2061,1180,2,_@Buffy Based on the DVs and CVs I am going to close this question. What you are asking is an important issue to address but as worded this is too broad (and to be fair the tag confusion did not help; this is absolutely a question about differentiation). I get the sense that the community also feels this way. I do encourage you to re-ask this with a more narrow scope and shorter background so the focus is more on the question itself.,2017-06-28T18:22:54.673,76
2062,1180,0,No objection. I'm sorry that it didn't find acceptance of course but I don't know how I can improve it and reach the goal of collecting techniques.,2017-06-28T18:43:41.290,1293
2064,1150,0,_@RemcoGerlich sadly both GCSE (14-16 years old) and A-Level (16-18 years old) do not have enough programming but they do have some. A controlled assessment for GCSE and a project for A-Level. Plus the exam can ask questions on programming.,2017-06-28T18:50:10.863,204
2065,1180,2,_@Buffy Be short sweet and to the point. What are techniques for differentiation in a CS classroom with a wide range of student abilities? or How do I actively engage all students in the learning process when there are great discrepancies in student ability? Also try to narrow it to a particular aspect - maybe lecture or first instruction or labs. Pick one aspect to focus on.,2017-06-28T18:54:47.190,76
2068,1193,1,A good teaching technique is to introduce a topic and some of its features and terminology before it is necessary to address it in detail. It need not be a frontier topic. It can be one (compilers AI ...) that will be studied in due course. So you are asking for ideas to prime the pump. I am applauding.,2017-06-28T19:17:34.327,1293

2087,445,0,As a Junior in high school my daughter became a teacher's assistant in a technical program. She actually knew quite a lot more about the contents of the program than the teacher did so he delegated a lot of the responsibility to her including reviewing hte work of other students which enabled him to take care of the details (school politics etc) that students shouldn't be involved in. The biggest problem with that was some students resented the perceived amount of pull she had even as her role was primarily coaching them towards better grades.,2017-06-29T04:08:44.960,1537
2088,335,0,You don't.  It's their device. If they're old enough to bring their own laptop they will do what they will will do. Your class simply (hah!) needs to be more engaging than the game.  You might actually encourage modding games since that is a programming skill set.  Minecraft is particularly open to modders but many other popular games are as well.,2017-06-29T04:32:40.723,1537
2089,443,0,My daughter is in a technical program in high school where she is well beyond the level of the teacher or the coursework so she TA's.  She takes on a management role for class projects and helps to review/coach/prescreen other students work. this frees the teacher to take care of non-technical and non-classroom things that are a part of running a technical class.,2017-06-29T05:23:28.510,1537
2090,1158,0,Your first quote suggests it's the use of CS end products that are the new literacy. I think you need to make the connection between basic CS and future applications. Specifically to emphasise learning CS over a 'digital litteracy' course which teaches 'how to learn a new app once it is released',2017-06-29T07:59:27.163,41
2091,1190,0,Okay maybe a marking system that promotes positive reinforcement rather than marking them down would be more appropriate for 16 year olds. However what they have to be taught is that you don't need to be a genius to do something like crack a hash. All you need is to download a tool with a decent dictionary and away you go. If you have a modern GPU you can crack tens of thousands in a minute,2017-06-29T07:59:51.227,1513
2092,1144,0,_@tucuxi As soon as they start using prepared statements - well this sounds like something you'd only do a few times and stop doing once the students start really thinking about security.,2017-06-29T09:24:31.217,1275
2093,1156,0,I don't like the idea of giving them a vulnerable library. If I was the student I would understand better if I was shown the vulnerability in my own code. If you have a predetermined library vulnerability it looks no different to a backdoor - all it demonstrates is that the professor's libraries can't be trusted. The point of a security demonstration should be to show people that **their own code** can't be trusted!,2017-06-29T09:28:52.453,1275
2094,1156,0,_@immibis I had considered that but doing the same thing with an individual's code for each student would require the instructor to fig l find a SQL injection risk in each application.

2099,1144,0,_@DanNeely my point is that the students may feel cheated if they are requested to invest too much time writing insecure code and then breaking it (by using vulnerable string-concatenation queries) instead of being shown how to avoid this much earlier (by using prepared statements). Burned fingers teach but they may resent you for setting them up.,2017-06-29T12:53:31.313,913
2105,1090,0,IMHO the struggle exists because students start from an imperative PL. This order is incorrect from a theoretical viewpoint: imperative programming is a special case of functional programming as you know from learning Haskell. This is the reason for the suggestion that ?€?students should start with a functional language?€?.,2017-06-29T14:07:14.657,160
2106,1090,0,The paradigm of functional programming as it is commonly understood is a bunch of concepts. You mentioned some of them. For example sum types belong there too. Every concept require its own approach. Considering them together as one monolithic thing is not useful. The ?€?paradigm?€? concept is doing a disservice here.,2017-06-29T14:07:28.157,160

I don't know so much about the others... helpdesk tech doesn't require a degree (CS or otherwise) and I can see CS being helpful for a PM but their _primary_ training should be in management not tech.,2017-06-29T15:24:35.767,1166
2114,1218,7,You may disagree but IMO CS and programming are very different things. CS is (or aspires to be) science (or perhaps mathematics) On the other hand programming is very much a *skilled craft* and more like (advanced) carpentry than pure science. If some CS majors become strong programmers and can easily find work as such that is probably more by accident than design. The others might have been better served by a course in computer engineering rather than computer science.,2017-06-29T15:33:29.607,1352
2116,1218,3,_@alephzero Do you mean software engineering? Computer engineering programs involve more hardware than CS or SE programs. (My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science & Engineering.) In any case small schools tend to just have CS which includes both programming and theory with various electives. We prepare students for both industry and grad school.,2017-06-29T15:44:48.633,283
2119,1217,0,Uh? I don't mention primitive data types anywhere in my question and I don't see what this has to do with imperative programming. I guess your point is to teach imperative programming without introducing explicit mutable state only external actions? That's an interesting idea but it's rather hard to extract from the irrelevant digression into data types. And your answer doesn't actually say anything about whether this makes it easier to learn assignments.,2017-06-29T15:51:11.610,124
2121,1220,0,Requirements engineer would be a great opportunity for those students. Depending on the team they may have the chance to do some light development work as well furthering their technical skills and possibly leading into a full programming job later in their career.,2017-06-29T16:40:59.347,1013
2122,1218,0,Don't sell your students short. A person who can think and write will probably be the boss of those with only technical skills. A person who can ask the _right_ question is as valuable as the person who can provide an answer. As for specifics the other answers here especially @( Piyush Parikh) are quite good. But a good liberal arts college focuses on the big picture which add value to any organization.,2017-06-29T17:06:17.677,1293
2123,1126,1,_@EllenSpertus What concerns me about this approach is creating a situation in which people feel the need to assess issues in the wrong light. Person A and person B are likely to experience many of the same issues but person B may be inclined to process these issues in such a way that it leads them to inaccurate or detrimental conclusions. I feel as though people are quite intuitively aware that 'there are some jerks out there'. I simply fear that people who insist commonplace issues are related to their sex/race/etc. are not always confronting issues in a meaningful way.,2017-06-29T17:16:41.533,1448
2124,1220,0,Great ideas! How can I prepare the students for entry level jobs?,2017-06-29T17:20:59.780,283
2125,970,2,Your third-and-second-to-last paragraphs are really important. The zoo type introductions to OO are in my opinion extremely destructive. They can mess up how people think about OO design in a subtle way for a really long time. Switches lights and anything where there's a natural input output and desired behavior are so much better than a cat is an animal so Cat.MakeNoise() should return 'meow'.,2017-06-29T17:23:19.687,1218
2126,970,2,This can also lead on really nicely to encapsulation and abstraction as concepts. Note that the wiring from a switch to a lightbulb isn't accessible to the user. And that not knowing whether a class member should be public or private is like not knowing whether part of a TV should be on the inside or outside!,2017-06-29T17:23:23.470,1218
2128,970,0,Exactly @BenAaronson . It's not a *perfect* analogy as the programmer often is the electrician messing about with the wires but the general idea holds up pretty well.,2017-06-29T17:33:38.917,1244
2129,1224,0,Do you have a list of classes your school offers?,2017-06-29T17:35:03.083,1463
2131,1219,0,Thanks for your answer! Specifying a version for JDK definitely works for Java across platforms but other languages such as C++ C are platform dependent. Students write platform dependent code that works on their computer and doesn't on a different platform.,2017-06-29T17:43:19.573,1397
2132,1220,0,_@EllenSpertus I'd like to help more and I tried to touch on skills to work on at the ends of my sections but I guess I'm not sure quite what you're looking for. Things you can teach directly in your classes? Other classes to recommend? Internships to suggest? Connections to try to make? Something else?,2017-06-29T17:44:27.447,1166
2133,1219,0,Your grading setup seems organized but still has a lot of manual work. We eventually ended up investing the time to automate all of that. Saved TAs and instructors a bunch of time,2017-06-29T17:44:40.347,1397
2135,1208,0,I really like that you are using Online AutoGrader as an option. When we tried similar options the issue was that students worked in a 'fake' environment i.e. their browser. We wanted to make sure they were learning to use the right tools such as their IDEs learn debugging in them etc.,2017-06-29T17:46:01.227,1397
2137,1208,0,Indeed. It works better for small-ish lab type assignments not as much for projects. On some projects though I'll break them into pieces and have them submit each piece online for testing. By the time they turn in their full project I've already got a decent idea of how their code is going to work.  That said I've found the opposite of the fake environment problem. Being a primitive IDE without any help makes the focus on the problem and helps learn the methods.,2017-06-29T17:53:02.087,30
2138,1228,0,I'm not sure I see how the last to sentences are related... Could you expand on that?,2017-06-29T17:55:58.983,150
2139,1228,0,Does that help?,2017-06-29T17:58:52.987,1463
2140,1228,0,But how is it related to oop?,2017-06-29T17:59:53.840,150
2141,1224,0,None of our current classes would be appropriate. The only CS1 class we have is Java 1. The CS0 class isn't considered rigorous enough for the BS degree which I agree with.,2017-06-29T18:01:23.473,283
2142,1228,0,This fits for JS OOP so I don't know if the idea gets across to other languages or not,2017-06-29T18:02:28.277,1463
2144,1180,0,Hmmm. Been there done that but at 73 I think I'll pass. Thanks for the sentiment though.,2017-06-29T18:03:34.660,1293
2145,1228,0,Oh. ok... Sorry I'll make my question clearer.,2017-06-29T18:08:57.767,150
2148,1229,0,`private` is **not often implemented*? Urrrm I don't think so...,2017-06-29T18:19:07.137,150
2149,1229,2,Object level private is not often built in to languages class level private is common; a distinction. It is a language function not a program choice. Clarified in the answer I hope.,2017-06-29T18:21:17.603,1293
2150,1229,0,They are not complete novices. .. but the bookshelf analogy is very nice.,2017-06-29T18:24:49.430,150
2152,1220,0,I would also add quality assurance (software testing) to this list. It does require a few additional skills depending on which kind of testing they end up doing. Like hands on vs integration testing. But most of the skills acquired as a CS major should make them more appealing as a tester.,2017-06-29T18:26:54.933,1530
2153,1228,1,I'm not sure I understand your example but find it confusing. visibility is about well visibility. Laws are about applicability. A private method can have a global effect on a computation though it can't be referenced globally.,2017-06-29T18:29:35.847,1293
2155,1220,0,_@jmathew I actually kept that off the list intentionally. If the student doesn't enjoy coding or their coding skills are weak I don't think they'd enjoy testing code or do a good job looking through code to find out why tests failed.,2017-06-29T18:35:46.900,1166
2156,1228,0,I understand where you are coming from the analogy seemed to make sense in my head but I guess it didn't come across would it be smart just to take it down so no one in the future gets tripped up?,2017-06-29T18:38:52.687,1463
2159,1143,1,I have a response that doesn't answer the question.  Ditch MySQL in favor of the equally free postgres not because my flavor of RDBMS is better than yours but because postgres supports prepared statements which the typical MySQL installation does not. Teach them to do everything through prepared statements in which the SQL is passed to the RDBMS for precompile and after that only the reference to the compiled access path plus paramaters are passed so SQL injection is not possible.  Fringe benefit: eliminate 50 to 80% of the overhead of every SQL call.,2017-06-29T20:56:21.870,1537
2160,1131,1,This is incorrect. Employers will very often turn a blind eye to blatant harassment. Susan Fowler's account at Uber is a prime example of this. She is a talented engineer yet when she was faced by blatant harassment that was well documented by her and other women at Uber HR and management (all the way up to the CTO) completely rebuffed her. Inherent bias doesn't go away when you're good at your job and women shouldn't have to change jobs in order to be free of harassment.,2017-06-29T20:59:58.463,1553
2163,1205,0,My university program had linux servers available for use in labs and remotely via SSH. All of our code had to compile on a specific server (which  we could not install packages on) and were submitted into a directory on said server. It made the acquiring of code and execution environment very simple to manage.,2017-06-29T21:11:28.423,788
2164,1180,0,How do you know (or how could you even prove) that this goal is scientifically realistic?  If not your directive will fail and that has a cost/benefit ratio.,2017-06-29T21:23:47.987,59
2165,1180,0,Still important to me and my students that I try and seek to find ways toward the goal even if Zeno like it is out of reach.,2017-06-29T21:36:46.630,1293
2166,437,0,Yes Ellen Spertus I agree with what you say and felt and feel uncomfortable because of that. Nevertheless in the CS1 course I taught this past spring  women were 25% more likely to complete the course successfully than men.  I've had similar outcomes in the small number of other classes in which I took this approach. The sample size is too small for this to be publishable but my sense is that this does help.,2017-06-29T21:54:06.367,394
2167,1250,0,Nice ideas here.  Welcome to [cseducators.se].  I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-06-29T21:59:32.123,27
2168,1246,4,I like this analogy very much.  Short to the point and mimics the relationships well.  Welcome to [cseducators.se].  I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-06-29T22:00:52.937,27
2169,1248,1,This answer is a little shorter than good answers typically are but I must say it contains surprisingly high-quality content for its length.  Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-06-29T22:02:37.600,27
2170,1156,0,_@Sidney Then I suggest picking one student's code and demonstrating that to the whole class - the point is that you didn't write the code so you didn't plant the vulnerability there. Hopefully most students will see how their own code has the same bug but any student who doesn't understand the demonstration can come to you individually like with any other problem.,2017-06-29T22:42:17.567,1275
2173,1134,1,_@nocomprende: alumnus and alumni are both gendered male (http://www.dictionary.com/browse/alumni) so I don't see what's odd about using the female alumna/alumnae when referring to all-female graduates. Are you suggesting using the neutral alumnum/alumna for all graduates? That seems reasonable to me but your comment is rather vague.,2017-06-30T00:05:01.977,1473
2177,1248,0,Thank you. Could you elaborate on the information available on the list?,2017-06-30T00:30:04.533,283
2179,1229,0,I emphasized class v object private since students often get it wrong. I once built a language that had object-private (for my compiler course) and learned that it has issues/problems/grief. But note that such a feature protects _code_ from other _code_ rather than _code_ from other _programmers_. One object can't in such a system step on the state of another even in the same class. But one programmer programmed both objects by building their class so is able to prevent inconsistent state. Theoretically. Though bugs happen.,2017-06-30T00:39:23.730,1293
2181,1254,2,Hi Chris!  This is something of a stub answer.  Would you mind editing it?  Don't worry the norms of answering on SE sites are not always obvious and you're definitely not the first one to have a problem like this :) What can you tell us about Web-CAT?  What are its strong points and its weaker points?,2017-06-30T01:31:21.763,27
2182,1256,0,Hi Paula.  Thanks for sharing your experiences and welcome to [cseducators.se]! I hope we hear more from you in the future :),2017-06-30T01:32:55.420,27
2183,1226,0,You need examples of why you would use one access level over another to engage their intuition.,2017-06-30T02:34:13.447,1567
2187,1255,1,It's like you were listening to the original conversation I had at the party! I was an EMT too and made the exact same analogy! Well maybe not _exact_ same but incredibly similar. EMTs follow a pre-written set of protocols almost cookbook-style whereas doctors are expected to do more thinking. Analysis synthesis and creation. In summary it's the clinician/technician difference. Your answer makes me really happy. I don't know if the _average_ person knows enough about medical infrastructure to really get it though. What responses have you gotten when you've used it?,2017-06-30T04:04:53.263,1166
2188,918,1,You're giving me a lot of credit when you should be giving it to my audience. He was really sharp and interested. Guess you'd expect that from a doctor.,2017-06-30T04:15:06.903,1166
2189,1143,0,Teach ethics prior to having students do anything like this. Obtain written acknowledgement from students that accessing computing resources without written permission from the owner including manipulating a database can be felony under the CFAA.,2017-06-30T07:08:00.900,765
2190,1143,0,Assign students to groups and have each group member provide other group members written permission to attack their site. Or provide a classroom site and have students add their name to a table `Successful_hackers`. The classroom will suffer -- providing a teachable moment -- if any student vandalizes the site by dropping the table.,2017-06-30T07:08:21.683,765
2191,1229,0,Just for completeness' sake: in Smalltalk there are no access levels however instance variables are always object-private and methods are always public so the concept of object-private is as old as OO itself. In Ruby instance variables are always object-private and the `private` access level for methods also means object-private. In Scala `private` can be accompanied with a scope specifier and a scope specifier of `this` (i.e. `private[this]`) means object-private. Note that the fact that only an object itself can know about its own representation is a fundamental feature of OO so ?€?,2017-06-30T07:13:54.080,945
2192,1229,0,?€? if you don't have object-private you cannot to OO! That's why e.g. in Java only instances of interfaces are objects (because interfaces don't specify representation only behavior and thus representation is necessarily hidden) instances of classes aren't (because you *cannot* make representation object-private with classes).,2017-06-30T07:15:24.690,945
2193,1244,0,That's a good analogy for how `private` works in Ruby for example but in Java `private`s *are* visible to other objects.,2017-06-30T07:17:22.573,945
2195,1265,0,I was hoping answers would form a collection of activities that teachers could draw on. Perhaps clarify the answer (or split into multiple answers) to describe the key activities of the unit? Is the jist of the GUTS life science activities to have students adjust parameters of a predator-prey model? Do students explore increases and decreases of specific traits in populations over time to address NGSS middle school Life Science 4-6? https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/ms-ls4-6-biological-evolution-unity-and-diversity,2017-06-30T07:56:51.563,765

2197,1270,2,I'm not a big fan of Project Euler. A lot of the problems are maths problems not algorithm problems they both require and provide little insight into computer science. (Unless the insight you want to convey is that domain knowledge often beats programming knowledge.),2017-06-30T10:17:10.793,945
2198,1270,0,_@J??rgWMittag The idea is giving them problem solving skills.,2017-06-30T10:24:47.577,150
2199,1260,3,You may want first to fix what kind of problems do you want them to solve ? Raw Algorithm ? Software design ? Low level problem ? (Performance problems IO Management Cache Memory Floating precision limits ...). To be honest unless you're with very beginners I disapprouve the fact to have your students write the first solution to the problem they think about because it often miss edges cases low level related problems code written badly and not maintenable... everything we hate to see as professionals even if it works,2017-06-30T11:04:23.803,1375
2200,1244,0,_@J??rgWMittag urm. not they're not. maybe with Getters and Setters but not directly.,2017-06-30T11:21:02.280,150
2201,1244,0,That's backwards of how I learned and understand it.  Private in Java is not accessible for outside classes.,2017-06-30T11:22:16.640,30
2202,1229,0,Yes @J??rgWMittag thanks and (blush). I was too focused on Java. I've spent some time this morning wondering why I didn't pick up on the Ruby distinction. Looking back over my old code structure I realize I just don't write code in which the need to know is important. One object directly modifying another is bad practice whether or not the language permits it. If memory serves (not always) my first OOP language was (Apple) Object Pascal in which things were public so you had to develop a safe style. Thanks for putting me straight. I'm not sure I entirely understand your second note.,2017-06-30T11:32:25.770,1293
2203,1248,0,The SIGCSE mailing list is just that. A mailing list to all members in which members can pose issues and others comment. It is similar to this site but for issues that come and go rather than for archiving solutions. Sometimes it is quite noisy other times quiet. It values discussion where this site does not. Since you have joined @EllenSpertus you will have plenty of examples soon.,2017-06-30T11:41:09.060,1293

2207,1229,0,The significance of what is sometimes called *Autognosis* is well explained in [*On Understanding Data Abstraction Revisited*](http://CS.UTexas.Edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf) by [William R. Cook](http://WCook.BlogSpot.Com/). The basic idea is that objects are hidden behind a behavioral interface and only an object itself knows about its own representation. That's different from Abstract Data Types where representation is only hidden from instances of different *types* but accessible to other instances of the same type. In Java classes there is no way to express this constraint ?€?,2017-06-30T12:00:29.137,945
2208,1229,0,?€? (even `private` is still accessible to other objects of the same class) but interfaces cannot specify representation (no fields no private methods) so when you only use interfaces as types (no primitives and no classes) then you can guarantee object-oriented encapsulation.,2017-06-30T12:02:15.270,945
2212,1244,0,No wonder students find it tough. We're confusing each other :)  My understanding is that private is private to the class not the object. So your linked code only works because it's a Demo object referencing another Demo object. Look at http://bit.ly/2txr3Kd . The Other class would not work because they're different classes. Fortunately it's rare for early coders to have an object deal with another instance of the same class so it doesn't come up often. Only place I usually see this oddity is when they're writing compareTo methods.,2017-06-30T12:14:14.033,30
2215,1270,1,_@J??rgWMittag I very much disagree with you about Project Euler. I once had (but now can't find) a list of p.e. problems broken down by CS principle. They really are fairly brilliant problems. However if you want something less math *focused* you may enjoy [Programming Praxis](https://programmingpraxis.com).,2017-06-30T12:21:01.737,27
2217,1267,0,I don't entirely understand the problem. Do we have some way of determining what D.W. will earn? I'm any case welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-06-30T12:25:56.390,27
2218,1229,0,That point is important but difficult to capture on this site I fear since it disfavors discussions like this one. Every type named in a declaration should be an interface type not an implementation type. So use List foo not ArrayList foo. A further implication that inheritance should not extend the public (informal) interface of a class. If you need to add a new public method in a subclass extend a formal interface instead and implement that.  Sadly most simple examples of inheritance given to novices break this rule completely.,2017-06-30T12:27:58.777,1293
2224,1255,0,Well I am still a volunteer firefighter; I just let my cert lapse when I had a kid and didn't have time to refresh.  I'm in an engine company so it has never been a big deal.

2225,1254,0,Thanks for the note.  I'll get the hang of this.  :)  1) I remember having difficulty determining exactly where my unit tests were supposed to be uploaded; there's a user folder and an assignment folder and one something's in the wrong place it's hard to just move it.  2) In three years I still haven't found how to get it to accept Type arrayname[] as opposed to Type[] arrayname; students hate losing those two points.  3) Students sometimes have to click around a little to find report details and the UI doesn't always make clear what's clickable.,2017-06-30T12:54:15.450,1564

2233,1262,0,A more useful distinction on the age ranges (please correct me) might be for this question they're at or maybe in the first year of elective subjects. So here you're exposed to a class taking maybe 15 different subjects the older group will be more narrowly focused towards STEM or about to make that transition. I think the questions would benefit from elaboration of each specific target.,2017-06-30T14:02:42.147,41
2234,1279,1,Nice thoughtful answer. Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we year more from you!,2017-06-30T14:20:11.017,27
2235,1263,0,That's fair. Extending my logic above to put kindergarteners into AP English Literature or Calculus-in-3D would clearly be ridiculous. But I have to think that introductory CS isn't beyond most high schoolers. Do I have such a rose-colored memory?,2017-06-30T14:21:09.650,1166
2236,1265,0,Yes the Project GUTS life sciences module centers around building a predator-prey population dynamics model then designing and running their own experiment. It doesn't address that NGSS standard (population traits) specifically but it could be incorporated as an extension of that module. Example: have multiple types of prey with different susceptibilities to predation and see which wins out over time.,2017-06-30T14:32:25.727,1583
2237,1260,0,_@Walfrat: The type of problems used in competitive programming are mostly about algorithm (pick a solution with the time/space complexity that can pass the size of the test case) and some knowledge of the library offered by the language is sometimes needed (time complexity of the built-in data structure). The problems are also usually designed with edge cases or two so it's a nice way to train them to think through them before coding. On the other hand competitive programming places less emphasis on writing maintainable/portable code - which should be taught in a different class.,2017-06-30T14:48:34.587,1584
2238,1272,0,Thank you!  I'm still learning what makes answers valuable.,2017-06-30T14:56:32.317,1564
2239,1260,0,_@nhahtdh Then our author should add that : Training students to resolve problems in a Time Frame with the best time/space complexity compromise. Note that sometimes just translate a given algorithm to C++ solution is not so obvious (dijikstra handle nodes already visited for instances),2017-06-30T15:01:11.437,1375
2240,1272,0,Please also summarize the content of those chapters. The goal is for this answer to be useful even without the link.,2017-06-30T15:01:44.810,58
2241,109,1,Had a rock solid c++ intro/basic/intermediate guy...students from every major school in the area would goto his community college take his classes ... a working program was only 10% of the grade on each assignment.,2017-06-30T15:03:04.430,1297
2244,1265,0,I actually did a summer camp for this - it was quite fun. Let me dig up the links to the projects I created...,2017-06-30T15:12:03.780,919
2245,1265,0,We did three big projects: an [epidemic simulator](http://www.slnova.org/heatheryoung/projects/75279/) an [ecosystem simulator](http://www.slnova.org/heatheryoung/projects/76761/) and a [carbon emissions simulator](http://www.slnova.org/heatheryoung/projects/77179/). I must admit I still work on them occasionally; I enjoy StarLogo Nova.,2017-06-30T15:16:27.267,919
2249,1281,0,I appreciate the perspective of an actual HS teacher here. Thanks for the thorough answer and welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-06-30T16:28:30.437,27
2250,1273,0,One of the most important things I've found for teaching this concept is the idea that you could *want* to restrict access to data or functions.  When we learn coding public is kinda the default way most of us think.  You have to realize there's value in constraining your options before you can understand why you want private.  I think this series of examples using a wallet is an excellent argument for why sometimes you want constraints.,2017-06-30T16:42:34.430,812
2251,1282,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! What a great question. I hope we'll see more posts from you.,2017-06-30T17:01:21.693,150
2252,1205,4,Generally it's best not to put a summary of the answers in a question. If you think a summary answer would add value feel free to answer your own question instead to allow others to vote on it and edit it separately to your question.,2017-06-30T17:10:29.337,2
2256,453,1,The answer is like most things it depends.  +1 for traversing a tree structure.,2017-07-01T04:31:53.687,1537
2257,47,0,One rarely spits out HTML directly with modern frameworks. More frequently the html is stored in resource files (jsp asp xml etc) and the framework merges the parameters with the resources to produce HTML. It is poor practice to embed HTML in your application code.,2017-07-01T04:40:49.623,1537
2259,1290,1,My focus where would be on a required courses but it would be intersting to see what should be done in each case,2017-07-01T08:49:43.393,118
2260,1246,0,I cannot express enough how useful this is. Thanks. (I will probably accept this soon),2017-07-01T08:52:26.460,150
2261,1290,0,I've be told a case of a college student whose parents forced her to study CS (they thouh she would become rich this way) she pretty much hated the course and had a very low performance but no teacher interviwed in this situaton,2017-07-01T09:06:13.273,118
2262,1290,1,_@Safirah I would turn this into only one of the two questions and also ask the second question.  (required classes vs unrequired classes). This will give the site the value of two focused questions and will also help you to get better answers.,2017-07-01T10:57:04.593,27
2263,1291,2,Hi Dave. Thanks for contributing and welcome to [cseducators.se]! Right now this is a bit of an *answer stub*. Would you mind editing your answer here and including just a little bit more information about those two links?,2017-07-01T11:37:43.800,27
2264,1291,2,Link answers are very useful but they can be far more useful if you include  *in your answer* what precisely those links have which answers the question.,2017-07-01T11:45:41.517,150
2265,395,1,I really like your distance to tower concept to illustrate a (straight line distance) heuristic,2017-07-01T13:43:00.413,916
2269,1260,0,Please feel free to continue your discussion of competitive programming skills [in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/61419/discussion-on-question-by-yashas-how-to-teach-competitive-programming).,2017-07-01T14:55:37.937,58
2270,1126,0,Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/61420/discussion-on-question-by-ellen-spertus-how-to-prepare-students-for-bias-in-indu).,2017-07-01T15:33:31.530,58
2271,1246,0,Ultimately it's all about security.  All the examples above has to do with security and the consequences of such can use the same framework.  If your VISA card is made public I don't think it takes a lot of imagination to know how bad that really is so likewise something like a bank_balance variable must definitely be extremely limited.  You cannot just have any random objects modify it outside of specific withdraw() and deposit() methods.  Likewise a bank teller and an ATM are under the authorized_entity environment and will probably have similar checks for withdraw() and deposit().,2017-07-01T15:45:22.280,1285
2272,1279,0,Yes sadly _tenure is all_ for young faculty. Some things that are very interesting but not highly valued by your colleagues should probably be avoided (or minimized) until you grasp the Holy Grail. I've had to push students away from one of my main interests for this reason. Learn to play Goalie before you try to become the Star Forward.,2017-07-01T16:00:01.517,1293
2273,432,0,Sounds like a Pedagogical Pattern actually. Great name for it too. Head It Off At The Pass. Love it.,2017-07-01T16:04:22.020,1293
2274,1143,0,Is there a reason you're still teaching JSP when it's really been hugely declining in popularity and relevance over the last ten years? Why aren't you teaching something similar to what would be used on a new project in industry - MVC is *not* that hard a concept to understand? I'd also echo the comments suggesting teaching prepared statements from the start.,2017-07-01T16:12:27.630,916
2275,1143,1,_@AdamWilliams Unfortunately It's the school curriculum. It might be changing this year (finally!)...,2017-07-01T16:16:31.437,150
2276,84,0,These sort of constrained problems can be great seminar and assignment submission but I'd caution you against assigning too many of these sort of problems in the context of a time-pressured exam. You'll filter not for those who are able to do this sort of abstract thinking but for those who happen to see the solution more quickly and those who are less 'anxious' about solving problems under pressure.,2017-07-01T16:17:17.807,916
2278,432,0,See the book [Pedagogical Patterns: Advice for Educators](https://www.amazon.com/Pedagogical-Patterns-Educators-Joseph-Bergin/dp/1479171824) for a moderately complete view though there is an international ongoing effort. [Joseph Bergin's website](http://csis.pace.edu/~bergin) has a lot of the material. I have a connection to this group. -- OOPS. I was responding to a question now withdrawn.,2017-07-01T16:28:07.377,1293
2279,1299,3,Presumably you're not interested in discussing the the interpretation of functions in functional programming where functions generally **don't** have side effects and act like functions in mathematics? Or would this be something you'd be interested in discussing in an answer?,2017-07-01T17:05:11.393,2
2280,1277,0,Those three are very different to each other. Robocode is great for AI-like courses Code Jam is much more algorithms oriented and as for KoTH - I assume that whoever writes a tight insert-loop soonest wins?,2017-07-01T17:07:36.403,913
2281,1299,1,_@Aurora0001 I think the example I give demonstrates a difference between math and CS functions even in a functional paradigm. My question is about teaching programming to novices some of whom do learn CS in a primarily functional paradigm especially CS newcomers in an undergraduate Matlab-based course.,2017-07-01T17:08:24.713,765
2282,1262,0,_@nocomprende The NCBI activity is in a CS Principles curriculum implemented in ~1000 US high schools.,2017-07-01T17:10:03.553,765
2284,1301,0,could you please specify in which languages `3.` is an integer?,2017-07-01T17:32:53.463,150
2285,1301,0,In Python for example `3.` is `float` but is mathematically an integer,2017-07-01T17:33:53.793,765
2288,1299,0,The floor function f has f(3.1)=f(3.2)=3 but each argument has one result. In contrast the random number generator rand(3.1) is sometimes 0.1 and other time 0.2. It is not a mathematical function. There are other differences. Math functions specify a mapping without an inherent procedure so you cannot talk about the time complexity of a math function. A CS function is a procedure to be executed without necessarily producing a mapping because some arguments may result in an infinite loop.,2017-07-01T18:02:58.270,765
2289,1297,2,I've always been surprised that students don't call me a goofy zealot on course evaluations.,2017-07-01T18:10:29.563,283
2290,1299,0,my apologies I read `round` instead of `rand`.,2017-07-01T18:22:51.190,150
2291,1305,1,uniqueness of result is not implied. In fact just plot $x = 16y^2$ and you'll see multi-valued results.,2017-07-01T18:24:23.660,150
2292,1306,0,That's a clever little example.  :)  Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-07-01T18:40:15.167,27
2295,1302,2,If you have enough bandwidth for a voice channel you might also be able to do distributed (not face to face) pairing. I struggled with that for years. While it isn't your specific need some here may have suggestions. It would enable home schoolers as well as those students out for illness or otherwise.,2017-07-01T19:19:13.723,1293
2296,1309,0,Java ain't Algebra is the key point. A computer program (at least in the procedural languages you are likely to teach first in CS) is a description of an algorithm not a collection of mathematical equations. You won't find a cookery recipe that tells you how to make a pizza just by saying pizza = dough + toppings. Of course an algorithm (or a recipe) may contain *logical tests* - for example if (dough == black and smoking) then pizza is overcooked (!!),2017-07-01T19:23:57.500,1352
2297,1301,0,In math Integer and Real are infinite sets. `int` and `float` are vanishingly small (i.e. finite) subsets of those infinite sets. The language designer makes a choice about which values are most useful to the programmer.,2017-07-01T19:26:06.503,1293
2298,1311,4,Always glad to see more teachers here. Welcome to [cseducators.se]! I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-07-01T19:32:55.583,27
2299,1296,1,This reminds me of my college days learning PASCAL. Or my years of programming in BASIC. :P,2017-07-01T19:34:07.383,27
2300,1297,0,`What else would you call it when putting together words and symbols enables you to control powerful entities`  [quaternary sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_sector_of_the_economy)? ;),2017-07-01T19:43:07.747,757
2301,1312,3,Nonsense. Teachers are not idiots. You don't need to be actively involved to keep up with an evolving topic.,2017-07-01T19:48:36.183,124
2302,1097,0,When I have tried having students submit their own tests they have been of very low quality in my experience. Often they are testing tiny corner cases which where there was some issue in the original spec.  It's VERY hard to write specs where you cover every possible corner case particular when it comes to things like what happens when integers overflow or code runs out of memory.,2017-07-01T19:53:08.857,1611
2303,1305,1,I was writing about functions. Your example is an equation (a relation). $f(y) = 16y^2$ is single valued. But yes the equation has multiple solutions. That isn't the same thing. And of course the unique result (range value) of a function could be a set. But still unique. Am I missing something? (deleted and re-entered since I can't edit my earlier error.),2017-07-01T20:00:55.660,1293
2304,1267,0,It's just the payout minus the commission: so 900 for the first day.,2017-07-01T21:23:35.510,1571
2305,1267,0,So on the second day he would earn \$1800 but have to pay \$200?,2017-07-01T21:25:11.270,27
2306,1310,1,Re a variable is a representative for some value - so is a constant which is the opposite of a variable.,2017-07-01T21:40:16.000,1612
2307,1310,0,Yes of course @alancalvitti but as the discussion was about variables I didn't give a fuller exposition. In some ways a constant is more like a math variable than a variable is though that might just confuse the situation for students rather than clarify it.,2017-07-01T21:43:22.927,1293
2308,1312,0,I think you're over-generalizing -- while I don't doubt that some schools are out-of-date it seems a stretch to claim they're all that way. It might even be the other way around sometimes: if teachers are doing cutting-edge research on various topics (databases 3d printing data visualization machine learning...) it's entirely possible they'd be more prepared to predict and teach future trends vs teachers from industry. For example functional programming used to be purely academic but is practically mainstream now; FRP is starting to become influential (see react & related frameworks)...,2017-07-01T21:55:12.533,732
2309,1290,0,[This](https://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/) and [this](http://peripateticaxiom.blogspot.be/2007/02/fizzbuzz.html) might be of interest.,2017-07-01T22:14:50.443,1613
2310,1292,1,At my university a lot of unrelated majors had CS 1 as a required class (instead of the more useful CS for Sciences). So the class was a huge lecture with about 75% CS majors and 25% other but was taught strictly as a foundation for the CS students. There were a lot of people who were great at their actual field but spent all their time studying to get a C in CS in a class that really isn't all that useful as a standalone.,2017-07-01T22:15:40.483,1407
2311,1328,0,Usually my lab specifications put plenty of cs meat into the core assignment itself.  Is this for free-choice or unguided projects?,2017-07-01T22:56:37.087,27
2312,1328,0,I've observed the problem in projects and problems that have small and large opportunity for student-direction. Even when the student deliverable is well-constrained I've seen high- and low-achieving students express anxiety around leaving a sprite costume unfinished or less than perfect.,2017-07-01T23:03:33.043,765
2313,1329,3,Be aware that adding features not asked for can get you fired in the real world. If the assignment is to be creative then it isn't an issue but note that extra code is code that (a) needs to be maintained in perpetuity (almost) and (b) may introduce bugs into the features that are required. So if you are asked to do X then do X as well as you can and seek guidance before you decide to do Y also.,2017-07-01T23:03:41.363,1293
2314,1329,0,_@Buffy sure. I guess I meant it as in the classroom when you are still learning putting extra effort in is by no means a bad thing.,2017-07-01T23:06:15.270,919
2315,1327,0,Is a simple port scan with no further action illegal?,2017-07-01T23:06:47.803,58
2316,1311,2,I mean what is wrong with `:=` ?????,2017-07-01T23:08:12.347,856
2317,1329,1,Also be careful what you encourage in your golf game. Shortest code isn't necessarily the best. Most readable code best variable and method names etc would be encouraged pretty much universally but shortness at the expense of maintainability is a problem not a feature. Most comments is bad code that doesn't need any comments is good. Most tests could be good or bad depending but just the count is less valuable than the coverage. Best coverage in tests - good.,2017-07-01T23:09:21.193,1293
2318,1329,0,If I generalize your answer a bit it is definitely a positive thing. But the teacher needs to be clear on what is valued and what is problematic. So your golf game wins with the right rules. Extra effort good. Maintain balance better. Rabbit holes bad. When you are doing programming for another (a teacher or boss) you work to their standard. When you write for  yourself be as creative as balance and constraint will allow.,2017-07-01T23:12:56.877,1293
2319,1329,0,_@Buffy I assume that the teacher has enough discretion to properly carry out these challenges/leaderboards. Of course there is too much of a good thing.,2017-07-01T23:16:46.997,919
2320,1329,0,Oh if every student were like you teaching would be so good. But so hard. We (teachers) would never get any sleep just keeping up.,2017-07-01T23:19:34.190,1293
2321,1329,0,_@Buffy thank you but not quite true I think =) There's tons of things I still have to learn. I hope my edit properly conveys what you were trying to say.,2017-07-01T23:27:05.170,919
2322,1329,0,Lots of things we _all_ need to learn but the discussion is getting too long. Keep on keepin' on.,2017-07-01T23:41:26.243,1293
2323,1327,1,_@thesecretmaster. Yes in some places no in others but it can depend I'm pretty sure on how much of a pain a prosecutor wants to inflict on your poor self.,2017-07-02T00:40:35.207,1293
2326,1343,2,That's a very good point (and a nice first post in our community). Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-02T00:46:44.190,27
2330,1300,27,They aren't three meanings of equality.  They are three meanings of the _symbol_ `=`.  Many symbols are used for different meanings especially in different contexts; this is one of them.  For example `joe@yahoo.com` and `12 @ $1.25` mean different things though both use the symbol `@`.  The only problem I can see is if an instructor _started_ the misinterpretation by saying that something like `R = A + B` is an _equation_ or maybe this means R _is equal to_  A + B and then later corrected that to explain about variables and assignment.,2017-07-02T01:14:47.897,1301
2340,1331,10,I don't know how many times I've seen the IP address compared to a phone number with the DNS being the phone book. To add ports to that just add extensions to the phone number. Extensions that are standardized so you always know which extension to connect to for some department. The web department is normally extension 80 the email department uses extension 25. If you have an encrypted phone then you used different extensions.,2017-07-02T03:13:55.247,104
2344,1085,0,Isn't disclosure to the controlling institution of a vulnerability required by ethics?,2017-07-02T03:25:38.060,765
2345,1340,0,Seats! Love it. The person in the seat is like the program registered with the OS to listen at that port. The analogy gets at the idea that programs at a port may or may not be the port's usual ilstener (students sit in the wrong seat) might not be running (absent student) and that programs might have assumptions they make about incoming packets. If a love note for Barb at 121:2 is sent to Alice at 121:1 who knows what Alice will do with it? Ignore it? Return receipt reporting incorrect delivery? Respond in a way that noone who knows Alice would have expected?,2017-07-02T04:13:07.660,765
2346,1341,0,Concurring: port is the apartment number not the apartment. The apartment dweller has to do something with the delivered mail akin to the program listening at that port. My success with the apartment building:number::IP:port analogy increased when I started showing pictures of a bank of mailboxes: https://sep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-14044557065217/16-door-cluster-mailbox-sandstone-182.jpg,2017-07-02T04:17:46.863,765

2348,1310,0,I think the difference between a variable in algebra and a variable in CS deserves its own question and crows sourcing of ideas about how to clarify the difference for students.,2017-07-02T04:52:08.927,765
2349,1309,0,Selecting as the answer because the link to Roger's lesson is helpful mutating/constraining are nice terms to introduce and because I think the claim of early and repeatedly is correct and backed by your anecdotal data. I do think it should be studied and submitted to a peer reviewed journal as more systematically collected results might violate our shared intuition and anecdotal observations. Without real data it feels odd to pick an answer but I wager yours is correct including the insightful observation that confusion is delayed seeping and hard for students to pinpoint.,2017-07-02T05:01:19.470,765
2350,1346,3,Very interesting ideas. Welcome to [cseducators.se] and I hope we hear more from you!,2017-07-02T05:43:16.200,27
2351,1310,0,I actually can't think of any common languages where `3 == 3.0` would evaluate to false. Not that I know every common language but it can't be all _that_ common can it?.,2017-07-02T07:04:18.943,1357
2353,1310,0,Hmmm. @DavidZ. Sorry just me being too literal minded. I changed the example. Hopefully correct now.,2017-07-02T08:12:10.927,1293
2354,1305,2,_@nocomprende I think that is a good thing. In fact I think that early CS education puts far too much stress on mathematical examples. That seems to be a consequence of trying to teach the primitives (int float ...) earlier than they need to be taught. There are exceptions of course.,2017-07-02T09:21:24.180,1293
2355,1310,0,_@Buffy Sure I'll take your word for this one. :-) (The point is clearer now anyway),2017-07-02T09:28:34.307,1357
2356,1317,2,+1 for There is no particular reason to assume that any given symbol used in a programming language needs to have any specific semantics. Just point them to some of the languages used on the codegolf stackexchage.,2017-07-02T09:41:22.760,1623
2357,1214,0,A note about the blog. Your definition of open-source is inaccurate. Please read the open-source definition then note that the set of Open Source software is almost identical to the set of Free Software then read the Free Software definition then read the Open Source definition again. ( The name Open Source is misleading  I just remember Open Source ??? Free Software. And Free Software is software with the 4 freedoms. Open Source also has these freedoms but it is not obvious from the name. Not all software with source available is Open Source.),2017-07-02T09:50:09.617,204
2358,1331,6,Analogies are like shoes ... they do not always fit perfectly.,2017-07-02T10:43:58.000,1131
2359,1341,0,Why can we ping only houses not appartments? In other words a good metaphor would need good counterparts for TCP vs. UDP vs. IP. To begin with there is in principle no relation between UDP port x and TCP port x (even if e.g. DNS uses both UDP port 53 and TCP 53); even the fact that their number ranges are the same is not a principal necessity. My point is: Why try to use a metaphor at all to cover every aspect and detail when pairs of numbers are a simple concept?,2017-07-02T10:51:04.363,1131
2360,1079,0,is this a sufficient message to impart? Sufficient for _what_? What is it that you hope to achieve with this lecture?,2017-07-02T11:26:06.937,154
2361,1290,0,_@BobJarvis I'm talking about a highschool course not just a subject this is the student (or his parents) enrolled him in it.,2017-07-02T11:55:27.530,118
2362,1300,0,It doesn't directly answer your question so I'm putting this as a comment. Read the assignment operator as becomes equal to. In some programming languages the := operator is used to disambiguate the symbolism.,2017-07-02T12:26:28.983,1537
2363,1310,1,Mistaking rounding error for an issue with the intent of the equivalence operator could cause more confusion.  The == means the same as the algebraic = but the unequaled being reported is a function of rounding error inherent in representing decimal fractions in a binary forum. Like fractions of 9 in base 10 many fractions of 10 are infinitely repeating series in base 2,2017-07-02T12:32:45.223,1537
2365,1244,0,_@RyanNutt: I said in Java `private`s *are* visible to other objects and my example demonstrates that. I never said anything about classes. The fact that objects cannot access the private representation of *any* other objects is one of the fundamental differences between objects and abstract data types (where instances of the same ADT *can* inspect each other's private representation). In your example both objects are instances of the type `Human` so they *should* be able to read each other's minds according to the rules of ADTs (e.g. like in Java) but not according to the rules of ?€?,2017-07-02T13:20:16.690,945
2366,1244,0,?€? of objects (e.g. like in Ruby). So your example is a good example of object-oriented encapsulation as employed in Ruby but it is not a good example of ADT-oriented encapsulation as employed in Java since in your example the objects cannot inspect each other's representation even though they would be able to in Java.,2017-07-02T13:23:21.087,945
2367,1348,1,That's a nice point. Welcome to [cseducators.se] - I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-07-02T13:32:12.240,27
2368,1348,0,I've just noticed @Gypsy-Spellweaver 's comment to the original question and realised that my answer is much the same.,2017-07-02T13:45:02.503,1628
2369,1350,0,Hi Stilez! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is an interesting take on the problem thanks for sharing it.,2017-07-02T13:46:46.530,58
2371,1351,0,Not only could you write a pretty good one yourself but you'd also not have to grade it. The purpose of the teacher in the classroom is to teach. If they can accept that then their on the road to learning.,2017-07-02T13:56:16.443,104
2372,1340,0,_@BennettBrown That's even better. Bob and Sue switched seats because there's a substitute and now Bob doesn't get his message.,2017-07-02T14:33:45.777,30
2373,785,0,Add 4.5. What would _you_ do to improve the course/situation.,2017-07-02T14:48:24.027,1293
2374,1354,0,Is there too much emphasis generally on Deliver the Material? Is there another way? Wikipedia generally has all the content.,2017-07-02T14:55:16.983,1293
2378,1354,0,_@Buffy I don't know about your experiences but I would **not** recommend learning from a Wikipedia article; they never seem to be pitched at the right level for learning a topic more an encyclopaedic reference. I honestly can't say whether covering all the material should be a requirement but it's often challenging to find a resource that teaches the topic you want to learn without assuming you know something that you don't.,2017-07-02T15:00:11.657,2
2379,1349,1,Interest alone isn't enough. I once got a C in a graduate math course (essentially a failing grade) though I had interest and skill. The prof just never got through to me in any way at any time. I don't recall over all these years whether that was a general opinion of my classmates.,2017-07-02T15:02:05.560,1293
2381,1354,0,Agreed. So perhaps we agree that it isn't really about content but about something at a higher level. I've found wikipedia to be pretty good if I'm willing to click a lot. But I'm not a young learner. Still I don't think content is king no matter where it comes from. (But don't let me put words in your mouth.) When I was a new teacher I know I emphasized content too much.,2017-07-02T15:04:29.567,1293
2382,1349,0,_@Buffy What I was trying to state is that in my opinion interest alone is enough reason (for a student) to try to get taught by somebody (e.g. by taking a course on that topic).,2017-07-02T15:06:32.823,793
2384,1354,0,_@Buffy Whether content is king is an interesting question in its own right (and I'd encourage you to ask that as a question!) but I would say that if you haven't taught it a lot of students won't know what you expect them to unless you provide specific resources showing them what they need to know. I think that it's probably unrealistic to not teach all the content in the course and expect them to know it although that might be a little cynical?€?but introducing everything that they should know would seem wise to me.,2017-07-02T15:07:30.600,2
2385,1349,0,Yes I agree but something is still missing. I'm more focused on what the instructor can do however so that I can nurture that interest into learning.  The student can try but I have to deliver. Hmmm. Remember the movie Stand And Deliver? Jaime Escalante did his part.,2017-07-02T15:11:09.500,1293
2387,1354,0,Exactly but how do I teach it? I gave up on lecture as my main vehicle more and more as I grew older (I hope better). Ref if you haven't taught it in your note.,2017-07-02T15:14:39.080,1293
2389,1351,1,*The purpose of programming exercises isn't to produce a program but to produce learning.*  I need to tell my students this more often.,2017-07-02T15:31:43.627,1635
2392,1353,1,This seems confusing. If a sea port like Liverpool is analogous to anything in networking I would expect it to be an interface rather than a port.,2017-07-02T15:43:22.247,1636
2396,1311,0,Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/61444/discussion-on-answer-by-chris-jefferson-teaching-math-equality-vs-cs-assignm).,2017-07-02T16:27:25.367,58
2397,1299,2,but it is not a mathematical function because it has multiple possible return values for a given argument. Has it? if you take the whole state of the computer and recreate it exactly the same way it would again give the exact same result. The state of the computer is an implicit input to this function one that is often forgotten.,2017-07-02T16:52:53.903,1086
2399,1312,0,Most teaching organisations (in the UK I don't know about anywhere else) are forced to operate within the pace of continuous change. There's no reason why some academics teachers or even students can't be at least as up to date (if not more so) than some working in industry.,2017-07-02T17:16:53.913,674
2400,1357,0,Maybe you could expand that to a full answer. Maybe you are saying it is just an (absolute?) constraint. Or not?,2017-07-02T17:38:22.703,1293
2401,1359,0,But is it efficient at the cost of effectiveness? Socrates didn't need efficiency. How much does that need overpower all else possibly to the detriment of the learner.,2017-07-02T18:26:09.493,1293
2403,1357,0,I'm more interested in _your_ goals and how you think they balance.,2017-07-02T18:27:22.963,1293
2404,1359,1,_@Buffy Efficiency in that you could spend years working through slowly discovering each result one by one but it's inefficient in terms of cost and time (as much as learning is a great thing some people don't want to dedicate a life to academia). Whether the priority of efficiency is a good thing in society is a question I cannot answer particularly not on a CS Education site... It's a far more complex philosophical idea that I don't really know the answer to.,2017-07-02T18:30:53.863,2
2405,1359,2,To twist the question a bit what is it that you want for your students primarily; that they _know_ or that they _can do_. Not quite the same and content aids one more than the other. If I know 3 data structures in Java can I grok the others on a need to know basis? So is it better to see more or better to work with what I have seen?  And I'm pretty sure the answer is different in CS than in other fields. And possibly not the same if the person is headed to grad school vs a job,2017-07-02T18:34:43.980,1293
2408,1360,0,In the middle you say Instill in your students the desire to help other... have you ideas about how I can scale that even if only a bit. Your examples were mostly one to one. Can you think of ways to scale it say to 3 or five. This is the kind of thing I think can be a lego block to build a solution. Do you have thoughts about making groups work for student X and Y above? And deep even if off the cuff,2017-07-02T19:16:30.090,1293
2409,1361,0,If I interpret presentation as content delivery (yes not your words) would you value presentation over practice or the other way round?,2017-07-02T19:22:54.640,1293
2410,1361,1,_@Buffy yes I think presentation would be content delivery that makes sense. And I think I would value presentation over practice though only just. It is hard to practice what you do not know but once you know it you must practice it.,2017-07-02T19:28:18.693,919
2411,1349,0,_@Buffy I see... I think the other answers cover your requirements way better than my answer does. Not my best one apparently.,2017-07-02T19:31:08.077,793
2412,1360,1,_@Buffy All I can offer is ideas. You have to build it yourself ultimately and develop something that works(which means trying things out there is no short term solution/quick fix). I'll add something about what I think will help students work in groups more effectively than what I have experienced in my own education but ultimately it is all anecdotal you will have to develop a living breathing solution that evolves and works for you(there are no cookie cutter solutions. This problem is fundamental to humans if not life itself).,2017-07-02T19:36:23.757,1638
2413,1331,0,The apartment street address vs. apartment number is the analogy I use and it seems to work. Anything could work though - buildings and room numbers classrooms and seats pbx and extensions (this may add confusion) - as long as it references one destination with service dependent on who is contacted at that destination,2017-07-02T19:41:15.113,662
2414,1360,0,The general can emerge from the specific I think. But the struggle takes a lot of work - and minds.,2017-07-02T19:50:03.027,1293
2415,1361,1,I might switch them. I usually learn a new language by working in it not reading (very much) about it. Can the knowledge emerge from the practice? Preference is important of course but I'm going to take a wild stab and guess you aren't a typical student in your age cohort. I can't imagine my grandson writing like you do - only a bit younger. Your feedback here is as real as it gets.,2017-07-02T19:54:50.090,1293
2416,1289,0,Thank you for the explanation. When I make a game in Java I find myself unwinding the event mechanism so all my handlers end up setting boolean variables. Then the code looks like this: `mousePressed { mouseDown = true;} mouseReleased {mouseDown = false;}` and in the game loop I have an if statement that does something based on the variable. Am I doing it wrong? This is for a simulation-style game like a jumping game.,2017-07-02T20:08:22.557,587
2419,1300,2,By the way the *The math statement is a constraining assertion restricting x to the set {01}* is not accurate. It is correct if we know that x belongs to the set of Integers or the Reals or the Complex numbers. But there are other sets (with a definition of multiplication) where the equation `x=x*x` has different (less or more) solutions.,2017-07-02T21:17:46.310,1640
2420,1359,0,_@Buffy Doesn't that depend on the course? The primary goal for some courses might be to teach applied skills (by the end of this course you should know how to work as a team and use source control to write software to control robots that open doors) while other courses might focus on practical knowledge (you'll learn about eight different data structures and how they work) foundational knowledge (you'll learn about these types of mathematics and proofs) or even to give students an overview of topics in a particular subfield so they know what's out there. There's no one answer.,2017-07-02T21:40:29.290,1642
2421,1300,0,In the R statistical programming language it's typical to use `x <- 5` for assignment rather than `y = 5`; and to use `x == y` for testing equality.,2017-07-02T22:01:59.930,1367
2422,1267,0,Exactly. Have them turn it into a pair of formulas for each day with subscripted variables.  Then we start writing code and see that we'd end up with 60-odd variables. Introduce lists as a way of having variables with subscripts.   Then build up lists manually a few times and introduce them to for loops.   Then at the end you can use an if outside the loop to check the final values.   Lists for loops and if statements. For my non-majors class it takes three 70-minute classes to get through but it presents a coherent (if fanciful) problem to motivate them.,2017-07-02T22:06:45.897,1571
2423,1363,0,My guess is that it depends on how the instructor/text describes negative indexing. If students understand that it's just syntactic sugar I wouldn't expect it to affect their model.,2017-07-02T22:30:39.870,283
2425,1300,2,In mathematics $x=x^2$ is a statement which can be true or false depending on $x$ quite similarly to your second Python example.,2017-07-02T22:51:20.493,1645
2426,1364,0,How do you and others react to the statement that the most important part of education is the relationship between a student and a professor. What are the consequences of accepting or rejecting that view for society?,2017-07-03T00:01:51.773,1293
2427,1365,1,I think your instinct to give students a high level model for how data are stored in memory is in line with my assertion that most teachers of entry CS do not teach low-level ideas with much breadth or depth. I am saying that students nevertheless construct a model for howe a computer works at some low level and that their model has implications later on in their education.,2017-07-03T00:51:55.947,765
2430,1289,0,As with so much in computer programming  it depends.  A lot of simulations depend on a heartbeat. It is perfectly fine for the event to set the stage for the next heartbeat.  Another pattern you may see is when an event submits another event back to the queue - the mouse release event may get rebroadcast as a menu event  such as File Save.,2017-07-03T01:56:11.530,1537
2431,302,0,If possible please reference the handful of articles you refer to or a review of lit. If a user finds this question in a search the links are very useful to them.,2017-07-03T02:01:37.763,765
2432,260,0,I agree: start students with a minimal skeleton of working HTML. They can load the local file in their browser and see the effect of saved changes by refreshing the browser. But I precede the skeleton with an overview of server/client and HTML/CSS/JS. I immediately follow the skeleton by adding an `<h1>`  element and then modify the start tag with `style=color: #ff00ff;` and teach inline CSS reinforcing hex RGB which I taught earlier in a different context.,2017-07-03T02:38:19.230,765
2433,211,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-array-indexes-start-with-0-zero-in-many-programming-languages describes multiple reasons for 0 indexing including last_index - first_index should be length_of_array as well as your pointer argument.,2017-07-03T03:54:17.017,765
2434,1371,0,Students never just absrob new material. They always incorporate new ideas into models they already have constructed. Students do not abandon models they have already adopted even if they are told the model is wrong. This is constructivism. See National Research Council. (2000). How People Learn. If negative indexing makes people start out by envisioning a circular/modulus structure it is presumed to affect later learning.,2017-07-03T04:02:41.677,765
2435,1371,1,Thank you for speculating @BenI ! We do have some evidence to go on; mental models of intro CS students have been studied including arrays and lists in particular. See Sodol et al. (2009). http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lsudol/lsudol_p28.pdf,2017-07-03T04:03:02.790,765
2436,1126,2,Frieze and Quesenberry argue in *Kicking Butt in CS* (2015) that the key reforms at Carnegie Mellon (which is achieving even M/F ratios in CS major and in career persistence) were abandoning difference theories (backing off the belief that different ideas appeal to men vs. women) in favor of valuing diverse people and people with diverse interests and raising awareness of bias.,2017-07-03T04:21:48.653,765
2437,1296,3,Don't teach them the language framework or shiny new gizmo. Also don't teach them any development model or workflow process. Rather teach them to explore and learn the language framework or other tool. If they can learn how to learn their skills will never be _out of date_ even when AI and quantum computing blend to produce SkyNet. The last time I learned a new language it took me 5 days to be job ready including passing the hiring exam with the best code they'd seen. Teach skills not facts.,2017-07-03T04:25:15.740,104
2438,1134,1,In addition to using your network to find out a company's reputation I think it important to pass each student **individually** from you as a mentor to their next mentor in the field. Bill Massey describes Black mentor networks as playing a key role in Bell Lab's success producing so many highly successful Black STEM professors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS3gFg3AMFA . HS teachers need to identify post-secondary mentors for their top students from under-represented groups.

2439,1363,0,[this question](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1030/transition-from-java-to-python) might be of interest to you,2017-07-03T05:23:42.363,150
2440,1300,0,There is also the `=` of Prolog for unification for even more confusion!,2017-07-03T06:56:47.720,268
2441,1309,0,_@BennettBrown While teaching it early is essential this is certainly not  a CS problem. The inability to grasp the different uses of = even just within mathematics is a huge problem that students struggle with. There are actually quite a few papers written on this (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3374577/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/30034852 ),2017-07-03T08:36:26.447,1393
2443,1356,0,It does depend at what level you're teaching. A good proportion of the workforce (even in developed countries) are applying technology (they call them trades) in a static framework. Even in technical subjects this is true - do you want your lab tech. running consistent and repeatable tests or do you want them making tweaks to the machine calibration every weekend?,2017-07-03T09:11:46.743,41
2445,1352,3,It's also important not to assume that a student won't know the answer to supposedly easy question they won't know the answer to a supposedly hard question. Taking your example I can never remember which of the many O(n^2) algorithms happens to be called bubble sort but I know about when quicksort will become slow and different mitigation strategies. Personally I'm always weak with memorizing definitions but find reasoning easy once given the definitions easy while many teachers seem to assume that somebody who doesn't even know the definition by heart won't be able to apply it either.,2017-07-03T10:17:54.060,839
2447,1376,0,That's not how pair programming works. It does have a confusing name but you can read the tag wiki or go to the wikipedia page.,2017-07-03T11:24:36.507,150
2448,1376,0,Agreed but the question was about how to adapt pair programming to get students to collaborate side by side effectively. For pair programming to work you need two motivated well behaved individuals who are competent and confident in programming. That's not always the case in a classroom.,2017-07-03T11:29:43.123,674
2449,1376,2,But pair programming is not about 2 people writing code on a computer at the same time. That's why I said that comment.,2017-07-03T11:33:45.193,150
2450,1353,1,I could see this going badly in parts of the US where some students may be only dimly aware that there are such things as oceans (or other countries),2017-07-03T11:36:59.917,1357
2451,1365,1,_@BennettBrown I'm wondering if you think that it is important for the students to have an accurate or any particular model. Is it important to you that beginners learn low-level ideas early on?,2017-07-03T11:45:31.013,1293
2452,1376,0,Hmmm. @ItamarG3. Pairing IS about 2 people on one computer even if distributed. Here is a pretty fair description from [the source](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing). Wikipedia has an article also. I don't avoid it I embrace it at any level.,2017-07-03T12:08:23.143,1293
2455,1377,0,Might work. Might fail. Depends on how much experience the students have.,2017-07-03T12:24:36.263,150
2458,1358,0,_@nocomprende Do you and your colleagues find their input helpful?,2017-07-03T12:35:43.800,283
2462,1373,0,Lambda expressions is a big topic and many features were added that interact with each other (functional interfaces for example) Are you focused on just the narrow question as stated or the whole shebang?

2470,1352,1,*when and why an insertion sort algorithm might be more suitable than a bubble sort.*  Isn't that kind of backwards?  insertion-sort performs better than bubble-sort for almost everything so the interesting / challenging question is when you'd ever choose bubble-sort.  (Probably never unless your choices are limited to insert vs. bubble).  Personally I find insertion-sort really easy and sensible to think about so it wins lot on ease of implementation if you're considering that.,2017-07-03T13:10:46.297,1654

2475,1233,0,The existence of this website might change the answer. As a non-computer scientist who nevertheless teaches CS I think the only reason I would join SIGCSE would be for the community to bounce teaching ideas off (whereas I am a member of the math versions because I feel like I should support them as a professional mathematician).

Great was my dismay when on chapter 3 (like a hundred pages in) the book says to paraphrase now we get into python in-depth. But anyway maybe that's just me.,2017-07-03T14:07:30.317,919

2479,1380,0,Recursion is not a language specific concept. Recursion in java is like recursion in any other procedural language. Have them write a method to compute factorials as a classical first example. For kicks have him write a recursive tree walker to display a directory structure and then componentize it by separating the generic tree walker code from the visitor that operates on the directory structure,2017-07-03T14:24:50.767,1537

2493,1371,1,Upon reflection I actually think that constructivism itself may not be quite right. We know that the brain utilizes prior patterns when it encodes new patterns but constructivism is simply an observation that even though the student engages in code-switching this does not intrinsically mean that they have migrated to a *better* representation. They are able to re-encoding their flat representation into a pancake a sphere a tube a dome etc; they simply chose the wrong new representation. Thus we must take care in presenting new patterns to try to maximize the utility of re-encodings.,2017-07-03T15:11:48.763,27

2498,1385,1,One question that might be worth asking in your initial survey is what times the student thinks they'll be generally available to work on their homework (since students have different obligations and may be unavailable at a particular day/time). Pair programming goes much more smoothly if the pair can actually meet in person so it might help to explicitly try and facilitate that.,2017-07-03T15:19:04.337,732

2504,1388,0,It sounds like your students don't sit at one screen with one driving and the other navigating (the classic version) but something different. Can you spell out the scenario a bit? Thanks in advance.,2017-07-03T15:58:06.900,1293
2505,1388,0,_@Buffy what students do is like this: One writes code the other sits next to the first one and reviews it **as it's being written**. With that in mind I hope my answer makes more sense.,2017-07-03T16:03:07.820,150
2506,1388,1,Closer to the standard then. But if I'm navigating I constantly make comments about variable names maybe or structure or needed tests. Sometimes just to remind the driver of past decisions. The advantage of two is partly that the driver takes a microscopic view of the problem but the navigator with less responsibility takes a wider overall view. This has been observed to emerge in practice and doesn't need to be taught. But there should be a continuing conversation so that the navigator doesn't take the narrow view also. If the driver gets stuck they should switch roles.,2017-07-03T16:11:20.760,1293
2507,1387,0,It's not an axiomatic constraint.  I can very well stipulate in a mathematics context that $x=x^2$ is False.,2017-07-03T16:19:12.777,1661

2509,1387,0,For instance suppose one wants to prove that If $x \in \{01\}$ then $x=x^2$ one could set out to prove the contrapositive:  Suppose that it is not the case that $x=x^2$ then $x^2-x=0$ is False so $x(x-1)=0$ is False so $x-1=0$ $x=0$ are False therefore $x \in \{01\}$ is False.,2017-07-03T16:24:06.867,1661
2510,1387,0,Disclaimer:  I am a mathematics educator and when I use the statement $x=x^2$ I very much mean that that is a statement that can either be True or it can be False depending on the value of $x$.,2017-07-03T16:25:57.467,1661

2527,1300,2,From the point of view of a mathematics teacher let me say that the equal sign in mathematics has several context-dependent meanings. Some students do not appreciate the distinctions. Often they only get them only vaguely somewhat like the way you know the idiom of your native language.  But this may be a side issue to teaching programming but it's not like students are equipped by their mathematical backgrounds with a clear understanding of the equal sign. They're inclined to think it's always the same which might be a source of the problem here.,2017-07-03T18:53:23.347,1665

2536,1347,1,A *very* worthy goal!  I thoroughly agree!  The most guaranteed way to accomplish this is to skip the standard classroom lecture model and allow each student to proceed at his or her own pace through the materials *with effective handling of the **barriers to study** in each individual student.*  I think you would be very interested in [Applied Scholastics](http://www.appliedscholastics.org/results/testimonials.html).,2017-07-03T20:37:29.820,1103

2543,1304,1,_@nocomprende actually the effects of words and meanings can be far more subtle than that.  The words YOU FLUNK THE COURSE written on the board (even by a non-faculty prankster before class) *would* have a definite effect on the students.  Practically everyone has *some* degree of irrational identification between the symbols for things and the things themselves.

2549,1311,2,It's unfortunate that someone decided to re-use `=` for assignment in programming but now we are stuck with it.???€? Not really. `=` is only used for assignment in *some* languages not all of them. In fact I wouldn't be surprised to find that these languages are a minority. Most Lisps use an alphanumeric identifier for assignment (e.g. `def` or `set`) Smalltalk originally used `???` and then switched to `:=` only because `???` was not available in the character sets of the early 1980s Algol Jovial Simula Pascal Modula Oberon and many others Beta uses `->` and puts the target at the ?€?,2017-07-04T08:07:57.287,945
2550,1311,0,?€? right gBeta uses `|` and puts the target at the right Prolog and Erlang don't *have* assignment in that sense (they use `=` for pattern unification which is actually somewhat similar to one of the usages in maths) purely functional languages like Haskell Clean Frege Idris Epigram Coq Guru etc don't have this notion of assignment. If you don't like the use of `=` for assignment then just don't use a language that does that. Especially in a CSE setting where the language doesn't matter anyhow and it's all about the concepts.,2017-07-04T08:11:16.793,945
2552,1347,0,I'd have been ready to accept it I think but there wasn't much around in the way of enlightenment for new teachers. In the US at least no one taught new math (there was little CS ed then) teachers how to teach so all we had to go on was what we saw from our own professors. I was also quite isolated in much of my early career teaching in a place off the beaten track with a too-small faculty. There was little opportunity to share experience. It was others who helped me change so I'm trying to give back not be a hard a**.,2017-07-04T08:49:34.053,1293
2553,1380,0,Base case @EllenSpertus base case. That should be if(you aren't here) {see the question https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1380/where-can-a-student-independently-learn-recursion-preferably-in-java},2017-07-04T08:55:56.297,1293
2554,1347,0,_@StephanBranczyk I was also too naive then to realize that my students weren't all like me. It takes a certain kind of person to get a doctorate maybe smart (enough) but certainly tenacious. In grad school you mostly see similar types. Then you go teach undergrads who aren't all like that. Most of our best professors in grad school were good lecturers so we who _could_ learn learned to value that over most other things. We had good models and the system worked _for us_ so we emulated it.,2017-07-04T10:14:02.473,1293

2557,1402,0,If I can paraphrase part of your answer I think you suggest that reaching every student requires a multi-dimensional approach both the techniques used and the personal dimension. Is that fair?,2017-07-04T11:09:48.617,1293
2559,1352,0,So @CodesInChaos to reach every student we need to (at least) be careful about making assumptions. Better testing assumptions. I think that Owen Astrachan of Duke has written a piece (not here) that using bubble sort is an anti-pattern. Therefore it is useful to study _only_ in that context. On the main topic here teachers can seek to help students improve memory or they can help students to <something...> perhaps focus more on the most important things.,2017-07-04T11:21:36.033,1293
2560,1405,0,I personally would never suggest abandoning the best students. Nor do I seek darling awards etc. I seek effectiveness and ways to achieve it. In fact I was generally perceived as being more effective with the superstars and helped many of them to shine brightly. So my personal problem was to find ways to include the others in the game. I think I (mostly) agree that lack of application in a student is the most difficult to work with and likely requires outside intervention. But students can find themselves behind and some methods leave them there. Avoidable? I'm seeking the _how_,2017-07-04T11:49:17.727,1293

2565,1398,1,Let me suggest (a) that the purpose of the exercise was to produce learning not a program and (b) I hope that the instructor was wise enough to see the picture you describe and act appropriately. Perhaps you both missed point (a). When I PP with a novice I realize that I have a different job then when doing it with a pro.

2577,1352,0,_@pddring: I just don't get why Bubble-sort is even taught since it's usually one of the worst-performing O(n^2) algos on real hardware.  Insertion vs. Selection sort would make more sense to me.  Or is the point of teaching Bubble that it shows how a less-obvious localized building block can be used in an algo to produce a global property (i.e. sortedness)?  IDK it's been many years since I was taking CS classes so it's hard to remember what it was like *not* just knowing this stuff plus a lot of stuff about tuning for cache etc.,2017-07-04T16:34:28.050,1654
2578,1380,0,Java does not fully support recursion (same for a lot of other languages) as it does not have tail call optimisation. It will not struggle with algorithms where the call depth is O(log n). However infinite recursion is impossible. Check to see if it is possible in scalla. I have heard that the problem is in the JVM however scalla may get around this by using trampolinning (A technique to simulate tail call recursion).,2017-07-04T16:38:36.917,204
2579,1352,2,_@petercordes it's just a really simple one to demonstrate with bits of paper and the fact that it's so inefficient make it easier to highlight the advantages of other algorithms,2017-07-04T17:18:04.573,674
2582,1160,1,CS50 AP is what I wish A Level Computing was when I took it - it's a class I wish I had the chance to take and the attitude towards learning and growth is a really healthy mindset to encourage.,2017-07-04T18:43:16.627,916
2583,1365,0,In a pure functional model the boxes model isn't very useful I think. Trying to map everything to it mentally while programming is a waste of effort <opinion/>. A dictionary takes you pretty far. I note that the Oxford English Dictionary when under development originally was literally a set of cubby boxes for definitions submitted by contributors. memory is a mapping from names (tokens) to values. Just extend something like the OOP reference-to-object model universally. No one thinks of the OED as a set of cubbies anymore I suspect. names reference things. Compiler writers need more.,2017-07-04T18:46:53.793,1293
2584,1365,0,For the record @nocomprende I did in fact build such a thing once to teach with. It even used magic slates (plastic sheet over black waxy background) for volatile memory. I finally threw it out & don't likely even have a photo of it anymore. You took me back a bit with your note. I never taught 8th grade though so you can't blame me. =) nor personally anyway.,2017-07-04T18:50:33.037,1293
2586,1300,0,Note that maths has 2 uses: `x^2 = y` and also `let y = 3 then there are 2 solutions` / `but setting x = 2 we get y = 4`,2017-07-04T18:58:48.610,1629
2587,1365,0,_@nocomprende. Like in The Matrix??? And are you stealing my jokes now (just after Chicxulub) or are you older than dirt too like myself? A pretty famous CS guy gave me the shirt to assure me that I am anyway.,2017-07-04T18:59:31.347,1293
2589,1365,1,My archeological layer is a bit lower than yours but I guess the mods will be on us for a conversation here. Be well. Or come to the Classroom chat.,2017-07-04T19:03:59.603,1293
2591,1404,0,_@Buffy No it should be your goal (until you find a better one) but it shouldn't necessarily be your colleagues' goal. They may think slightly differently than you do.,2017-07-04T19:16:13.350,1195
2592,1404,0,_@StephanBranczyk Let me rephrase the question here then. What would it take to convince you that it should be _your_ goal. I'll accept any (kind) answer.,2017-07-04T19:18:32.340,1293
2594,1404,0,Usually I become a better champion for an idea if I believe I'm the one who came up with it myself. That's why I think it's important to find out what are the current goals and current values of your colleagues first and foremost. Once you know what those are then you can help shape those goals of theirs to become more like yours. But ultimately their goals may never be truly identical to yours even if you help shape them.,2017-07-04T19:28:06.503,1195
2596,1407,0,I'm not so much in agreement with your first paragraph but have successfully used a variation on your technique for years. It provides encouragement for the willing and a path past a brief brain-freeze. Total Approval overall.,2017-07-04T19:55:02.483,1293
2597,1226,0,By that I mean actual programming examples rather than merely mansplaining the difference between words which your students already know.,2017-07-04T23:45:12.833,1567
2602,1246,0,This answer explains (mansplains) *what* the difference is between words that students already know. It does not intuit *why* a particular OOP access level would be used over another. For that actual programming examples would be required. Would that programming could be taught without programming and instead by ESL. A popular but wishful fantasy.,2017-07-05T00:11:42.757,1567
2603,1249,1,Excellent - there is nothing like a few code snippets to explain a coding concept. Thanks for not giving an ESL lesson on the difference between the words *public private etc.*,2017-07-05T00:12:42.963,1567
2605,1121,0,There are pedagogical patterns on this here:http://hillside.net/eduplop/patterns-publications/,2017-07-05T09:55:11.307,1293
2606,1410,3,Find something that requires that criticism to be taken on-board to show them the positives that come from improving their code - e.g. if your students are having problems with correct indentation: _This week class we are going to introduce ourselves to python._,2017-07-05T11:05:06.887,993
2607,1414,17,I agree but you can go further. Instead of Your program has unclear variable names here try _The program_ has unclear variable names here. Make it all about the program. Reward Revision is brilliant and should be a pedagogical pattern. But I'd dispute your restriction to secondary level. You can do it with doctoral students (imo) in their preparatory work. And reward can be more general than points.,2017-07-05T11:05:32.347,1293
2608,1414,1,The Embrace Correction Pedagogical Pattern is very similar to Reward Revision: Give the student the chance to improve their artifacts.,2017-07-05T11:10:36.830,1293
2609,1408,3,BTW it's not unusual; starting out is rough for virtually everybody. I think you'll find that you've arrived at a good place to get help though. (Plus we're glad to have you.) Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-05T11:18:19.583,27
2610,1418,1,I'm definitely the goofy informal sort of professor although I have a background that gives me credibility.,2017-07-05T12:38:07.623,283
2611,1418,0,yes of course. Goofy and Credible aren't inconsistent. But you need to build your myth carefully and slowly if you are new to the game. I took Mike Clancy as a role-model,2017-07-05T12:39:33.303,1293
2612,1397,0,If you could collect that information that would make a great publication/resource.,2017-07-05T12:40:11.547,283
2613,1414,0,I was also thinking that our program and what we might want to do might work,2017-07-05T13:23:31.860,967
2614,1410,0,I think that Baldrickk has right if students aren't really into it aniway they won't really listen feedbacks but if the feedback become a class they don't have the choice. And it avoid any form of criticism,2017-07-05T13:44:23.547,1375
2615,1414,10,_@Buffy I'm amused that in the comment here instead of saying I agree but this answer can go further it says I agree but __you__ can go further. It shows how difficult it actually is to provide this sort of criticism!,2017-07-05T14:10:28.077,177
2617,1309,0,Are you really using mutating equals when speaking about assignment (or binding in less state loving languages)?? Please don't. I don't have much teaching experience but I can draw conclusions from the mass of homework questions that get posted on SO: a good amount of them are only due to students not knowing (and thus not searching) for the correct terms.,2017-07-05T14:40:30.990,1430
2618,1309,0,That's a good point. :) You may be glad to hear that no I don't use that term regularly. I might use it (or something similar) one time to draw the distinction we are discussing here but I do go on to then explain the proper term. :),2017-07-05T14:43:30.763,27
2621,1410,5,I always try to explain to my interns what they are doing wrong with a calm patient and encouraging tone. Like _You see? Here you are reversing the array twice... :)_ or _It's not a huge deal but here you are not validating this input so you risk throwing an undocumented exception..._ but they always took it personal. Stumped for weeks I tried many tones and formulations. In the end what did the trick for me was to stop finishing each sentence with _...like an idiot._,2017-07-05T14:49:22.917,994
2626,1422,0,It seems as though this doesn't actually address the question asked: *Can anyone recommend a free online source where she can pick up and ideally practice recursion?*. Could you add some resource from which a student can learn recursion as the question states?,2017-07-05T15:31:12.323,150
2627,1410,1,Can you give an example of an interaction that results in a defensive or discouraged response from a student? I would love to add something helpful but I am having trouble working in the abstract.,2017-07-05T15:37:01.247,27
2628,1423,8,We're always glad to have thoughtful responses from the student perspective. Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-07-05T16:05:28.553,27
2630,1414,0,_@enderland I'm amused by _your_ comment here. I think < opinion > that when you give positive advice and encouragement _you_ can use _you_ just fine. But I take your meaning and thanks.,2017-07-05T16:19:05.677,1293
2634,1408,0,I am a newly qualified teacher today I tought 3 classes yr7 (11-12years old) and yr8(23-13 years old). We did a code combat hour of code. There are a few bugs the the first 5 minutes getting started was a pain. One of the buttons on the web page needs clicking 5 to 10 times. But with clear instruction and help they did it. After that it was a good lesson. Almost all made good progress. One in each class was refusing to enguage (zero resilience and one hiccup and they gave up). Everyone else did it (some with help).,2017-07-05T16:51:18.287,204
2653,1414,6,I might go one step further than **Avoid you statements**.  I think would I could recommend is to **use I statements**.  Say things like I am confused by this variable name.  This shows that the feedback is somewhat subjective.,2017-07-05T18:40:08.247,1710
2654,1427,0,Do you have a projector at the moment or just a whiteboard? If the choice is whiteboard vs SMART board it's different to projector vs SMART board of course.,2017-07-05T18:49:19.493,2
2656,1427,0,A similar question about when a blackboard should be used instead of a projector is [here](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/728/58).,2017-07-05T20:46:40.643,58
2657,1406,1,Pupils do not improve when given summative feedback (it even cancels out the effect of any formative feedback) but they do when given formative feedback ?€? I think I read this is evidence based teaching G. Petty. Therefore give formative feedback: tell them what went well and even better if **but do not give them a grade**. Give them nothing that allows them to compare with each other. But give them info so they know which areas to study. I have an idea for a pie chart where biggest area is proportional to study effort (not tried it yet).,2017-07-05T20:54:21.560,204
2659,1410,2,I think the general advice for code reviews in the industry is applicable here. Criticize the code not the coder. A function call would be cleaner here instead of You should have used a function... I'm guessing most of these people are on the way to becoming junior software engineers so using industry advice here would be really useful.,2017-07-05T22:05:49.660,1715
2661,1414,0,Another reason to avoid *you* is in real world they wll be modifying existing code. ?€?hey it wasn?€?t **my** variable name! It was like that already and I followed consistently.?€?,2017-07-06T00:34:05.243,1116
2662,1418,0,What is ?€?one true method?€??,2017-07-06T00:36:23.220,1116
2663,1418,0,Reading code with poor structure doesn't seem to teach real-world coders to do better or to even see the problem in my experience.  Why would it help for students?  It just teaches them that it?€?s normal for code to need decyphering to figure out before working on it.,2017-07-06T00:39:31.090,1116
2664,1435,1,I feel like you're drawing a distinction without a difference here unless you define what you mean by these terms. Nevertheless we are always glad to have a new voice join us here. Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-06T01:34:58.110,27
2665,1435,1,I simply feel that the best way to learn is by 'learning' rather than being taught to. Exposing flaws and alternatives stimulates critical thinking and would hardly be considered offensive by anyone,2017-07-06T01:50:44.773,63
2667,1434,0,Applets depend on the NSAPI interface  which is considered a security risk and is no longer supported by major browsers.  (Since IE11 is going to be the last of its lineage  supplanted by Edge  we can consider it dead for practical purposes.) The Java Webstart mechanism is less convenient to the user but much more secure.,2017-07-06T03:58:05.367,1537
2669,1410,0,Don't waste time judging indentation. Unless you're teaching python  the editor will do the formatting for you. At one place I worked we had a tool called SONAR which did automated code reviews  it was derisively referred to as some other nerds aesthetic requirements . However  using tools like find bugs (java) to guide you towards common bugs is a useful exercise.,2017-07-06T04:13:48.183,1537
2670,1414,0,Unless you're coding python  don't bother judging indentation. Modern editors take care of that for you.   Ctrl+a ctrl+shift+f will strictly style code to language preferred spec in most languages in my preferred (free) editor.,2017-07-06T04:17:50.547,1537
2671,1414,0,_@pojo-guy But it should be the *author* pressing the keys to do the formatting (before submitting!) not the *reviewer.* If the code is badly indented by review time it certainly merits pointing out.,2017-07-06T06:26:46.303,992
2672,1434,3,Excellent details and great information. Very informative and helpful.,2017-07-06T06:38:15.233,104
2673,1433,0,Now that's one benefit I had forgotten about the SMART board and perhaps it's only benefit over a whiteboard & projector combination. The annotations _can_ be saved as an image or series of images on the computer that controls the board. The resultant image(s) can be edited in Paint etc. later.,2017-07-06T06:43:25.840,104
2674,1434,0,What you wrote in the API section (as well as JShell and module system but that's a different comment) is very correct. I had not thought of using the  Process API for tooling but now I can see all sorts of interesting things the school can do. And as for Stream well it's planned all along and now I have a clearer image of how it can be done properly.,2017-07-06T06:45:34.223,150
2676,1436,2,You mean start every review by ?€??€? we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could ?€??€?? If I was at the receiving end of this I'd feel like you were saying ?€?you did a bad job but it's ok it's just because you're an idiot?€?. It doesn't get the team past blame quite the contrary.,2017-07-06T08:32:31.883,124
2677,1431,0,If you use these practices in industry you're making bad software. My experience is in security where we take quality seriously ?€???your industry may be more ok with bugs. There are many many cases where useful review feedback is ?€?I can't see a bug but the way you're writing it is dodgy you should write clearer code?€? (with specifics as to how it's dodgy and how to make it clear of course). This comes from experience not from pointing out a specific defect. It should be up to the coder to prove their code correct not up to the reviewer to prove it wrong.,2017-07-06T08:35:10.310,124
2678,1437,2,This is an interesting view. Welcome to [cseducators.se] I hope we'll be hearing more from you.,2017-07-06T08:39:42.977,150
2679,1420,1,I eventually went with creating a little text adventure to start with with each kid creating their own. Thanks for the idea!,2017-07-06T09:04:57.927,1688
2680,1427,0,I currently have a whiteboard and a projector which projects onto another whiteboard.,2017-07-06T09:10:51.170,938
2681,1418,0,_@JD??ugosz Sorry I was a bit cryptic. I was referring to a complex task that implements it in one class with one method. Actually I've had some success with discussing such poor structure code but also showing a better way.,2017-07-06T09:22:14.793,1293
2682,1430,1,If your CS curriculum depends on the specific version of a specific programming language it is broken. Or not a CS curriculum at all. IMHO.,2017-07-06T09:34:27.660,842
2683,1380,0,Expose her to functional programming. Not only will she be *forced* to use recursion she'll also widen her horizon considerably.,2017-07-06T09:37:15.527,842
2684,1430,0,_@Raphael it most certainly doesn't depend on a specific version but I'm wondering what are the benefits of upgrading to java 9 specifically because of the changes in comparison to previous versions.,2017-07-06T10:28:43.120,150
2685,1430,1,For me leading by example would be enough. You don't use outdated stuff. (I remember a prof explaining concurrency with Java 1.4 -- in 2008.) Maybe not hot-off-the-press stuff either (why?) so there's a trade-off here. (What *would* be interesting is to compare the versions together with the students. Why were certain changes made which problems are being solved? That's bound to lead to insight.),2017-07-06T11:06:38.870,842
2689,1389,0,_@nocomprende well the exit statement is a simple check: `student.getLearntSubjects().contains(Recursion);`,2017-07-06T11:36:24.790,150
2690,1414,0,Since code reviews are typically done in the editor on a projector  it's not unusual to do that at the code review if it is needed (or at all). Spacing is just something that doesn't get talked about in a real code reviews in languages where spacing has no semantic meaning. Python and COBOL are different because spaces change the logic of the program.,2017-07-06T11:45:27.883,1537
2691,1410,0,I think you can use your own code as example. You can get an old code and new code and compare the improvement with the class.  This shows that you code will be better with knowledge and how it's importante to be critical with your own code.,2017-07-06T12:09:36.930,1727
2692,1311,0,While many languages don't use = for assignment almost every popular language does if you look at any table of most popular languages.,2017-07-06T12:47:47.063,1611
2693,1420,1,_@kosciCZ you're bringing me back to my days of Zork! :-),2017-07-06T13:11:59.450,1529
2695,1380,0,_@Raphael Thanks but I teach functional programming in depth later in the curriculum. My question is not how to provide a deep understanding of recursion but how to quickly get her up to speed so she can understand a recursive factorial or fibonacci for a sophomore-level course.,2017-07-06T14:09:59.940,283
2697,1417,0,This is an excellent answer to a question that I did not ask. Why don't you ask that question and use this answer? (It's okay to answer your own question.),2017-07-06T14:11:21.683,283
2698,1391,0,This is an excellent answer to a question that I did not ask. Why don't you ask that question and use this answer? (It's okay to answer your own question.),2017-07-06T14:11:41.383,283
2699,1380,0,_@EllenSpertus I don't see how these are different things but then I don't have experience teaching on that level.,2017-07-06T14:12:04.660,842
2700,1380,0,_@Raphael In the advanced course they'd learn about tail recursion the Y-combinator etc. For computer architecture I just need them to understand the simplest examples. Knowing tail call optimization (raised by @richard) would be premature since my purpose of using recursion in computer architecture is for them to see the stack behavior of ordinary recursion in an imperative language.,2017-07-06T14:20:18.710,283
2701,1446,0,Thanks. I will look into that. I've seen hardware devices that use this technique. The fact that you can bring your own mobile device (or classroom computer) makes it more usable. This would be helpful for my earlier lectures that discuss concepts and terms.,2017-07-06T14:26:33.983,1529
2702,1445,2,Or better: give up on powerpoint altogether. Or pass out the slides on paper before the lecture so your students don't have to copy them and can write directly on them. Otherwise good advice. Make the students active participants not passive consumers,2017-07-06T14:53:20.013,1293
2703,1380,0,_@EllenSpertus You can learn about functional programming without mentioning these more involved concepts. My point is that by taking away state and loops you *force* students to think recursively. They can stay with the basic features of say Haskell for this lesson. [Try Haskell](https://www.tryhaskell.org/) is a nice enough intro for instance.,2017-07-06T15:04:12.190,842
2704,1444,4,One word: interaction,2017-07-06T15:23:54.817,283
2705,1444,1,I totally agree. It's great when there's more interaction. Learning all their names helps. But I find some students are just not comfortable participating.,2017-07-06T15:37:51.883,1529
2706,1446,0,My personal experience has been less than positive with this. Some of us don't have phones capable of participating (and some even turn their phones off in lectures!); it never runs smoothly enough (perhaps PINGO is less terrible); and has rarely been used to test anything worthwhile (i.e. represents an annoying stall for students who can keep pace). Use of such systems suggests to me a lecturer who substitutes real interaction and running enthusiasm for intermittent opportunities to become distracted. Just my experience but I think it is easy to run badly (I'm sure Sirko does a good job!),2017-07-06T16:11:41.337,1333
2707,1449,4,I would very much like to see your 2d array stuff flying in and out to get a sense of what you think a student's misconceptions are.  One of my courses is C for Java programmers so there are some habits to break but I'm curious what you've seen students get wrong from the start.,2017-07-06T17:16:09.947,1564
2708,1449,0,They start off by thinking of it as a 2D grid instead of a single stack reference pointing to a single array of references to other arrays.,2017-07-06T17:18:10.247,27
2709,1449,0,Ok I now understand why that model doesn't work in Java.  Sometimes my reptilian brain goes back to C without me wanting it to.,2017-07-06T17:19:44.450,1564
2710,1449,0,I mean the chessboard-style mental model *works* in a 2d array until you start doing things like `my2DArray[3] = new int[10]` and then it starts breaking down really fast. At some point you need to know how it really works.,2017-07-06T17:22:40.400,27
2711,1449,1,This is an area that I can definitely improve. Your response reminds me of how Steve Jobs meticulously prepared for his presentations. Every word was perfectly place perfectly. He practiced his presentations over and over until he was satisfied. I need to put more effort into the content and delivery of my presentations.,2017-07-06T17:36:15.203,1529
2712,1450,1,I am guilty of teaching in a way that I would understand. Sometimes I forget that these students of < 1 year of programming and I have > 20. I like your suggestion to have a short lesson + an individual or team activity. That'll take some effort but I have time.,2017-07-06T17:40:25.450,1529
2713,1431,0,So your diverging experience makes mine bad software? While I appreciate your input on the matter you're making generalizations from an admitted point of specialty. If you have to ask if other parts of the industry care about bugs less than security I don't know what to tell you other than yes the industry in-general is going to care less about bugs than the security layers _naturally_ with few but notable exceptions. Lastly it's the coder's _unit tests_ that proves their code works. CR is _not_ the place to prove your code works but proves it passes muster.,2017-07-06T17:56:08.990,1193

2719,1380,0,_@Raphael I have edited the question to make it clearer that I am asking about work a beginning student can do on their own in order to learn the minimum necessary amount of recursion for a sophomore-level course. I encourage you to ask and answer a more general question about learning recursion [in greater depth] as you have some good suggestions.,2017-07-06T20:36:40.473,283
2720,1449,1,_@BenI. It's funny to see the miscommunication between you and Chris given the class he mentioned. What you describe is how arrays work in *Java* but that is not how they work *in general* though there are some other languages which approach it similarly to Java. You need to be careful when teaching or your students will think that is *The* way. You will find in other languages that a 2D array is really just a 1D array big enough to hold N by M elements all in 1 continuous block. In fact that is what I thought you were going to bring up in response to common misconceptions.,2017-07-06T21:03:17.433,1740
2721,1449,0,_@Aaron That is news to me. In C (at least with my compiler) it works as it does in Java.  How in the world would you implement a ragged array without an array of references?,2017-07-06T21:12:13.647,27
2722,1449,0,*I... spoke too soon.*  I was wrong. My version of C does not do as I thought... that seems positively awful to me. This tradeoff is just to avoid following an extra pointer???,2017-07-06T21:18:14.700,27
2723,1410,1,I like to tell people who are not listening when I do code reviews: Michael Jordan had a coach.,2017-07-06T21:21:06.140,1742
2725,1455,0,Those are great resources. It's always a pleasure to welcome a teacher to our little community.  Welcome to [cseducators.se]!  I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-07-06T22:03:55.770,27
2726,1449,0,Honestly learning about the Java implementation is fine. I'm stuck with Java on account of APCS A and this provides a great chance to mix working with both stored references and calculated addresses which are translatable fundamental skills in any environment.  In this instance I can mention and explain the C way (and its trade-offs) in about 20 seconds if they understand the Java approach well.,2017-07-06T22:09:25.300,27
2728,1431,0,_@kayleeFrye_onDeck Unit tests prove that the code works *in some cases* which is a far cry from the code working. I'm aware that some parts of the industry don't care about quality. I don't want to train the next generation of programmers in that spirit.,2017-07-06T22:32:24.940,124
2729,1431,0,While apathy can lead to bugs the existence of bugs is not proof of apathy. I said they care _less_ not that they don't care and yes code reviews are _not_ where you prove your code works. Unit tests integration tests functional tests/sample apps you name it; that's where you verify code _works_. If you're deep-diving the code for bug and security analysis you're describing a _code audit_ not a code review. They're quite different in their scope of responsibility and depth of analysis.,2017-07-06T23:09:29.813,1193
2730,1431,0,Btw I'm not trying to brow-beat you on the objective importance of quality in code. It's _very_ important but it's not everything _all the time_. You work in security so of course you'd be biased about it and you can't help that easily. I wouldn't expect it otherwise. Medical equipment security layers aviation systems weapons systems automated vehicle solutions -- those things are life & death code and that stuff gets its own umbrella of quality requirements well outside the normal bounds of responsibility of code quality. I would never discourage quality code.,2017-07-06T23:19:52.297,1193
2731,1431,0,And lastly I usually take off kid-gloves for code-audits. There's no point in not pointing out flaws and vulnerabilities when someone requests in-depth analysis of your code. How I interact with someone during an audit is not the same as a review so if I were to take your feedback and put in the scope of an audit I believe we would be in agreement on the level of coverage and type of feedback returned.,2017-07-06T23:22:41.240,1193
2732,1459,1,I just recently heard the second style described as Egyptian brackets which totally cracked me up (also the style I use),2017-07-06T23:29:14.950,237
2734,1459,6,Yes both are fine but we all know the second method is better...=P,2017-07-07T00:12:48.933,919
2735,1366,0,I desperately love this information (and just purchased a book about active learning because of this post) but if it is an answer to OPs question I'm having trouble seeing how. Are you suggesting that active learning is specifically more important than course content?  I wonder if there is somewhere else this information fits into the site because it is so darned important,2017-07-07T01:22:32.437,27
2736,1462,0,Buffy and I must be from the same timeline! +1 for let the IDE do it.,2017-07-07T02:48:47.003,1537
2737,1430,0,As much as i am in favor of using the latest and greatest another reality is that much of computer programming is maintenance of old code. I recently upgraded a system that was still running java 2 and have maintained and written new COBOL code in the past 5 years. Figuring out how to work without lambda's might be good for an advanced exercise.,2017-07-07T02:53:15.930,1537
2739,1366,1,_@BenI The usual defense of traditional teaching is that the teacher can get through more content or include more ancillary information. My answer is intended to say that these reasons are misguided and that if covering content trades off against student involvement go with student involvement.,2017-07-07T03:01:18.813,765

2742,1454,0,I thought so at first but then I took a closer look at the Modular System,2017-07-07T06:42:24.760,150
2743,1425,1,your examples at the link here https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/130/how-to-teach-why-indentation-is-important/132#132 are informative!,2017-07-07T08:05:33.087,1759
2744,1449,0,_@BenI. Pointer dereferencing is actually pretty expensive. Traditionally in C (less so nowadays I think) arrays needed to be a constant size known at compile-time anyway since the compiler wasn't clever enough to dynamically allocate more or less stack. Remember the heap is off-limits in terms of C **language** features; only in the standard library can you use it (and many embedded systems have a more minimal subset of C with no heap). So you would have to put an array of pointers on the stack (thereby taking up more memory) and all the actual arrays (fixed-length) on the stack too.,2017-07-07T08:48:56.077,988
2745,1449,0,_@BenI. So if you want ragged arrays you can create an array of pointers and allocate them manually with malloc/free. But if you want known-size 2D arrays C's way is perfectly adequate and much more efficient efficient.,2017-07-07T08:49:50.637,988
2746,1458,6,+1 for the comments on consistency. That was my first thought. Let them choose their own style because it's a fun personal preference to get irrationally angry about (so you'd get plenty of push-back from people who already learnt how to code and decided on their favourite brace style if you did try to enforce one). But penalise them if they aren't consistent within their own code or with other code written as part of a group project.,2017-07-07T09:09:14.623,988
2747,1444,1,Great talk on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmN_tBS0t4,2017-07-07T09:12:21.693,1762
2748,1366,0,Okay I see where you're going with that though it's not really made explicit.  Rather than fixing it here. though do you think that this answer might be a better fit [here](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1444/how-do-you-make-your-cs-lectures-more-interesting)?,2017-07-07T09:17:26.250,27
2749,1449,0,_@Muzer I understood everything except the bit about off-limits. I would love it if you [came by in chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) to help me break that down. Also I guess I rarely work on problems large/long enough to be getting cache misses but I do see why the C approach is cheaper for a standard uniform 2D array. Sometimes you really are [better off](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67) with a ragged array of course.,2017-07-07T09:55:04.447,27
2750,1467,3,This is an important answer.  See [here](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/1366/27) for some research to back you up :)  Welcome to [cseducators.se]. We appreciate a thoughtful student perspective.  I hope we hear more from you!,2017-07-07T09:57:31.420,27
2754,1469,2,Hi Edwin! Could you please expand on this further? There really isn't much in this answer.,2017-07-07T12:52:02.553,58
2755,1449,0,_@FedericoPoloni I surely did :) Thanks for the correction!,2017-07-07T12:59:35.297,27
2759,1458,1,On the other hand is it not important to teach students that out in the real world you can't always use your preferred style? Getting them used to using tools for formatting (whether it be IDE-based or a script they use etc.) provides a benefit; I've found that once students get in the habit of using whatever style they want even when they're in college it's hard to get them to stick to a style guide even when tools are available to easily modify the style.,2017-07-07T13:59:11.337,654
2760,1450,1,_@EdwinTorres Your point is well-made and too-frequently misunderstood. If you already understand a concept you can probably find a way to explain it very clearly and cogently.  If I don't already understand it that clear cogent explanation is all too often meaningless. Being able to explain it based on what context the STUDENT has ... that is priceless.  Best recovery I've seen from this was to present the answer then break it down exploring parts of the breakdown based on feedback from the student(s).  Give them a goal (the initial explanation) then guide them to the goal.,2017-07-07T14:08:39.127,948
2761,1410,0,Don't expect this to be easy; lots of professionals have trouble with this. A few have trouble *giving* code criticism constructively.,2017-07-07T14:13:48.643,1139
2764,1470,0,Thank you! With regards to the other laws I cover those in my next mini-unit (CNF and DNF) so they're basically the next thing. Should I mention that in my question?,2017-07-07T14:52:19.783,27
2767,1470,0,_@BenI. I don't think you need to mention it in your question I was just being thorough. I think it's not too relevant with respect to the question asked :),2017-07-07T14:57:45.250,747
2768,1473,0,The final report should reflect all the work that the student has done during the internship. Someone that didn??t follow his/her work should be able to understand it simply by reading the report. What you are suggesting is also what I think is right. Some of my colleagues think that there should be some kind of a centralized list of requirements... :(,2017-07-07T14:59:09.267,1144
2769,1474,0,I agree. The thing is the final report should reflect all the work that the student has done during the internship. Someone that didn??t follow his/her work should also be able to understand it simply by reading the report.,2017-07-07T15:02:48.627,1144
2770,1473,0,Ah I see. Even in the industry today it is hard to convince some old timers of the new age of Agile :P If your colleagues don't want to add a new list for students in an Agile environment then perhaps just add these new requirements and word it as answer all that apply? Judging Agile with Waterfall is like judging a tutle for his ability to climb a tree.,2017-07-07T15:03:24.247,747
2771,1474,0,_@NunoGilFonseca I think with the user stories planning and retrospectives you should cover practically everything of interest. Is it a strict requirement that **absolutely everything** is covered or could you just encourage your students to update their retrospective document at the end of every sprint reflecting on their work personally along with the usual Agile processes?,2017-07-07T15:07:32.737,2
2772,1475,0,I am aware of that! And they do all of that during the development. My question was more focused on what and how should that info be integrated into one thesis-like report.,2017-07-07T15:13:34.193,1144
2774,1474,0,Our main problem is that right now there is not a formal clarification of what must be covered... :(,2017-07-07T15:21:09.120,1144
2776,1475,0,It depends on the target audience. System architecture diagrams work well as figures in an overview section for all audiences. Developers might want to see UML class diagrams or excerpts from generated documentation in a software design section. I would also include a requirements section to convey the capabilities of the software. A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) works well.,2017-07-07T15:22:22.803,1529

2789,1449,0,_@BenI. wrote How in the world would you implement a ragged array Two points here: 1) You can still have an array of pointers which point to arrays which is practically the same thing 2) In all my years I have seen non-square arrays needed so seldom that I don't think it would be an issue even if it were not possible; on the rare occasion you needed one you could use a square large enough to fit your longest raggedy sub-array and ignore the extra unused locations - intuitively I think that would improve speed in most cases but could hit memory use depending on how non-uniform the raggedness,2017-07-07T16:33:23.823,1740
2790,1484,0,You can easily modify that example: String[] iceCreamChoices = new String[]{chocolate vanilla strawberry tutti frutti};,2017-07-07T16:45:36.457,1529
2791,1483,0,_@richard For Year 7 students you tell them no solutions. They probably won't be familiar with complex numbers at that stage unless they're way ahead of their class (they're usually taught in Year 12/13 Further Maths not to a Year 7 class),2017-07-07T16:59:02.213,2

2805,1457,5,Having been a software architect for years enforcing coding standards has been part of my responsibilities. Nevertheless I fully agree with your assessment that this topic does not deserve significant classroom time and I would wish more educators would take your stance. A consistent coding style is particularly valuable in long-running projects with big teams but a typical student assignment is neither. Also I find your emphasis on readability over formatting details spot on because formatting can be established by automated tools while naming and design still require human judgment.,2017-07-07T18:55:10.230,1775
2806,1458,2,I disagree strongly. Attention to detail is best reinforced where it actually matters and through natural consequences. For instance having to track down one's off-by-one errors communicates the need for caring about details far more effectively than being asked to adhere to arbitrary rules because the teacher said so ever could. Also while I fully agree that craftsmanship is important code formatting is a very small part of that -  and one of the least important ones because it can be (and often is) fully automated.,2017-07-07T19:08:04.923,1775
2807,1458,3,That is if you want to be close to the industry give your students development environments that automate code formatting. For many languages even open source development environments can do this :-),2017-07-07T19:11:25.933,1775
2809,1496,0,:) I never told that to any of them (and i know its not my job to do it). The thing is that it really makes me sad.

2836,1331,0,why use an analogy? I would maybe use an analogy to explain it to someone not interested in computers to give them a quick idea of what it's for but if you're actually teaching someone about IP addresses and ports I don't see how an analogy helps just tell them how it works. An analogy might actually be counter-productive in fact.,2017-07-08T03:08:33.607,1756

I will have to look further to see if there is indeed anyone that could talk with this students... All my colleagues acknowledge the problem but the truth is that no one does a thing to change it... and the situation just keeps on repeating.,2017-07-08T09:25:13.643,1144

2851,1506,1,Ellen this is a good idea! Unfortunately this will not work in my country (Portugal). Here once the student enrolls in a program the school cannot tell him/her that he cannot proceed... :( Our data indeed show that students that were unable to pass (or had very low grades) in the first year programming classes will have serious problems in all the remaining classes that involve programming. The only thing we have are soft pre-requisites (you should know this to do that).,2017-07-08T09:36:11.847,1144
2852,1295,0,To explain: Bus Factor is the minimum number of team members that if they left the project (went over the cliff in a bus crash) the project becomes unviable. Pair Programming and similar practices are partly intended to increase this number as knowledge is spread through the team. Sometimes called Bus Number. Thanks @Thorbj??rnRavnAndersen an important point. Only the extremely rare prima donna is allowed to work alone and then only when there are no alternatives. If Thug The Troll has a unique skill then you may need to let him work alone. But you must _really_ need that skill.,2017-07-08T12:14:25.833,1293
2853,1510,0,All the students are aware of what we consider as plagiarism however they just keep on doing it... :( As you said if the tool warns the students about plagiarism they may try to change the code till the tools says the code is fine. The gotcha thing alone was also something that we wanted to avoid as it may be totally ineffective. So my question is: I have early knowledge about plagiarism from a student shall I do something or just wait to punish that student?,2017-07-08T13:19:23.233,1144
2854,1510,0,I was once thought to be slacking by my most respected professor. Not plagiarizing but also a problem. He and I met by chance in an elevator for a few moments and in a few sentences he made me re-think my priorities. A friendly word can be stronger than a shout. It is also possible that he arranged the elevator talk without my noticing.,2017-07-08T13:33:16.553,1293

3862,2511,0,Also it's my first question here and I didn't know what tags were popular. Feel free to retag. I think I just created a new one called advising but I also think there would be value to such a tag.

3863,1509,1,_@nocomprende I wish you wouldn't ignore it even once. I worry that when students get away with something it only cements the habit. First impressions matter and the first impression of cheating should not be a good one!,2017-07-08T15:38:19.257,294
3864,1414,1,_@sixtyfootersdude - I want to add a caveat to your comment. For me as a tall white male if I say I am confused by... then students will take that to mean they should probably revise their code (as you suggested). But if one of my female colleagues said that students might take it as her actually being confused and it might feed into their biases against her. In the end it could cause more student resistance against her. I like Buffy's wording best.,2017-07-08T15:41:57.717,294
3866,2511,1,It might also be relevant to look around [Academia](https://academia.stackexchange.com/) Stack Exchange for non-subject specific answers; in particular [How long should letters of recommendation for students be?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/5061/how-long-should-letters-of-recommendation-for-students-be) I would imagine this question is on-topic here too though.,2017-07-08T15:48:29.713,2
3868,1500,0,Advice from a teacher may be more valued than advice from a career guidance counselor because the student must interact with the teacher and therefore knows the teacher better than some counselor that the student's never met.,2017-07-08T15:56:05.883,1676
3869,2512,0,I'd be extremely reluctant to tell them not to go in the field primarily because of what is described by the third paragraph of vacip's answer. Case in point: I once taught (in college) an ex-truck driver. He struggled to get Ds. This old guy was in no way suited to excel in this field. The career center was obligated to be involved for each student and summoned me to discuss this problematic instance.  I talked to him to make sure saw/expected realistically. He was striving to better understand the field that his son was to join. He had a sensible reason.  Satisfied I let him decide,2017-07-08T16:08:53.293,1676
3870,1509,0,nocomprede it happens in several different classes of an higher education degree. I also have some students that work along with their collegues. One is working while the rest are looking at the screen. In the end all feel that they've participated and so can submit the same solution. rcpinto Exactly! The problem is even worse when the students that give the code know even less that the ones that asked for it. DavidWhite I agree! In the past some collegues were a bit permissive so when I say that no one is allowed to do plagiarism they kind of ignore it.,2017-07-08T16:14:16.113,1144

3872,1496,0,+0: I flip-floped about equally whether to up-vote or downvote. +1 for 3rd paragraph! I've read numerous accounts of people traumatized by this who succeeded anyway but were driven by intense anger. Causing this is not the approach I'd recommend. -1: 4th paragraph. You understand that such drinking is likely illegal for most college students in many areas.  And you suggest they be alcohol-influenced when trying to make serious life decisions? I like 2nd paragraph but not your 5th's 3rd sentence (being friends is succeeding as a human so intervention is desirable; don't shy from such burdens),2017-07-08T16:25:22.757,1676
3874,2511,2,I'll second looking at Academia rather than here. They are focused on that sort of thing. Unless you think that there is a special CS aspect. I can't think of one myself.,2017-07-08T16:35:14.133,1293
3875,2512,0,If he's been at it for 10 years he's certainly not achieving typical market expectations of performance.  So if he isn't needing to achieve such typical accomplishment then does he even need a degree? Maybe he has no need to graduate soon. So if he hasn't dropped out then what motivation is he pursuing? Presumably he has one as he keeps signing up for an expensive activity that costs both money (from somewhere) and time. Do keep doing your job (trying to get them unstuck) but don't feel like you're immoral because they make the choice to keep staying in the program.  It is their choice,2017-07-08T16:50:55.150,1676

3880,1509,0,Looks like a solution in search of a problem. In an on-premise test you'd rather use supervision to prevent plagiarism rather than detect it from program similarity. In a take-home test you'd need to engage in highly unethical behaviour like mandating the use of spyware on the student's computer to obtain the code as it's written.,2017-07-08T17:42:38.300,839

3882,1509,0,_@CodesInChaos There are a lot of tools that collect snapshots from the student?€?s code as they write it. The students just need to install one plugin in their IDE (Eclipse for instance). In the case of the tool that we are developing (and as I said has a different main focus rather than plagiarism) the students are fully aware that the system is collecting data and are also aware of how it is being used. So far no student has complained or felt violated. In our case a new snapshot of the code is taken when the student runs the code.,2017-07-08T18:11:45.697,1144
3883,1509,0,As someone who was falsely accused of plagarism in CS please always consider the possibility that students handed in similar or identical assignments by sheer chance. This is particularly true if the problem being solved is simple the language being used tends to steer students into similar patterns (e.g. python) the variable names are obvious given the problem domain etc. Especially if the assignment is < 100 LoC.,2017-07-08T18:24:18.307,1790
3884,1509,0,_@JaredSmith of course! Right now the system is only triggered if there is a high probability of plagiarism. Anyway the system only notifies the teacher of the possibility of plagiarism and presents to the teacher both source codes side and using a Diff tool highlights the similarities. It is totally up to the teacher to decide if it is indeed plagiarism or not. Anyway my question was to related to understand if the teacher should do something or not.,2017-07-08T18:39:57.793,1144

3891,2519,0,Hmm I'm not sure if I agree with this. When I was finishing my PhD one of the professors I'd asked for a letter asked me to write something to help him and I really had no idea where to start (knowing nothing about letters). I'm not convinced my students would either. Also it seems like a lot of work to ask all of my students to do this even if only 1 per class will ever ask me for a letter. Plus if I do it at the start of term how could they answer the questions you pose?,2017-07-08T19:31:13.520,294

3918,2526,0,I think different loads between departments is not feasible (both for real and political reasons) but a department _can_ give new faculty a lighter load so that they can get established both with research and teaching. We senior faculty can take up the slack but it takes a very cooperative environment to achieve. Some places have done this. I think Dartmouth is (or was at least) pretty good about this.,2017-07-09T12:43:14.873,1293
3919,2526,0,Denison has a lower load for faculty in CS. I think that Richmond and Davidson do too. At one point I made a list of liberal arts colleges that did. One way to sell it is to give credit for labs since it's very common for faculty in say biology to get teaching credit for their labs. Plus keeping a course up to date with modern advances will often happen in the lab part of the class!,2017-07-09T13:18:00.453,294
3920,2523,0,Thanks for the suggestion. Let me think about it a bit and see if I come up with a good question.,2017-07-09T13:18:59.297,294

3932,2529,1,Hey welcome to [cseducators.se]! This answer is a bit of a *stub answer* right now. *(Don't worry; SE is insanely complex and there is a real learning curve. You are not the first first-time poster to have this problem I promise)* What you should do is edit your answer and flesh it out with a little more detail. Some possibilities: what in particular is good and useful about the videos? What are their downsides (if any)? Where do they fit into a larger context of learning about the material?,2017-07-09T23:09:03.090,27
3933,2531,0,There is a lot for me to think about in this comment. Scheme is pretty much fixed in place (as functional programming is one of the core goals of the course) but I think many of the rest of the changes you propose are extremely sensible. And I know on SE we are usually avoid thank you but it really feels merited here. This gave me a lot to think about.,2017-07-10T00:44:20.963,27
3934,2529,0,To add to what @BenI. said Stack Exchange tends to frown upon link only answers (answers that would be useless without the link). Please try and give enough summary and details from the video that someone could gain from this answer without clicking the link.,2017-07-10T02:13:01.713,58
3935,1459,0,_@DavidLively Uh... not really. That would have to be one weird for loop - are you in the habit of declaring the indexing variable outside of the loop? Unless you're doing pointer arithmetic you're most likely going to get an undefined/undeclared variable error. The only case where you could reasonably expect commenting out the for line to compile would be the equivalent of `for (;;)` or `while (true)`. That can certainly lead to interesting errors but they're also the kinds of loops that need a lot of scrutiny regardless :),2017-07-10T09:12:05.390,1816
3936,1465,0,Well looking at your text... you chose your own punctuation in writing. The punctuation you're using is *not* proper English (and what style of English are you using anyway? There's many to choose from in the first place). Not a good way of reinforcing your opinion of standardised formatting is so important :) Now I think we can all agree that there's plenty of things that are important - your text would be a lot harder to read if it didn't use periods or spaces. I assume your indentation is intentionally silly. But commas periods ellipsis... there's so many valid styles out there :),2017-07-10T09:17:59.660,1816
3937,2533,0,I particularly like the idea of releasing the lab in timed releases and I could possibly make the first timed release before the unit even begins with some helper functions (even if they don't understand the entire scope of the problem yet).  I still try to experiment regularly because that's how I come to new forms but this one clearly didn't work :),2017-07-10T11:21:46.387,27
3944,1465,0,I understand the point of view you're coming from however I do disagree with it.     Perhaps the following two versions of the same S.M.A.R.T Reporting Script I use for FreeNAS would demonstrate my point a bit better.  [S.M.A.R.T Report w/ formatting](https://pastebin.com/raw/rAUyXsMq) & [S.M.A.R.T Report w/o formatting](https://pastebin.com/raw/S7gYthgq)... which do you find easier to read and edit?    Granted in an [editor](https://1drv.ms/i/s!Aqp3KD9IuSlugrBVrxKf5QI73TcJyQ) it's a bit better but not much,2017-07-10T14:24:07.597,1751
3946,1465,0,The first. But it's still *your* style of formatting. I'm all for readability but where's the standardisation you speak so highly of? Is this a common bash formatting standard you're following or just something that looks good and readable to you? The question is all about the conflicts among standards (indent with four spaces!) not the things people tend to agree on (indent!). You might be answering a different question. Would a script that uses four spaces (or a tab) to indent instead of your two be any worse (assuming all the other scripts in the context use the same style)?,2017-07-10T14:41:42.660,1816
3947,1459,0,I declare the loop variable in the loop's initializer.  On second thought most of the time I just comment out the whole thing esp if it's a while loop.,2017-07-10T15:50:11.543,21

3954,2541,1,Is [this](http://www.huffmancoding.com/code/fmg/) the game to which you are referring?,2017-07-10T17:21:30.883,27
3955,1485,0,I would do it all in liner maths just adding subtraction multiplying dividing and rounding. No need for selection. You complicate the problem when you start thinking that a year has an end. Time is continues.,2017-07-10T17:21:34.477,204
3956,2540,0,Sadly I cannot say any more about their background since I don't know yet who my students will be or even how many. :)  But I'll fill in more detail as it is revealed to me!,2017-07-10T17:22:45.773,1015
3957,2518,0,The website I checked said that Portugal has a red and yellow state. Red red and yellow green yellow back to red. Is this not the case. Note that my pupils said that this was not true [here in england] but I showed them a video then set them home work to stare at traffic lights. They said that they were surprised.,2017-07-10T17:25:01.260,204
3958,2541,0,Yes. Thanks. I hadn't seen that reference. Source (Java) can be found at the Greenroom.,2017-07-10T17:26:54.467,1293
3959,2540,0,What is the purpose of these meetings? When you say introduction to AI do you want to show AI at work or behind the scenes of AI? The former is for everyone while the latter requires University level linear algebra calculus and statistics.,2017-07-10T17:31:51.440,747
3960,913,0,Don't believe it it is not true. We use `sed`.,2017-07-10T17:41:58.633,204
3961,913,1,Snap has a facility to allow you to write a translator to convert snap code to any other language. And another to make snap look like another language.,2017-07-10T17:43:08.120,204
3962,342,0,You are correct that part of the problem is in the notation resembling normal maths. There is nothing wrong with this maths (except that things are much much harder to prove in imperative programs unless constrained to me functional) it is just different. 1+1 = 1 (Boolean algebra).,2017-07-10T17:49:21.890,204
3963,1465,0,No the OP asked specifically _Should I require students to follow a standard for assignments and team projects (perhaps conventions of their own choosing) or should I ignore these as trivialities?_  Perhaps you misread that?  If the script with formatting applied is easier for one to read then it would also by default be easier to grade than a script w/o formatting.,2017-07-10T18:08:10.423,1751
3964,2518,0,_@richard :) Never saw that red and yellow scenario... These are the commom traffic lights around here: http://codigo.pt/sinais-de-transito/sinais-luminosos/ (Sorry but it is in portuguese).,2017-07-10T18:08:12.920,1144

3969,2541,0,_@DaveI you need a bit more rep to vote.,2017-07-10T19:00:50.673,1293

3980,2551,28,Do you know that the author voluntarily shared the work and it wasn't taken from them unwittingly?,2017-07-10T20:05:57.297,283
3981,2551,2,I suppose that most of the times they share the work voluntarily although they don't admit.,2017-07-10T20:17:14.737,1144

3987,2560,0,Ben my school has a code of conduct but it does not say anything about this particular issue. Your idea about the debate is a very good one but I teach in a higher education school where several of my kids are older than I am :) and I suppose I won't have time for that! But I will for sure start doing a debate about this issue on the first class of the semester.,2017-07-10T20:59:02.553,1144
3988,2553,20,I think it worth mentioning that the pricing scheme for some git hosting sites makes it likely that some students will use public repositories for their projects even if working solo. I and several of my peers did this - and I am quite confident that this was done because of money not in order to facilitate academic dishonesty.,2017-07-10T21:13:41.920,650
3990,2563,3,She has quite an interesting story! Nice first post and welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-07-10T21:35:01.793,27
3992,2559,1,I love #1. Could you expand a bit (or give a link) for #s 2 and 3? I am having trouble following.,2017-07-10T21:40:21.793,27
3997,2563,4,+1 Wow... Hollywood film star who also developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes... I'm just gonna crawl back in my hole now. Though sadly (for the purposes of this question) it seems like she was more of a female electrical engineer rather than computer scientist? I wouldn't really call frequency hopping and spread-spectrum technology a CS thing especially not something you'd talk about in an undergrad class. How I wish there was a way to talk about her though.,2017-07-10T22:36:35.937,823
3999,2567,2,Hi Or! Welcome to [cseducators.se]. This is a very interesting answer and I hope to see you around the site more contributing your knowledge.,2017-07-10T23:09:59.163,58
4001,2540,1,I was only a year older when I developed an AI for connect 4 on my own. Never was able to beat it either. It was just a simple look ahead and rank possible branches AI algorithm. Not sure if it has a real name.,2017-07-10T23:11:59.683,1830

4012,2569,2,Hmmm. Doesn't that put more work on an innocent party?,2017-07-11T00:23:38.537,1293
4015,2568,0,Bob is the author of his solutions. How can you forbid him to publish his own work? Plagiarism is the fault of the plagiazer not the original author.,2017-07-11T00:31:14.603,1834
4016,2553,8,What do you mean by facilitating cheating? When I was a student I published a lot of assignment solutions. I was the author after all I can do whatever I want with what I've created.,2017-07-11T00:36:33.983,1834
4017,2568,0,_@D??uris Published? I'm talking about students copying code written for class projects; nothing's published anywhere (or *worth* publishing for that matter).  But if Bob had previously published code that he reused for the assignment then the publication's timestamp would establish Bob as the original author and I'd require Alice to cite that source just like anything else she found online.  And if Bob only wrote the code for the assignment he should hold off on publishing it until all the submissions are in.,2017-07-11T00:42:57.127,827
4018,2561,1,Yes looking at an Eliza-type program's source could be very informative.  Get one in the right language and have the students extend it and add new behavior/responses/triggers,2017-07-11T01:04:51.197,662
4020,150,0,It helps that C is essentially structured PDP-11 Assembly language  :D,2017-07-11T01:58:22.650,1537
4021,32,1,I'm a bits and bytes guy. I learned back in the day when to build something decently fast you'd write your program in assembly transcode it to decimal numbers then poke it into RAM. As recently as 10 years ago I was on a project where the only way to accomplish what we needed (super fast RFC 4122 compliant UUID on z Series architecture) was to build it in assembly. But that is the only time I have used assembly seriously since the early 1990's.,2017-07-11T02:09:58.990,1537
4023,2573,2,Hi Scott! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Thank you for this very interesting take on this question! I hope to hear more from you around the site.,2017-07-11T03:25:10.103,58
4026,2537,0,I think there is both a question _and_ an answer here. Your personal experience is probably better served as an answer since the question is buried in the text here. Consider bolding it to make it stand out amidst everything else. Also I have a feeling this _might_ be better asked on Academia.SE since the focus sounds university-specific. If you are looking for models of CS programs then you might find there a model to emulate from a non-CS program.,2017-07-11T05:09:28.590,76
4027,2532,0,I feel like several words are being used interchangeably here: field skill understanding and level. To me it's dangerous to conflate these terms. A student's skills != a student's content knowledge. I also would avoid framing students as bad to ... clever. There's also implicitly learning modality being assumed here e.g. the student with musical talent. I think this idea of secondary skill needs to be narrowed; to the student it might be their primary skill. A question just on musical learners or visual artists would more appropriate and precise.,2017-07-11T05:14:09.947,76
4028,2547,19,This is a list question and would be closed on most other sites in the network.,2017-07-11T06:06:48.703,1382
4029,2551,19,Why did you ask on CS Educators instead of [Academia.SE]? There doesn't seem to be anything specific to computer science here.,2017-07-11T06:30:00.973,981
4032,2555,10,there are enough artifacts in the digital file...to be confident of copying. but not to be confident that the copying is not the result of a code theft (supplier was not consenting to this copy). Would'nt this approach punish the victim of a theft along with the thief ?,2017-07-11T08:25:31.980,1855
4036,2553,1,Also -- sure let's encourage people to keep their stuff behind 100 locks. Hell maybe even ban the use of VCSes altogether. Why not approach this like an actual CS professional? Encourage everyone to use Git or Mercurial for their homework -- if there are any suspicions a simple look at the commit history will reveal who's to blame (for plagiarism *et al*).,2017-07-11T08:45:40.890,1856
4039,2577,0,Could this be better asked as how to evaluate a puzzle for use as a CS teaching tool than as a request for a list of puzzles?,2017-07-11T09:20:19.737,104
4044,2573,1,Hi Scott! To me it is OK if one student help other. Even if a part of the code is similar no problem. To me a huge problem happens when several different files are 90-100% equal...,2017-07-11T10:14:16.270,1144
4047,2575,0,Joel I understand what you said and I agree with you. I always have interviews and code reviews with the students. So there goes my question: I  am 100% sure about who really made the work. Should I punish that student? In other answers people are saying that it might have happened involuntarily (GIT ...)... although that might be the case I guess that in most cases the students simply exchange the code between themselves (via Facebook groups Whatsapp ...),2017-07-11T10:21:47.497,1144
4049,2568,1,Ray I agree with all your scenarios and so far I have never punished the original author but as you mentioned that is giving them a sense that they can share what they want. In some way it is kind of holding an exam solution and walk in the classroom showing the solution to the colleagues. The student is just showing the solutions?€? the colleagues may or may not copy them.,2017-07-11T10:29:18.397,1144
4050,2551,1,_@jpmc26 I understand what you say and probably my question should be more clear in that aspect but in fact I am especially interested in programming assignments (copy of source code).,2017-07-11T10:32:03.920,1144

4057,2577,0,David Ginat has done a lot of work with this and has a wealth of exercises. Some has appeared in ACM publications and at SIGCSE conferences. See for example: http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100382337&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0,2017-07-11T11:23:37.080,1293
4058,2578,0,Buffy first of all thank you for such and interesting answer. I also believe that pair/group work are very important especially in CS. The problem is that in the past I've done that but when it came to that part when I asked them: Well who made what? Was it 50-50? Who contributed the most?... Even when I was sure that it was like 80-20 (100-0 in some cases) they would say it was 50-50. :),2017-07-11T11:34:01.450,1144
4059,2578,1,That is why I ask the sort of questions that let them avoid such answers. Not did your partner do his/her share but what did he/she contribute.,2017-07-11T11:42:49.330,1293
4060,1485,0,_@richard Do you mean something like `int(((10000*y2 + 100*m2 + d2) - (10000*y1 + 100*m1 + d1)) / 10000)`? That's a hack. Even though it avoids the conditional I don't think that this is easier to understand for an 11 year old.,2017-07-11T11:44:03.673,877
4061,2547,7,_@BenI. avoid asking subjective questions where ?€? every answer is equally valid Exactly what this is. This is not only an unbounded list question but a list question based on the very subjective What you think is substantial!,2017-07-11T11:54:55.807,1382
4062,2578,0,:) Sure with me that question would also arise immediately after the first one.  But they would have their lesson well study and in the end would still seem like (50-50). Even know I receive pieces of code with almost one comment per line :),2017-07-11T11:56:15.557,1144
4063,2578,0,Hmmm. Excessive comments are a Code Smell of course.,2017-07-11T12:01:06.083,1293
4064,520,1,Brace all is a recognized best practice coding pattern. There are places like the old Bell Labs and its successors at which you get fired if you don't. Lack of bracing in the face of program update is a know bug generator. So @EllenSpertus comment should not be overlooked. Just do it.,2017-07-11T12:21:23.880,1293
4065,2580,0,Welcome to CSEducators Stack Exchange! This is Avery interesting answer. I hope we'll be hearing more from you.,2017-07-11T13:12:33.803,150
4066,2581,0,Hello and welcome to CSEducators Stack Exchange! What a wonderful answer. I hope we'll be hearing more from you.,2017-07-11T13:28:04.003,150
4067,2537,0,_@Peter On questions like this I like to prime the pump a bit to get people thinking. Especially when I don't think there is one true answer. Institutional context matters in this stuff but people with interest can get good ideas from a variety of answers.,2017-07-11T13:29:41.887,1293
4068,2582,0,I think the answer is useful and shows an alternate model.,2017-07-11T13:30:08.390,1293
4070,2583,0,We have several such courses focusing on different aspects of development. Distributing work and coordinating as a team a part of the course (sometimes even the main goal).,2017-07-11T13:34:47.577,1062
4071,2547,3,Every answer is equally valid would be fair if there were no judging criteria but there are strong criteria here. Certainconcepts get covered early on in a CS degree with more or less perfect regularity some get covered sometimes and many concepts *never* get covered. I am not enumerating those sets in this question but they nevertheless exist. The stronger the tie-in to early CS concepts the better the match. This could theoretically be enumerated and statistically matched to find a statistical best answer.,2017-07-11T13:40:09.783,27
4073,2584,0,Do you think I can introduce them to pair programming at this stage?,2017-07-11T14:22:30.137,1871
4074,2585,0,No there is no goal to work in a team. It's about them being able to use the tool.,2017-07-11T14:23:18.480,1871
4075,2584,0,How much experience do they have with computer science?,2017-07-11T14:26:04.110,1511

4078,2584,0,Welcome to Computer Science Educators! This answer is great and if you added parts that address more points which are relevant (more examples explanations etc.) it would be much much better.,2017-07-11T14:41:54.060,150
4079,2553,1,_@D??uris That would depend on your school's policy. If you are free to do what you want after your project is complete and you publish it of course it's not cheating. It's all about the intent?€?did you *willingly* help someone else in full knowledge that this is inappropriate or did they in effect copy from your work without your knowledge and without crediting you?,2017-07-11T14:42:09.243,2

4082,2537,0,I'm not sure what you mean when you say questions like this. Can you clarify this statement? It's helpful for there to be a clear difference between a question and an answer; a self-answered question can serve the same purpose of inspiring thought for further answers. That might be the better approach to take in this circumstance.,2017-07-11T14:56:51.637,76
4083,2586,2,You should explain what the goals of your course are what topics you cover and in which order etc. Off the top of my head I'd think of having students implement a game or something but it seems that's not exactly what you're looking for.,2017-07-11T14:57:35.970,732
4084,2586,0,Thanks @Michael0x2a I have refined the question I hope this is better.,2017-07-11T15:20:39.277,1871
4090,2540,0,_@Kaneki as this is for middle schoolers it would have to be mostly the former with possible simple implementation projects of very simple concepts.  For example a Markov chain would be something these kids would only understand with difficulty.,2017-07-11T16:27:09.473,1015

4099,2551,4,_@jpmc26 Whether a question is on-topic at another site shouldn't matter?€?as long as the question is **on-topic here** it should **stay here** (and from the reception the answer appears to be that it is firmly on-topic here). Overlap between sites is absolutely fine if you want an answer from a specific group (like CS Educators for example rather than general Academians).,2017-07-11T19:19:02.117,2

4107,1079,0,What age range and what kind of personalities are part of the class?  In my experience ethics is not a course where the professor gives their 20 minute speech to the class.  It's a discussion where the professor tries to help the students understand something deeper about how humans work.,2017-07-11T20:53:16.963,812

4109,2559,0,These activities look very intriguing but I think I'd need a little more detail to understand how it would work in the classroom.  I'll check around google but any details you could provide about your learning agent in number 2 or the actual ant colony simulator you are referring to that would be very helpful.,2017-07-11T21:30:28.637,1015
4117,2555,0,_@Joshua your homework code wouldn't be stolen if you weren't doing something unethical with either it or your pc. Other students aren't going to hack your pc. If they are they probably don't need to see your answer.,2017-07-12T01:46:52.767,1906

4133,2601,0,Hi Rahul2001! First off thoughtful student responses are certainly welcome in this community so welcome to [cseducators.se]! This answer has a few problems however. First it violates the [Be Nice](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice) policy. Second it isn't really an answer to OP's question. I have edited for the first problem but the second one only you can fix. *(BTW don't worry we still like you. I promise that you aren't the first person to have trouble with an initial post and you won't be the last!)*,2017-07-12T10:17:07.933,27
4134,2601,0,_@Rahul2001 I understand what you are saying. The teachers can't cover every single student at the same time so to me it is OK if you have a student looking at someone's code to have a board idea about the solution or to overcome a specific difficulty. On the other side I feel that it is not so correct when a student simply grabs the colleagues code and submit the code as being written by themselves.

4217,2632,0,In the C-style languages is it allowed to let step be a default? I.e. is `for (int i = 0; i < 100; ) {` legal and intrepreted as increment `i` by one each step?,2017-07-13T22:48:50.177,104
4218,2632,8,Actually that is legal but is an infinite loop with i always 1. Also: defaults of all kinds are frequent sources of error. Make your programs explicit.,2017-07-13T23:15:16.013,1293
4219,2632,0,I asked because frequently parameters are often set up so that they can be dropped (defaulted) in reverse order (right-to-left). In the case of `for` if that's part of the logic in creating the syntax it can be given as `for (int i = 0; i < 100; ){` or `for (int i = 0 ; ; ){`  but not `for (int i = 0 ; ; i++) {` because the center term is empty while some term to the right is not empty.,2017-07-14T00:12:00.007,104

4222,2634,19,_@thesecretmaster Required to tell the compiler?€? has never been a good reason. And I can only hope that the syntax choice does not affect the optimiser at all. The point is that they are easier to understand *for the programmer(s)* that have to read them. The iteration variable is (supposed to be) initialised and modified only in that single line which makes for a an easily recognisable pattern and correct code where the update step is not forgotten. It also works with `continue;`,2017-07-14T01:45:11.063,660

4227,2632,5,_@GypsySpellweaver any or all of them can be empty in any combination but they all default to nothing (respectively: no initialization no termination except by explicit `break` and no post-loop-body expression).,2017-07-14T05:01:37.400,1970
4228,2639,1,_@D??uris yes. There is a sequence point between the evaluation of the left and right hand sides of the comma operator.,2017-07-14T05:06:13.967,1970
4229,2639,0,(but calling it multiple statements isn't accurate. It's a single expression. And the `int i = 0 int j = 100` part actually isn't valid because that's not how declarations work though it would be without the second `int`).,2017-07-14T05:08:49.587,1970
4230,2632,0,_@hobbs I was suspecting that they were independently empty-legal since they are in essence commands (with the `;` separator) but the habit of what makes sense to the language creators for a parameter list probably had its influence. Having started with a different language with explicit syntax would help the students. Something like `FOR int x = 1 TO 100 STEP 1` leaves no doubt while being less adaptable.,2017-07-14T05:10:51.197,104

4244,2634,6,_@Bergi Keeping the loop control variable in the `for` scope is a practical advantage as well.  The more correct expansion of a `for` loop would be: `{int i = 0; while(i < 100){++i;}}`.,2017-07-14T13:51:26.083,753
4245,2646,0,Hi TecBrat! Thanks for sharing you experience and welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-14T14:44:16.680,58
4246,2647,1,You have a good point about the scope issue though that's less a difference and more an issue of an incomplete translation.   As noted in [@IllusiveBrian's comment](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/2632/teaching-the-humble-for-loop#comment4244_2634) `{}` need to be included to control for scope - which may look unusual since most people don't care enough about scope but it's needed to maintain equivalence.,2017-07-14T15:08:50.790,39
4247,2647,1,For example the `int i = 0; while (i< 100) { /* do something */ i++; }` above should be `{ int i = 0; while (i< 100) { /* do something */ i++; } }`.,2017-07-14T15:11:03.040,39
4248,2647,1,TIL about the purpose of extra code braces.  Thanks!,2017-07-14T15:12:10.687,27
4249,2642,1,That's a clear way to explain loops. I use a similar approach.,2017-07-14T15:31:54.893,1529
4254,2615,0,_@DaveKaye With 25 pupils you only have a 58% probability of two sharing a birthday. $1-\prod_{i=0}^{25} (1-i/365)$ or `1 - reduce(lambda x y: x * y [(1-i/356.0) for i in range(25)])`,2017-07-14T16:20:25.977,204
4258,899,0,I recently asked my pupils to sum the numbers 1?€?100 I gave them 30 seconds. We then looked at how we could do it. We ended up with the formula $(n+1)\times{}n/2$ same as what @PhilMJones did.,2017-07-14T16:26:52.837,204
4261,2615,0,Sounds to me like a great opportunity to discuss the Birthday Problem no?  That's much more my point.,2017-07-14T16:38:42.513,1961
4267,2632,1,_@GypsySpellweaver - No there is no default behavior to a C-style for loop.  The three parts are valid C expressions that don't necessarily have anything to do with indexing a variable.  The expression could read another line of input from a file and the exit test could be checking for <EOF>.  It is very flexible and powerful but you must tell it exactly what you want it to do.,2017-07-14T18:58:11.047,1995
4269,2653,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-07-14T21:22:03.853,27
4271,2632,0,I got a much deeper understanding of `for-loop`s when my teacher started leaving `1` `2` or `3` blank switched the variables in `1` `2` and `3` from `ints` to `booleans` (or even `Strings` in Java) or made loops that required logic in `4` to make `2` true (and `3` was obsolete). I started to understand what each part meant and how to use it instead of assuming `for-loop`s were always increment an int until it hits a certain value.,2017-07-14T21:32:39.470,1578
4275,2659,0,I stand by the pedagogic usefulness of my example though I will add yours into my future discussions of the  tradeoffs. If you add an extra int then there are no limits on power because you could also just add back in the missing sentinel value. But the complexity of the code rises and the fact that you're not given a sentinel in the first place is still a limit of the form itself that you must work around. And without the additional variable the sequential comparison is not possible.,2017-07-14T23:26:26.773,27
4276,2660,0,Hah by the time your learning happens primarily through reading papers you're already getting into the grad school mentality!  For quantum computing in specific you're probably going to need to learn quantum physics.,2017-07-14T23:27:18.147,39
4278,2660,0,_@Nat heh yeah I need to learn more quantum physics but in my rant about papers I neglected to mention - it's kind of fun to feel like you're on the forefront of research though that's just me. And I have to google practically every fifth word. But still it's kind of cool.,2017-07-14T23:48:37.680,919
4280,2659,1,_@BenI: a third alternative you could bring up is implementing a helper function that transforms an iterable into an iterable of pairs and foreach over that. The syntax is still a bit clunky because Java had no built-in syntax for manipulating/destructuring types but it would make the foreach approach clean again/visually similar to the for loop solution. It's perhaps cheating in the context of your exercise since we're not sticking with just foreach loops but this would be a good opportunity to help students start thinking about iteration on a higher level.,2017-07-14T23:59:42.000,732
4282,2660,1,Given your aptitude and attitude it seems like you're going to have a bright future ahead!  Wrote an answer below but short-form reading papers and such is likely a pretty good idea as you develop your core education.  Plus it'll keep your eyes on the prize; the modern school system's meant for people who lead average lives and if you're going at this rate then the standards that it lays out clearly aren't for you.,2017-07-15T00:13:44.060,39
4285,2664,2,Yea never just trust it. Like Thomas Jefferson advised a nephew preparing for his education: _Fix reason firmly in her seat and call to her tribunal every fact every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God_.,2017-07-15T01:46:12.090,104
4286,2654,5,Speaking as a Java programmer not a teacher I only use the old style loops when there is a clear benefit. The foreach loop can compile more efficiently and as Buffy says they prevent common errors that beginners are prone to make but also plague more experienced programmers who get a little lax.,2017-07-15T03:57:26.930,1537

4292,2655,0,I think if you are going to talk about the limits an interesting point to make is that Java's limited support for things like tuples make it harder to implement good solutions inside iterators. Python for example makes part 1 rather easy (`any(first < second) for (first second) in zip(items[1:] items))`). Likewise `C#`'s `ref` returns could be used to solve the second case (although they aren't as far as I know). I think it's valuable to note that the iterator provides a lot of value but in some cases is too limited (by it's design in that language) to solve some problems.,2017-07-15T10:45:51.703,2013
4293,2655,2,Most importantly it's increasingly common for programmers to have to deal with large amounts of data and storing all of your data in memory isn't always possible. Traditional indexing `for` loops are generally useless when dealing with lazy data and so understanding how to do things with iterators rather than indexing means your code can scale far more effectively.,2017-07-15T10:50:49.810,2013
4294,2667,0,Agreed I just posted a comment myself about the ability of iterators to represent unindexable data and agree it's a really important point - iterators are a simpler interface that requires less of your data source meaning they generally scale better. Likewise the things iterators can't do are mostly language limits of Java (no tuples no returning references to items in a list) rather than strict limitations of the concept themselves.,2017-07-15T10:55:25.220,2013
4295,2667,0,I note that I am _especially_ careful when I write code only for myself. Indentation brace all intention revealing names ... All of it. I know that if it is just for me I'll return to it later and don't want to have to de-obfuscate my own code. And I especially don't want to have to add braces to code that omitted it on an update. Get it right. Get it done.,2017-07-15T11:08:05.237,1293
4296,2632,1,A for loop in c style syntax is a shortcut for a while loop with post operation (increment being a common case).  Show the expanded while form then show the for form.,2017-07-15T12:41:47.477,1537
4297,2651,0,Remember some languages have arrays with indexes that are not numeric - the associative array in PHP is like this so database query results and json data.  To loop through an array of this type using a for each style loop is required.  `foreach($array as $key=>$value)` - but then you did specify for Java so these reasons don't exist in your particular use case....,2017-07-15T13:33:27.673,662
4300,2634,0,_@IllusiveBrian creation of the loop variable inside the `for(` statement wasn't possible until C99 allowed it.,2017-07-15T14:24:35.310,1076
4313,2655,0,When the last one turns out to be impossible... `Optional<Double> last = Optional.empty(); for (Double d2 : myDoubles) { if (last.map(d1 -> d2 < d1).orElse(false)) return false; last = Optional.of(d2); }`. Ok it's a *little* harder to understand at first grasp than yours but has the advantage that it's O(n) for all standard collection classes whereas your version is O(n^2) for linked lists and is also thread safe if `myDoubles` is a concurrent collection. And it promotes a way of thinking about the problem that is more generally useful and less fragile than working directly with indices.,2017-07-15T16:55:31.043,848
4314,2663,1,It should be noted that Python isn't the only language where the use of iterated loops is much more common than any other type which is perhaps an important point: you can learn to work with indices rather than iterators in some environments but if you never learn to work effectively with iterators you'll be stumped the moment you try to work in an environment where indexing isn't realistic (e.g. if you try to work in a functional langage where linked lists are the de-facto standard collection and therefore indexing is too slow to be useful for most applications).,2017-07-15T17:08:54.960,848
4315,2659,0,See my comment on @BenI.'s answer: Using `java.util.Optional` makes this *much* simpler because you don't need to have a special case to handle the first iteration (the different behaviour of `Optional.empty()` vs `Optional.as(value)` handles it for you). And this is perhaps an important point here: working in the `foreach` style requires a slightly different approach and the tools to make that approach convenient have taken a while to get here (at least in Java... Optional types have been around for years in functional languages) but now they are it is critical to learn how to use them.,2017-07-15T17:10:46.800,848
4319,2655,0,(and yes I do think these concepts are fundamental enough that they should be taught early enough that students looking at the `foreach` loop should already know about them: the optional container type lambda functions map functions on containers -- we think of them as advanced topics because they were introduced late to most of our popular languages but the different way of thinking about problems they enable can make for much better code in many situations and they should therefore probably be our first choice for tackling most problems so why not teach them first?),2017-07-15T17:35:44.570,848
4320,2634,0,For loops do not optimise better than while loops (at least in gcc clang and visual studio in C and C++). Arguments about easier to read code are sensible.,2017-07-15T17:50:15.630,1611
4321,2686,0,Welcome to CS Educators Stack Exchange! I hope we see more answers and questions from you.,2017-07-15T18:11:16.623,283
4322,2663,2,`i` and `x` are the exact opposite of what I'd expect for element and index variabes.,2017-07-15T18:13:07.950,2021
4323,1002,1,These documents from ACM and IEEE tend to be updated about every 10 years.,2017-07-15T18:23:52.007,541
4324,2663,2,Comparing a foreach to a while loop rather than to a regular for loop is not particularly a fair comparison.,2017-07-15T18:29:50.450,541
4325,2634,0,Won't this lead to teaching the Duff's device? That's not a path I'd recommend with students this fresh.,2017-07-15T19:28:50.913,1504
4328,2651,1,I'd just like to say that for the past couple years I've been using languages that don't have a c-style for loop. I never missed it.,2017-07-15T20:16:10.340,2025
4329,2689,1,I wonder if you've had to retrieve notes from fifty years ago. Your prescription for safekeeping is good but only if you follow it faithfully. Libraries have a lot of trouble with electronic records. So yes do all this but never fail. Attend to it say monthly. The cloud won't save you either. Companies fail taking your stuff into the aether.,2017-07-15T21:01:36.427,1293
4332,2687,1,This may sound like an odd question but what is your goal?  Is the purpose of the note-taking to have a reference for later or is it to get the most information into your mind as you read? Following the cognitive research the latter goal can lead to a very different process than the first.,2017-07-15T21:40:00.740,27
4333,2688,1,**_In fifty years you will still be able to use those notes whereas the computer notes are likely inaccessible._**  Really have to disagree there.  While there's a need to avoid proprietary formats electronic notes have far more endurance through time than paper.  You can back 'em up search through them transfer them share them parse them translate them (via Google Translate-like services) etc..  By contrast 50-year-old paper notes are a pain to recover; they take forever to navigate they're often faded and the paper's wrinkly they're usually in a box somewhere etc..,2017-07-15T21:43:39.937,39
4334,2688,0,As a researcher I've kept all of my notes - paper and electronic - but honestly the paper notes are in a box in the basement.  I mean seriously even if you know exactly what you're looking for it takes forever to dig through them all to find that exact thing.  But on the computer I just do a directory search through all of my documents for keywords and I have all of my related notes in seconds!  It's so much easier.,2017-07-15T21:45:58.120,39
4336,2688,0,My experience is just the opposite. I've lost electronic goods but been able to retrieve work from the early 60's that was on paper. But yes it takes forever. Papyrus and stone tablets are still readable after millennia. But you can have the cake and eat it too. Work electronically but back up by printing to good paper. Keep it dry and away from mice of course. Though I don't know the expected lifetime of laser printed work. I'd guess not permanent.,2017-07-15T21:52:58.803,1293
4337,2688,0,Why backup to paper or use it at all though?  Just backup on other devices the cloud etc..  Nothing short of the world ending will destroy remotely distributed copies but any sort of paper can go up in a fire or simply be lost.  Plus it's just not very usable and whatnot.,2017-07-15T21:56:30.800,39
4338,2642,1,The do while and while loops stated aren't exactly equivalent. If after initialization condition is false then you never execute statement+update in the while loop but in the do-while loop you  always execute statement+update at least once. This could easily lead to confusion.,2017-07-15T21:58:46.353,2026
4340,2642,0,_@Batman Absolutely. That would be part of a broader instruction on the differences between and among these three loop constructs. Nevertheless the general pseudocode holds true.,2017-07-15T22:05:44.260,76
4341,2689,2,You may wish to add comments about LaTeX to your answer - it's a very nice non-proprietary math-friendly editor. Otherwise this is a *fabulous* answer - I should start doing this! Currently I just have a heck of a lot of messy paper notebooks.,2017-07-15T22:20:57.460,919
4342,2687,0,_@BenI. to be honest both are useful to me. I went back and forth on this and in general I can figure out what's going on but not necessarily remember it. I find writing notes helps solidify the information in my mind (along with problems/programs/practice of course) and also is handy for a later reference. I can't tell you how many times I've had to check my linear algebra notes (for example) for the definition of an eigenvector or whatever just because I don't use linear algebra often enough.,2017-07-15T22:23:49.597,919
4343,2529,0,I love those videos and use them all the time. I like how they have diverse presenters who have real and interesting industry jobs. And the explanations are very well done.,2017-07-15T22:50:02.370,541
4349,520,0,Loops (or any method) that is more than a few lines long should usually be refactored into smaller methods.,2017-07-16T01:04:07.317,1537
4352,2651,5,Can you share your reasons *why* you dislike it?,2017-07-16T07:07:07.290,660
4353,1262,0,I think this question as of the current edit (2017-07-15 15:44Z) is still too broad. In essence it asks for a lesson on DNA/RNA and a lesson on a computer science concept that could be useful with that type of data _and_ a lesson that creates a integrates the two to demonstrate how computers can be used in other fields. How about narrowing it to a single lesson based around a specific set of life science needs and a targeted CS concept. CS educators may or may not know the material from the other discipline so it needs to be provided prior to the lesson.,2017-07-16T08:42:03.693,104
4354,1264,0,Possibly a good AP bio lesson. It uses a computer as a tool and you _explanation_ during the run show how the same tool (alignment) can be used in other areas as well. What is the __computer science_ concept that is supposed to be taught by this example?,2017-07-16T08:49:09.180,104
4355,1262,0,You mention the NCBI activity being implemented in ~1000 US high schools. Is that public or private? Are the specialized schools (sometimes called magnet schools). Counting only the estimated 22000 public high schools in the US that's a mere 4??%. What are the statistics on the success of that activity and the programs it has been implemented in?,2017-07-16T08:52:40.837,104
4356,2688,1,My  friend the archivist was discussing this a few years ago. She told me that the most crappy acid ridden paper would last 50 years and archivist paper could last a few hundred. If you write it on velum then longer. Where as she was struggling to get digital information past 10 years. Things become obsolete. You need to actively manage it transferring it from one medium to another and then be lucky enough to to suddenly loose it.,2017-07-16T10:21:41.280,204
4358,2689,0,While I share the enthusiasm for legible typed notes it's worth to issue a warning against solely relying on typing.There's some evidence from psychological studies suggesting handwritten notes are better for actual learning opposed to conserving content because you are forced to summarize what's said. Also e.g. in lectures computers are highly distracting not only for yourself but for your peers as well. Personally if I'm not in a programming class I prefer to take handwritten notes and type or scan them later. Takes a bit more time but is usually worth the effort (at least for me).,2017-07-16T10:36:15.180,2031
4360,2688,0,_@richard Weird; I've still got all of my notes personal information etc. from throughout my life.  It's never been a struggle.,2017-07-16T11:10:33.913,39
4362,2689,0,The interesting discussion which was occuring here should be continued  [in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/62312/discussion-on-answer-by-nat-note-taking-for-self-studying).,2017-07-16T11:33:21.757,58
4363,2695,1,Hi Sie! Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope to see you contributing your knowledge elsewhere as well.,2017-07-16T11:56:42.143,58
4364,2689,0,1330300800 is 2012-02-27 (not 2013-02-27),2017-07-16T13:12:28.197,204
4366,2635,0,I edited to remove one of the women you mentioned because I didn't think she was relevant to the question. Feel free to rollback if you'd like!,2017-07-16T13:44:49.647,919
4369,2698,5,_@nocomprende while I agree with what you are saying we must be interpreting the results wrong. For how do we explain young children programming in scratch without first learning how a transistor works? I think the foundation that we build on can be how it works (how in this language it is implemented). Or it could be based on what it does. It is a reference so it is like a URL or an index entry in a book.,2017-07-16T14:04:25.980,204
4372,2691,1,Java and the other similar languages have garbage collectors. Leaving it undefined lets a reference cooperate with the garbage collector depending on implementation. The pointer in the reference may not point directly to the object's storage but to something managed by GC. C has no need to do this.,2017-07-16T14:14:04.763,1293
4375,2692,9,This doesn't require knowledge of pointers.  It's rather easy to explain to students that you can have two different objects that are identical but are just copies of each other.  That way `Object.new` creates a new identical function reference.  (Which incidentally is basically how Java does it),2017-07-16T14:49:16.453,2034
4376,2694,1,Thanks for the interesting new angle. As we know [COBOL will always be with us](http://abstrusegoose.com/323).,2017-07-16T14:55:45.390,51
4377,2548,0,Moved other women to CW answer.,2017-07-16T15:01:08.937,919
4381,2608,0,I removed the women who I didn't think were relevant to the question (relevant to topics in introductory CS classes). Feel free to rollback if you disagree!,2017-07-16T15:54:18.350,919
4382,2699,0,I watched the videos. At ?? way they had covered everything I know including object orientation but had not yet introduced variable mutation. It made me go ?€?Wow?€? and realise how little of the time we need to mutate a variable.,2017-07-16T15:58:38.697,204
4383,2700,2,Really wonderful answer. *But my college also lacks a Software Engineering track and I would argue most people pursuing a CS education actually want that instead of the science.* is exactly right. Come by the [chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) to say hi and welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-16T16:33:55.207,27
4389,2701,0,Hi FluxIX! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! I hope to see you around asking and answering.,2017-07-16T19:02:51.407,58
4390,2550,0,I removed the mention of the second computer to make your answer more focused; feel free to rollback if you disagree with the edit.,2017-07-16T20:10:08.043,919
4392,2540,0,Numerical optimization in particular Newton's method should be taught before ANN and AI.  By 7th grade most students should have enough development to understand 1-D Newton's method (even if it terms of a line's slope $m$ rather than the point-value of the derivative $x'{\equiv}{\left.\frac{\text{d}f\left(x\right)}{\text{d}x}\right|}_{x_0}$) so that seems like a great time to teach it!,2017-07-16T20:33:31.663,39
4393,2704,1,Nice answer. Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-16T20:40:59.437,27
4395,2705,0,Hi Jerry! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Thanks for this very interesting answer! I hope to see you around doing more asking or answering!,2017-07-16T20:51:25.667,58
4398,2634,0,I would like to add that even though the while and for loops may be the same in practical terms I would favor new programmers using the for loop as it makes it much less likely to accidentally produce an infinite loop.,2017-07-16T21:07:17.817,2044
4401,2692,1,I wasn't saying that we are copying function references.  Rather that they are copies (meaning that they look identical).  That said duplicates is likely a better word.,2017-07-16T21:54:48.047,2034
4403,2708,0,Hyper-clarity *is* teaching well. This is an excellent exercise. Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-07-16T22:14:24.233,27
4405,2698,0,_@alephzero (BenI. and richard and anyone else who wants to discuss) Feel free to continue this interesting conversation in [this new room in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/62334/discussion-on-answer-by-richard-is-it-important-to-teach-pointers-in-a-first-cou).,2017-07-16T22:32:43.800,58
4406,2708,1,This isn't _just_ an answer; it also has useful material in it that'd be of general value to educators.  At current SE.CSEducators doesn't really have a good mechanism for promoting this content though there might be an argument for cloning StackOverflow's recent Documentation feature here - just instead of being documentation on programming it'd be a repository of teaching material.,2017-07-16T22:53:18.007,39
4407,2708,1,_@Nat That actually sounds like a fantastic idea! If you want to create a meta question requesting it. It's certainly unprecedented but it's worth asking :),2017-07-16T22:59:36.487,58
4408,2708,0,_@Nat (and nova) I forgot to mention come by the [chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom). We'd love to meet you!,2017-07-16T23:00:43.923,27
4409,2692,0,How would the explanation be harder to understand if we said *this can be understood because `a` and `c` both **reference** the same Object in memory while `b` **references** a different object*?,2017-07-16T23:02:36.957,660
4410,2691,22,Learning pointers is already quite hard ... but if you feel the need for an extra challenge try learning what pointers are in a language which does not have pointers ...,2017-07-17T00:40:57.617,2048
4411,2691,18,Whatever you do don't talk about pointers in Java. Java does not have pointers. You can teach references that's fine and necessary. Especially don't try to teach about memory addresses or pointer arithmetic because *those are not things in Java*.,2017-07-17T01:04:50.287,1275
4413,2691,27,If there are no pointers in Java how do you get a NullPointerException? :),2017-07-17T02:34:56.250,2045
4414,2718,0,If you read my answer you'll see I disagree with that answer about Java and pass-by-value (for object types). It's not worth arguing though because it's just saying the same thing two different ways.,2017-07-17T04:49:18.727,2025
4415,2718,0,Oh and welcome to [Computer Science Educators](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com)! (I'm almost as new am I qualified to say that?),2017-07-17T04:50:47.700,2025
4416,2718,1,_@CAD97 You certainly are :)  I hope we see more of both of you.,2017-07-17T04:53:17.060,27
4417,2718,0,Hi CAD97 thank you for your comment. I posted my answer to add additional things to your answer because I don't have enough reputation points to post a comments on other people's answers. Anyways you could copy from my answer a link to Java Language Specification where it says that references are pointers to objects. All the best.,2017-07-17T05:01:57.270,2054
4418,2699,0,It also may be that they would not list high schools that use the book. Those lists are a marketing decision and high schools are not the primary audience that they market to. A top university may potentially be dissuaded by seeing high schools on a list for a book they are considering adopting.,2017-07-17T05:04:03.667,27
4419,2691,9,_@nova - that's my go-to example for how the whole no pointers thing in Java is a poorly thought out whitewash.,2017-07-17T05:08:01.243,1301
4420,2632,2,This is why you shouldn't teach basic programming using C. It makes it extra hard to grasp the concept itself...,2017-07-17T11:00:27.593,51
4421,2718,1,CAD97 in C# you can pass by reference with `ref` keyword so you can make a swap function that you cannot make in Java `static void SwapStrings(ref string s1 ref string s2)` . If you omit keyword ref then you get the same behavior like in Java and that is pass by value. If you think that it is pass by reference then how you call it when you use `ref` keyword in C#?,2017-07-17T14:15:36.440,2054
4422,2720,0,Yes I was asking about the first course only. And agree with your comments. +1,2017-07-17T14:21:07.353,1293
4423,2721,1,While all this is true is any of it relevant? The question is about computer scientists not computer operators however skilful one may have needed to be to operate an early computer.,2017-07-17T14:32:58.360,1219
4424,2721,1,_@PeterTaylor - The lines between the two were a lot blurrier back then. But I think I justified this approach in my first paragraph. If you don't buy that argument then I guess your point is quite relevant.,2017-07-17T14:42:53.270,1139
4426,520,0,I presume that `bugs[1] = 0; bugs[1] = 1;` `f[1] = 0; f[1] = 1;` and `fibonacciNums[1] = 0; fibonacciNums[1] = 1;` are all unintentional bugs?,2017-07-17T15:11:07.643,1219
4427,2693,1,+1 I agree that pointers are sufficiently abstracted in reference based languages like Java C# and many others that they do not need to be covered in an introductory programming course.  However one potential pitfall many institutions fall into is the next instructor (for intermediate courses) tends to assume they have already been covered in earlier courses.,2017-07-17T15:22:26.540,2067
4428,520,0,_@PeterTaylor Not intentional and fixed! It made no difference to the final output though. I wanted to put in `fibonacciNums[0] = 0;` purely for clarity's sake as Java arrays are zeroed at instantiation anyway. (I just didn't know if that was a covered concept in OP's class by this point so I thought it better to put that line in.) *Thank you!!*,2017-07-17T15:29:38.300,27
4429,2655,0,Oh. When I saw you talking about the limitations in the question the first one which came to mind is that you can't call `remove()` on the `Iterator` but that doesn't seem to enter into your considerations at all. I see `for (Foo foo : foos) {` as sugar for `for (Iterator<Foo> it = foos.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) { Foo foo = it.next();` but all of the answers seem to be about iterating over arrays rather than collections.,2017-07-17T15:33:17.857,1219
4432,2729,2,I love those stories! I can imagine bringing various Starbucks cups into class for a physical demonstration.... welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we hear more from you in the future!,2017-07-17T16:30:30.890,27
4434,2700,2,I think using the phrase *Java uses pass by reference* is dangerous at best especially when talking about an introductory class. Keep it high level but if any students ask about the nitty-gritty make sure they know that Java is pass by value even for references.,2017-07-17T17:06:20.427,2068
4435,2700,3,I never did grok pointers and constantly had trouble with them when working in languages like C++ (I never could remember if I needed to `*` the variable or `&` and on which *side* that operator needed to go because seriously would it have *killed* someone to make that syntax consistent?). I *hated* pointers. Object references in languages like Java and C#? So easy to understand and use effectively.,2017-07-17T18:22:24.217,1244
4436,2705,1,IMO a null reference exception is pretty easy to understand You tried to use an object that didn't exist. That is you *declared* it but you didn't *define* it. Pointers let you do god awful things like `int val = *somoeObj; val++; Object foo = &val` No really. Why would you do that. Why would you EVER BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT.,2017-07-17T18:27:52.853,1244
4437,2700,0,_@KevinWorkman As I said it's a matter of definitions. When you have a Java binding it _is_ the thing it's bound to; you don't have to `*` it to dereference the pointer. The way Java is implemented is by passing the pointer by value but because the binding _is_ the bound value you're passing the bound value by reference. C's pass-by-reference is a completely different thing to Java's and it's a conflation of definitions. By C's definitions Java is pass-reference-by-value and I will never object to that because it is correct. Just confusing if you don't know pointers inside out.,2017-07-17T18:28:17.590,2025
4438,2700,3,*Just confusing if you don't know pointers inside out.* That's exactly my point. This is for an introductory class. The students do not know pointers inside out.,2017-07-17T18:30:38.120,2068
4441,875,0,Yes testing needs to be seen as integral important and authentically valued. Otherwise it's just another thing for a student to check off the list---and if you're gonna get a good grade anyway why bother?   I tried to teach unit testing in extracurricular support activities but it didn't stick like I'd hoped. Later students started working at tech companies and told me You should really have taught us unit testing. It's so important! It's got to be in the curriculum to be effective imo.,2017-07-17T19:14:08.853,2045
4443,2691,2,_@nova NullPointerException (which I mention to my students too as proof that there are pointers deep down) is a leaky abstraction.,2017-07-17T19:57:12.603,283
4444,2691,3,On the other hand it is conceivable that the exception was badly named. I don't disagree with the comments here but had it been named otherwise (invalid reference exception) would you still worry. But yes Java made compromises in its model.,2017-07-17T19:59:41.123,1293
4447,1299,0,I never really even think about the difference.  I look at it like this:  f(x) = 2x could be called a mathematical function.  But the function as it exists purely has nothing to do with what I just wrote.  A computer program like (lambda (x) (* 2 x)) actually embodies something of that purity.  But (lambda (x) (* 2 x)) is no more a function than f(x) = 2x is.  They are both notations abstractions with shortcomings as well as applications to the genuine mathematical concept.,2017-07-17T20:17:54.243,1089
4449,2692,0,While I love Ruby and hence any mention of it in an answer it has no pointers only references. So not the right answer for the question at hand.,2017-07-17T20:50:42.007,652
4450,2692,1,There's nothing under the hood in your example.  You merely are illustrating the difference between Ruby objects and Ruby variables.,2017-07-17T22:04:06.923,1269
4451,2692,1,Re Why are 2 empty Objects the same but the other 2 are not?  There's no other 2 in your example:  It only creates two objects.  `a` `b` and `c` are _not_ objects.  They are _variables_.  They _refer to_ objects and in particular `a` and `c` refer to the same object while `b` refers to a different object.,2017-07-17T22:06:44.543,1269

4453,2700,5,Did you mean grok when you typed grep?  That's a funny typo.  :),2017-07-17T22:58:24.240,1103
4454,2700,1,This answer is misleading at best and potentially dangerously wrong. Java most definitely does **not** have call-by-reference semantics. (Compare [this question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480) and also the large amount of confusion in [this other Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419).) Too many people try to conflate call-by-reference with reference types so it's important to distinguish those concepts early before a wrong mental model sets in.,2017-07-18T00:22:20.457,2074
4455,2700,2,_@DanielPryden Did you read that paragraph? I've read that answer. I acknowledge immediately that Java is _pass reference by value_. The difference is that I (and Java by my reading) consider a binding _to be indistinguishable from_ the bound value so passing a reference is passing a reference to that bound value not the binding itself thus passing the reference by value. It's not comparable to C/++ where a pointer/reference and the value itself are different things. EDIT: your grace period edit makes clearer what you mean. I don't disagree.,2017-07-18T00:27:18.260,2025
4456,2700,0,_@CAD97: I've edited my comment while you were responding. I think that that's exactly the crux of my point: I believe it's essential to distinguish between a binding and a bound value. The Java language makes this non-obvious but that just serves to confuse students later when they discover values being mutated through multiple references. I think it's much better to address this source of confusion head-on.,2017-07-18T00:30:32.290,2074
4457,2693,3,Irrespective of the importance I can't say I shared your experience. Even having never programmed in assembly or seriously in C/C++ (just a couple college projects well after I had learned Java used pointers) I had no trouble grasping the idea that Java has your object's data in a separate block (over on the heap) and that the variable I'm using at the moment actually just corresponds to an address pointing to that block. Granted that's a bit simplistic but I didn't find the basic concept of pointers that hard and even that limited understanding made Java's behavior more sensible.,2017-07-18T00:36:14.020,981
4458,2700,1,_@DanielPryden If the binding _is_ the value and you pass the reference _to that value (by value)_ (`func(&*ptr)`) you get what Java does and what we're both describing. Coming from a pointer understanding the question in question describes the exact behavior. Coming from Java's angle though my argument is that _binding is its value_ plus _pass by reference to that value_ plus _value lives somewhere in memory_ is the better way to explain it without leaking the abstraction away from pointers. But I'm not going to argue the point; we're in agreement with different terminology definitions.,2017-07-18T00:37:00.210,2025
4460,2702,1,Although we like to expose our students at NCSSM to more than one language so they see the commonalities.   B''sides it is not languages that are important it is the problem-solving process. Languages are tools.  Architectures vary according to purpose.,2017-07-18T01:44:56.670,21

4466,2740,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Nice insights here.,2017-07-18T11:46:03.423,27
4468,2691,1,I think it is important to use the Java terminology even when it doesn't match the rest of the industry.  So call it a reference not a pointer (even though it is much more like a C++ pointer than reference) it is important to teach the concept early otherwise comparing strings versus comparing int's makes no sense.,2017-07-18T12:55:44.457,2084
4469,2705,0,_@Wildcard I have now and I can respect that opinion. Not sure how much I agree (at least half?),2017-07-18T13:04:49.430,1244
4470,2737,1,Oh yes I remember that story of Mel. Is a cute story but code like that is fundamentally unmaintainable which the story also shows. Real software can't work like that because (unethical or not) change requests come in and you can't just add a new feature to golf'ed code.,2017-07-18T13:12:31.933,1244
4471,2693,1,_@LeeHiles C# also has pointers so that's not quite as good an example. Not quite as raw as C's but then again C's aren't quite as raw as assembly's. E.g. there's no null pointer in assembly that's a C construct; a pointer in assembly isn't necessarily a single integer; two pointers can point to the same memory despite having different values (*and vice versa*); I've got more where those came from :P In contrast I've seen plenty of programs in C or Pascal that avoided pointers almost entirely (not counting indexing a statically allocated array as using pointers).,2017-07-18T13:13:36.700,1816
4472,2698,2,_@nocomprende Surely learning abstractions first then delving into into the detail behind them is how we learn almost everything?,2017-07-18T13:54:45.970,1218
4473,2691,5,[JLS Section 4.3.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.3.1) The reference values (often just *references*) are **pointers** to these objects and a special null reference which refers to no object. Any assertion that Java doesn't have pointers is wrong. Maybe you want to just stick to the terminology of references but don't confuse the students with all the garbage about how Java passes objects by reference and primitives by value.  Everything is passed by value. The value of the references is a pointer.,2017-07-18T15:16:10.823,2087
4474,2612,0,Would you be interested in non-physical games too? I have a few activities + materials from a week-long summer orientation for college freshmen but mostly in a seated group work format with Peer Instruction style discussion.,2017-07-18T15:31:56.620,2045
4476,2651,1,Yikes I hope you're not suggesting you wouldn't teach students about the `foreach` loop if you weren't forced to by your curriculum!,2017-07-18T16:11:16.887,1218
4479,2698,0,_@nocomprende Ah I see I think we're talking about slightly different things here. There's abstracting as in discarding an irrelevant to detail to get a more general result. Like starting by adding apples then moving to addition as a concept that works for anything. But there's also abstracting as in hiding the inner workings. Like how if you know how to operate a VCR player you also know how to operate a DVD player- the differences are abstracted behind a common interface. Natural sciences have a lot of examples of learning from more abstract -> more detailed in this second meaning,2017-07-18T16:39:32.513,1218
4480,2698,1,e.g. period table -> molecules and atoms -> quantum field theory. You certainly wouldn't want to do that in the reverse order in large part because as you say it's better to start with concrete accessible examples. And I'd suggest that learning about the workings of a computer is similar. Scratch exists because creating simple programs is accessible and concrete. Building understanding all the way up from transistors would be the opposite.,2017-07-18T16:40:49.413,1218
4483,2691,2,I think my experience is quite different from yours. Also my conclusions. Everything is a Turing Machine but I don't need to wind the tape.,2017-07-18T16:49:36.187,1293

4502,2609,1,I was not the DV but you say that the MIT license is *abusing the power that the school has over the students*. How so?

4527,2609,1,_@BenI This is not so. The thing that would stop the student from creating a proprietary fork would be if the school took the copyright from the student. The GPL licence will not do it. If a software is licences under GPL then any copyright holder is free to re-licence under any licence that they wish. Including proprietary.,2017-07-19T15:51:39.873,204
4528,2609,0,The GPL is a copyleft license which means that derivative work **can only be distributed under the same license terms**. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. (Emphasis mine) ([Link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)),2017-07-19T16:01:17.107,27
4529,2609,1,_@BenI. A licence is a contract between 2 parties. In this case the copyright holder and anyone that need to be to avoid being in copyright infringement. As you can not be in breach of contract with yourself and the student is the copyright holder. Then the student is free from the contract and thus may re-licence any way they like.

4565,2691,1,_@nocomprende I agree entirely that they need to learn these concepts (and preferably early on) but Java isn't the language to do it in.

Do you have any alternative career suggestions for people interested in education and CS if traditional K-12 teaching is off the table? Community college? Non-profits?,2017-07-20T02:17:47.797,2045
4574,2780,0,I am just letting you know what is out there. People don't like it and I don't care.  Proceed with caution.,2017-07-20T02:18:16.907,21
4575,2780,0,Community colleges hire a lot of adjuncts and pay them McDonald's wages.  Some don't.  Exercise care. A niche can exist here but don't allow yourself to be abused.,2017-07-20T02:21:18.003,21
4576,2783,0,Welcome to [CSEducators.se]! Wow! This is a wonderful answer. I hope we'll be hearing more from you.,2017-07-20T10:49:29.107,150
4578,2700,1,[Pass by reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_reference) means that a called method can reassign *the caller's* variables to a distinct value. A good litmus test is whether you can write a function that swaps the caller's variables. Java doesn't enable this style of programming. Yes it shoves the object on the heap and the object can be mutated. But that isn't what pass by reference means; it means that full access to the caller's local variable is given. At this point though the matter is so widely confused that I'm not sure the terms have value anymore.,2017-07-20T11:55:22.703,981
4579,2700,0,In other words contrary to your post script the binding **is very much** separate from the value. And what's worse understanding that the binding is a separate thing from the value is fundamental to understanding how Java works.  I can assign a list to `x` add some elements and then assign it `y`. Reassigning `x` to a new list and adding elements to that doesn't change the list bound to `y`. Also how else could you make sense of the fact that two variables can be assigned the same value simultaneously?,2017-07-20T12:02:16.930,981
4583,2784,0,Yes. Good point about experience. I've been able to provide real-world examples and best practices to my students. They typically appreciate that.,2017-07-20T13:33:30.933,1529
4592,2773,1,I have been in private beta but was not happy about it. :( Now it seems to getting better.,2017-07-20T14:58:00.913,38
4593,2773,0,Then welcome back! :),2017-07-20T15:01:57.033,27
4596,2780,1,_@nocomprende Sounds like _driven_ applies. Good on you.,2017-07-20T17:06:17.327,1293
4598,2793,6,What about functions and procedures.,2017-07-20T17:43:36.450,204
4600,2793,0,You also need to consider separately mutating variables and non-mutating variables. The later should be taught first.,2017-07-20T17:57:54.693,204
4601,2791,1,Actually it is a bit more subtle. I tell (told) my students that it isn't my job to teach you what I know (much of which is obsolete anyway) but (a) to teach you what _you need  to know_ and (b) teach you how I think. That was normally how I stated it but I'd have improved (b) to teach you how to think. Less personal. In particular I didn't need to recapitulate my history in CS that got me to the current point of knowledge.,2017-07-20T17:58:02.800,1293
4602,2793,2,Also consider using Objects as easier (to be done before) creating objects.,2017-07-20T17:58:45.477,204
4604,2796,1,I think that in SICP they would much rather not have included explicit state (variables) at all but then decided that Functional Programming wasn't the _entire_ world. Sadly. An somewhere optimization of programs would perhaps need to be done. ;-),2017-07-20T18:05:23.127,1293
4606,2791,1,Yes. Experts often make poor teachers as they don't understand learning finding some things too easy. The best Tai Chi teacher for a beginning student is probably not the Master of the legacy rather someone who understands the struggle. Eventually though go to the Master. Actually that is wisdom from one of the Masters himself.,2017-07-20T18:07:31.360,1293
4608,2791,0,Tai Chi is a life long process. The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is _right now._  I started at about 60 years old.,2017-07-20T18:13:49.730,1293
4613,2796,0,_@Buffy they had to do mutation because without it a random-number function is a complete mess. A random number function is not a function it has internal state (if you have mutation). With out mutation you end up with a pure function now the only place for the state is in the stack this breaks modularity as now the user of the function is keeping the state and it is well ugly. In most other cases it is best to avoid mutation; It is more elegant without it. Secondly a functional language with lambdas can just go and implement mutation and banning lambdas would be a big mistake.,2017-07-20T18:30:08.097,204
4618,2796,1,_@nocomprende variables are not a problem mutation is a problem (mostly see comment to buffy). If you avoid ever reusing a variable then your code will be more elegant easier to read easier to optimise less buggy ?€? The only place where this is impossible is in loop counters. This is why scheme uses recursion. However sometimes it is better to use mutation (but not much). Programs should be 80% to 90% functional and mutation should be encapsulated.,2017-07-20T18:35:17.690,204
4622,2798,0,setup and draw are procedures not functions (though C and its derivative incorrectly call them functions).,2017-07-20T18:39:15.933,204
4624,2798,1,_@richard In an introductory course the distinction does not matter. (I would go a step further and say the distinction doesn't matter in real life either but I digress.) Processing calls these functions so they're functions in Processing. In more advanced courses you can make a distinction between procedures and functions but at an introductory level functions tell the computer to do stuff is about all you should be saying.,2017-07-20T18:42:01.257,2068
4626,2795,0,Yes I understand and agree. But we would likely still disagree.,2017-07-20T18:44:30.767,1293
4627,2796,0,_@nocomprende I can't remember when they covered domain specific languages in SICP probably before mutation. They use scheme (the language that they are teaching in) to define the language all but the lexer. Then they wrote the lexer in scheme. All functional. ?€? the real power of functional is that it will make you program better in other languages.,2017-07-20T18:46:15.330,204
4628,2796,1,_@richard actually I would say that variables (explicit capture of state for later testing especially) **is** a problem. But this isn't the place for such a discussion. Why remember something for later action if you can capture the action itself (either in an object (OOP) or an expression (Functional). Your background leads you to a different conclusion than mine of course.,2017-07-20T18:48:36.293,1293
4629,2798,1,The importance of the distinction between function and procedures is that if we make the distinction then they have the same meaning as in real life: functions as in maths procedures as in follow the correct procedure. The other importance is in which one we teach first.,2017-07-20T18:51:44.230,204
4630,2795,0,_@nocomprende top down or bottom up: what we are trying to do first or how it is done first: human first or machine first.,2017-07-20T18:56:24.463,204
4631,2797,1,To support using objects before creating them start with an already built framework that the students work within so that the most primitive thing they see is an object with behavior and that can interact with others. You build this or find one and the students extend it. Karel J Robot is an example of this way of thinking. Unfortunately it overuses inheritance a bit so needs to be used with some care and thought.,2017-07-20T18:58:14.183,1293
4632,2798,2,_@richard I guess I'll respectfully disagree with you here. At no point in my career have I needed to stop and remember whether I was writing a function or a procedure. So I wouldn't recommend spending any time making the distinction in an intro course where students are already going to be inundated with new information. Maybe you just teach a different kind of course than I would. :p,2017-07-20T19:00:28.323,2068

4638,2793,2,_@richard : In real computer hardware functions and non-mutating variables as computation results don't exist.  The program counter jumps and state bits mutate.  Why jump to an abstraction so early?,2017-07-20T19:51:04.130,59

4644,2795,0,_@nocomprende I hardly use the memory register of my calculator. You don't need it if the calculator does BODMAS or is stack based (reverse polish). I guess to understand functional you have to understand functional. But I agree that starting at both ends seems like the way to go.,2017-07-20T21:27:19.977,204
4645,2793,0,_@hotpaw2 that is just one way to make the hardware. **As for why: mutation is one of the hardest concepts to grasp.** And even after you get/grok it there are a lot of mistakes to be made even by experienced experts.,2017-07-20T21:31:42.950,204
4647,2751,1,The `nand` `not` and `nor` gates are impossible with dominoes. How would you have a gate that starts toppling its output if there is no input? Where would it get power? How would it know when to do this? (it is late in the circuit so topples the output but then as the logic ripples through has to un-topple it.

4672,2795,2,_@Richard You are missing the point. *The number that is shown on the calculator display is stored in a variable.* And if you insist that calculators should have a reverse polish interface because that satisfies your prejudices about the one and only way to design software properly IMO your whole philosophy is bass ackwards so far as real world computer system design is concerned.,2017-07-21T05:40:22.563,1352

4675,2795,0,_@alephzero no I have the point I know where you are coming from I just don't think it is the **best** place. And reverse polish is just one option the other as stated is BODMAS. If you have ether of these then you need no explicit registers. However you may reuse an answer from the display not because you have to but because it is easier. Usually to avoid typing the formula in again. But if you can recall the formula it is usually easier in the long run to fix the formula (that way there is no implicit program than making it easier to fix and reason with).,2017-07-21T10:08:57.153,204

4692,2811,2,Why `while` before `for`?

4707,2831,0,I think oracle (or was it sun micro-systems) read that interfaces form a contract and then noted that they had something that they called an interface and then wrongly concluded that they were constructing contracts.

5735,2700,1,CAD97 of course the essence of your answer about pointers is more important then terminology you used and I agree with your answer but anyways I am curious about the terminology you use because it is not standard and it can confuse a lot of people. In C# you can pass by reference with ref keyword so you can make a swap function that is impossible to make in Java: `static void SwapStrings(ref string s1 ref string s2)` . If you omit keyword ref then you get the same behavior like in Java. If you call that default behavior pass by reference then how you call it when you use ref keyword in C#?,2017-07-22T02:50:25.470,2054
5736,2700,0,_@CodesInTheDark Terminology is hard. The way I'd explain C#'s `ref` keyword is <del>by pretending it doesn't exist</del> probably saying that while `string s` is a binding to a string `ref string s` is a binding to a binding to a string. So instead of passing the reference to the string you're passing the reference to your binding to the string. (That's starting to sound like pointers... and `ref` (plus naming) is the one thing I don't like about C#.),2017-07-22T03:13:40.627,2025

5760,2797,1,To explain houses from bricks I like using a historical approach.  Show them an abacus human computers with mechanical adders Baggage engine core memory big enough to see each bit.  Throw in some stories about Ada Turing Shannon and Hopper (the recent movie Hidden Figures) to keep them interested.  Humans made lots of bricks way before learning to make beautiful cathedrals.  Teaching engineering and science is a bit different from teaching Art appreciation.,2017-07-22T17:25:19.943,59
5762,2693,1,_@jpm26 java was invented about 20 years after I learned about pointers. I came through BASIC that was still close enough to its Fortran roots to be recognizable as such (no scope so no distinction between references and values)  into pascal and C. We have had different experiences for sure.,2017-07-22T17:54:18.717,1537
5774,2795,0,(1) why - I don't believe that students need to recapitulate the history of computing to learn how to program. A modern language provides a complete consistent model in which to think and program without needing to map to lower level abstractions. The mapping is in fact extra work.,2017-07-22T21:15:33.570,1293
5775,2795,0,(2) how - I don't start with a bare machine and a sort of math-y problem. I start with a simulation of some type that already has objects in it (I use Java mostly) that can be (a) composed and (b) extended. Look at http://greenfoot.org or better http://greenroom.greenfoot.org for many examples that you can utilize and adapt. It is also a good beginner user environment that shows both program structure and graphic simulations. Start high. Move higher. When they get some experience with the complete consistent language environment then (only then) show the map to the netherworld of bits.,2017-07-22T21:18:54.967,1293
5782,2847,1,Hello and welcome to Computer Science Educators! Thanks for your answer; I hope to continue seeing you around the site.,2017-07-22T22:47:25.340,919
5784,2850,0,Thank you for sharing your insight as an AP CS exam reader. I'll look for more of your answers.,2017-07-23T03:13:15.363,283
5785,2850,0,Good points!  I'd also be extremely interested in your insights on [this](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/143/designing-rubrics-for-ap-computer-science-style-free-response-questions) question as well.,2017-07-23T04:14:10.457,27
5786,2854,0,Wow! This is a very good answer. Welcome to [cseducators.se] I hope we'll be hearing more from you.,2017-07-23T04:54:58.233,150
5787,2831,0,_@richard perhaps intended contract is a better term. It certainly can't be enforced in Java. But the software is generally better if everyone agrees to behave as if it were.,2017-07-23T11:05:35.467,1293
5788,2856,0,java enforces that an implementing class actually ***`implements`*** the method signatures defined in the interface. Anything that implements a specific interface is promising that you can work and use ***only*** the parts that are from the interface (`Interface objectName = new ImplementingClass()`). At compile time you can use anything that `Interface` says but not what `ImplementingClass()` can do which isn't related to the interface. My point is that I'm not sure I understand why you say that `intent` is the only thing enforced.,2017-07-23T11:35:58.307,150
5789,2831,0,_@Buffy but where is the behaviour agreed? I can see that you can use good-names and you could but the contracts into comments. I could agree that this is an implicit contract if the names are good e.g. draw_line(start: point end: point) we would expect this to draw a line between two points.,2017-07-23T11:59:58.890,204
5790,2856,0,Declaring variables with the interface type is good style but unfortunately only style and that isn't enforced.,2017-07-23T12:11:34.337,1293
5791,2831,0,_@richard and anything implementing that interface **must** implement `draw_line` method (which means write a method body). Btw I'm sorry for the confusion. I mistagged the question. Now I see that tagging with [tag:java] is needed.,2017-07-23T12:14:41.213,150
5792,2840,0,Thanks for the thoughts but you are mistaken in a few points. VBA is practically VB6 so it is dated but not dreadful. It is by no means a good choice as a general purpose programming language but the question was not about that. VBA is the best option for MS Office automation. About viruses: VBA enabled Office documents expose the whole system to the VBA code and that is what makes it risky - practically the VBA code can be the virus. For the last paragraph: I think I need to teach VBA because corporations pay big $$$ for me to teach VBA to their employees - simple as that. :),2017-07-23T13:55:38.083,51
5793,2840,0,Don't get me wrong VBA is not great. When corporate employees start using a lot of VBA macros that usually means they are stretching way beyond the limits of Excel. In most cases they would be better off using some RDBMS or a specialized software. BUT these employees don't have the time nor the knowledge to learn programming in C# for example or to design build and maintain an MS SQL database. But they CAN learn to create simple VBA macros. You'd be amazed at the things they can do after a 4 day intensive VBA training.,2017-07-23T14:00:30.633,51
5794,2819,0,+1 Also if you teach your students JavaFX instead of Swing they've already made experiences with the framework which will probably be used in the future.,2017-07-23T14:36:38.703,793
5795,2819,0,_@TuringTux that's a good point.,2017-07-23T14:39:23.940,150
5796,2867,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. This might be a very good answer but it could really benefit from some explanations and details. Could you add some details and explanations or examples on how to integrate your suggestion into the ap cs a curriculum?,2017-07-23T15:10:50.820,150
5803,282,0,I'm curious how you decided to do it in the end.,2017-07-23T17:20:43.497,150
5804,282,0,It's summer so I haven't reworked the lab yet.  This lab is usually given some time around January so there's plenty of time :),2017-07-23T17:26:33.040,27
5805,282,0,Oh well that makes sense. Still I'd like to see it (if you'll let me :P) after you've reworked it.,2017-07-23T17:27:50.040,150
5810,2818,1,I noticed this is the first question with an ap-cs-a tag.  Perhaps you could re-tag your question with the more used ap-computer-science-a tag?,2017-07-23T18:15:03.193,2145
5811,2871,0,I could not recommend using an sql db in an application. SQL is great for ad-hoc queries but not for creating applications. There are much better choices such as the ones you mentioned. Having said that I would definitely read up on 1st 2nd 3rd normal form. It is essential and also transferable to non-relational DBs.,2017-07-23T18:59:10.857,204
5817,2874,0,I think it's typical when teaching abbreviations to show the non abbreviated version too.,2017-07-23T19:07:23.947,283
5818,2874,0,_@EllenSpertus so I should show both?,2017-07-23T19:07:58.373,150
5819,2877,0,No obligation but since you seem to be posting a lot lately you might want to consider stopping by and saying hi in [the Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) our site chat :),2017-07-23T19:09:06.730,27
5821,2880,0,_@richard As I understand there is no such guarantee at least in Java: `x = truefalse() ? badSideEffectMethod1() : badSideEffectMethod2();`,2017-07-23T19:12:46.117,27
5822,2880,0,Actually evaluating the predicate or subepressions may have side effects. The difference is whether statements can go in the arms for languages where statements and expressions differ.,2017-07-23T19:14:05.123,283
5823,2874,0,For the 2nd example I would go with a `for` loop.,2017-07-23T19:14:17.353,204
5824,2874,0,_@richard fair point.,2017-07-23T19:14:46.477,150
5825,2880,0,_@BenI. What do you mean by no guarantee? I didn't fully understand.,2017-07-23T19:15:59.897,150
5826,2880,0,I thought I understood until @EllenSpertus said what she just said.  Let's move this conversation to [chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom)?,2017-07-23T19:17:27.700,27
5827,2880,0,The compiler (java C# C++ etc) does not check that each of the terms are pure functions (have no side effect).,2017-07-23T19:17:27.910,204
5828,2874,1,Yes show both at first.,2017-07-23T19:22:45.447,283
5830,2878,1,My take on this is that one should not only try to teach high-practical-low level computational concepts but how all these concept levels connect and build upon one another.,2017-07-23T19:54:26.213,59
5845,2818,0,_@CSCheerleader Good catch. I'll fix that now. Oversight on my part.,2017-07-23T20:58:03.777,76
5852,2883,0,It is domain specific only if the domain in question is student minds. It is not a language for actual robot programming.,2017-07-23T23:04:28.723,1293
5854,2883,0,+1 .  Nitpicky historical point: C was released in 1972.,2017-07-24T00:29:00.030,1537
5855,2883,0,I guess I used the date of the book _The C Programming Language_ not the language itself. Thanks.,2017-07-24T00:31:38.973,1293
5857,2894,4,So in essence you're saying the same as I am but without marketing decisions influencing the market. I certainly have no data to show that games would have targeted girls in a parallel universe so I can't really argue with you. No way to tell.,2017-07-24T01:32:27.833,27
5858,2894,2,_@BenI. Sure I have no problem with your answer. I was annoyed that nobody suggested mine as a possibility. Before we can solve a problem we need to know if it is solvable.,2017-07-24T01:58:48.487,2149
5862,2894,2,Having done a BTEC in game design a HND in computing and an AS level in Psychology I'm quite convinced that interest is one of the driving forces. My BTEC class had one female who was more interested in the stories than the technology. My HND class had 3 females 2 were there because they already had IT jobs at the college (odd considering they weren't very IT literate) 1 sat quietly in the corner and ended up leaving for reasons we don't know got replaced by another woman (~27)  who ended up leaving because she decided IT wasn't really for her...,2017-07-24T02:12:37.633,1538
5863,2894,2,... In my psychology course there were 2-3 males (including me) everyone else was female. I ended up leaving because I found it was too much work on top of the demanding game design course and game design was more important to me. I could be wrong but I think advertising aside a good chunk of it is down to actual interest. (Disclaimer: my childhood also began in the 90s.),2017-07-24T02:18:31.463,1538
5869,2895,0,I think the theory here is that the early part of the graph shows an accelerated take-up 1970-1980 encouraged by the prevailing gender assumptions (these were the pre mini-computer children) and after that the boys started to realise they could do this. Would need to compare male and female degree counts to investigate further.,2017-07-24T09:12:02.683,41
5871,2895,2,Well I don't have exact survey numbers on what people thought about computers and gender in the 70s and 80s so I can't tie specific data points together. But the shift in people thinking of work with computers as a job for women to a career for men happened and the timeframe looks like it would match up so I think it bears considering as an explanation for the direction reversal in proportions of women that didn't seem to happen in other fields.,2017-07-24T09:19:17.637,2157
5883,2894,4,+1 for Occams Razor and for matching my experience (in the business world) - I do work with plenty of women but even those of them that can and do program as part of their daily work do it more matter-of-factly because they can and want to get something *done*. The colleagues who do the more driving stuff (trying out new programming paradigms hardcore debugging of 3rd party modules going the DevOps rouet etc. etc.) are 99% men. Purely based on interest as there is no perceptible discrimination here in my company (there are precious few of the needed profiles anyways...).,2017-07-24T10:32:50.943,652
5885,2903,3,A good start for a course in C. Java not so much.,2017-07-24T11:32:17.063,1293
5886,2903,0,_@Buffy that I can't change. But I also don't quite agree with you. I think both are quite ok for introductory classes.,2017-07-24T11:36:22.510,150
5891,2905,0,with 9th graders? They don't even know mathematical power rules (useful for binary). They don't have algorithmic thinking and the regular curriculum isn't the place to fix that. Maybe a summer workshop...,2017-07-24T12:02:42.907,150
5893,2905,0,Fine if one of the goals is to extend their math knowledge but early problems don't need to be math-y. They would rather be creating games anyway I'd guess. Tradition dies hard though.,2017-07-24T12:13:43.127,1293
5894,2905,0,That's one of the reasons I have doubts about that curriculum which is why I asked for a review. I am simply unsure if the order seems good and whether arrays should be included. I'm also asking about the functions part. It's overall about the curriculum but also specific parts in it...,2017-07-24T12:17:56.760,150
5895,2906,0,and that fits into 1 year? Wow...,2017-07-24T12:19:46.077,150
5896,2905,0,By functions I assume you mean static methods. I'd (much) prefer non-static methods and polymorphism of course but without at least functions students can only write monolithic code. Not even C-like. A disaster for them in my view. FORTRAN. COBOL. ;-),2017-07-24T12:23:50.923,1293

5899,2899,0,The first peak around 1985  that looks like people who got access to home computers (ZX81 Apple II BBC B etc) while normal children where out playing with their friends.   The only fun thing you could do on most computers at that time was learn how to program them.,2017-07-24T13:02:53.497,2171
5900,2906,1,it is a lot but that's the dictated AP curriculum. IMO I would ditch the higher-level OOP of inheritance and dive deeper into the collections and algorithms or work with GUIs in an intro course but our hands are tied.,2017-07-24T13:09:05.413,1743
5901,393,0,I seen this work well with students not being able to give themselves credits and the lowest and highest credit each student got being ignored.,2017-07-24T13:10:37.683,2171
5902,2906,0,but is that for 1 year?,2017-07-24T13:11:47.513,150
5903,2906,0,Yes. Here I am saying that one year is composed of a fall and spring semester.,2017-07-24T13:24:16.643,1743
5905,2906,3,+1 You must absolutely teach data structures. By all means ditch inheritance but keep interfaces. Generics should probably be in there somewhere but in Java/C# they are so intuitive that they just slide in naturally when teaching lists (no need to teach co/contravariance just yet though explicit type constraints are straightforward enough).,2017-07-24T13:32:12.720,1333
5907,2894,1,_@Oleg Was this in the USA? It sounds like a different culture. Certainly not China though,2017-07-24T13:36:35.807,2173
5908,2903,0,First language I learned was Visual Basic and we learned it by dragging stuff onto a form then changing their properties in the IDE then double clicking them (to auto-generate their event handlers) and changing the properties in code. After that we learned variables. It really helped when it came time to learn OOP because we had already worked with the visual classes.,2017-07-24T13:44:36.813,1595
5910,2903,0,_@StephenS So what do you suggest I do with the curriculum? How should I reorder the subjects (or add\remove subjects)?,2017-07-24T13:46:03.233,150
5913,641,0,Well some compilers (references needed) 1) detect that `string` is not modified by te loop  2) make the assumption that it is not modified by another thead 3) thus optimize  using a cache variable for the length.,2017-07-24T14:01:38.857,2103
5914,2894,2,_@axsvl77 This was in Israel. There was a huge immigration from the Soviet Union in the early 90's and there were lots of people who couldn't find jobs adequate to their expertise and they were also dissatisfied with Israeli education so they created a network of evening schools for ex Soviet Union kids (All the teachings were done in Russian they even tried to teach Russian grammar but we weren't interested). Those kind of evening schools were specific to Israel in the early to mid 90's they don't exist anymore. Also if I remember correctly it was 2 times a week for 3-4 hours each time.,2017-07-24T14:02:45.463,2149
5916,2909,1,Awesome :) In my experience using this approach (especially the Analysis step) has helped students start tackling problems that they were initially overwhelmed by.,2017-07-24T14:12:59.067,2045

5919,2894,20,_@nova I very much agree with you; likewise with Chinese women in CS. It cannot be biological. However cultural gender roles are certainly important. I wish I knew enough about the US feminist movement and its impact on child rearing 1966-1984 to comment why in the US males would be more inclined to like CS and why US females did not.,2017-07-24T14:22:41.570,2173

5923,2879,0,Was there computer advertising in the early 1970s when these people were children? At an age when they were forming ideas about their gender roles? This seems doubtful to me.,2017-07-24T14:56:19.937,2173
5925,2879,1,_@axsvl77 The advertising was for personal computers which came about in the 80s... Those who were children **then** were affected (boys promoted and girls rejected). From there the narrative I describe took over.,2017-07-24T14:58:35.353,150
5926,2879,1,_@ItamarG3 Yes true. But the question is about people **graduating** in 1984 not those who were children in the 1980s. Your answer is certainly relevant for those graduating in the 90's.,2017-07-24T15:08:31.813,2173
5927,2894,2,I am not sure that the theory that millions of years of evolution have lead the women to be less interested in CS than men is simple. I think that explaining the under-representation of women in CS with a societal point of view instead of a biological one is much more simple.,2017-07-24T15:10:09.787,2177
5928,2879,1,_@axsvl77 the question asks why the numbers in CS are so different. All other fields don't see such a radical decrease. This drop happens more towards 1990. Also I'll correct myself: PCs started spreading and being advertised around 1977.,2017-07-24T15:21:43.397,150

In China only 20% of programmers are female [source](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-01/13/content_27943492.htm)  and from my personal experience working with a 10 person Chinese development team they were all male.,2017-07-24T15:24:23.660,2149

Beware*) are things that I've found extremely useful but have yet to find in any plugin/IDE. Whether that's my inability to find the functionality or the plugin not having it I don't know but the OP seemed to express interest in more comprehensive functionality.,2017-07-24T16:17:27.253,2186
5941,2874,2,As an old timer I cannot let any mention of syntactic sugar in Java/C++ pass without quoting Alan Perlis: Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon. To see all his wonderful epigrams follow http://www.leptonica.com/cachedpages/perlis-epigrams.html,2017-07-24T15:41:20.857,401
5943,2894,0,_@TomCornebize First you have to define white and differences between white and not white in a meaningful way if you can do that then yes you should start with that assumption falsify it and only then proceed looking for other more complicated explanations.,2017-07-24T16:38:52.890,2149
5944,2895,0,_@ItamarG3 - I might be able to partially answer that: When I graduated with a CS degree in 1989 I discovered most of my new co-workers did not actually have a CS degree. CS degrees were still a pretty new thing and I think there just weren't that many of us around until recently. Reference the blue bar-graphs in Nat's answer.,2017-07-24T16:43:39.853,1139
5945,2902,1,_@Daevin This is a good point. I know that at least the JetBrains IDEs usually provide access to a terminal so you could type those commands there. -- As a sidenote: I think EGit even has the commands you're talking about as a built-in: Stashing should be possible with Team > Stashes > ... resetting using Replace with > .... But I nevertheless get your point ;),2017-07-24T16:47:56.410,793
5946,2912,3,Nice answer. OP notice that a git server is just another remote to `git`. This means for example that you can use remotes also for local backups et cetera.,2017-07-24T16:49:18.977,757

5951,2894,4,_@nova Thank you that was very interesting and informative. A couple quotes from the Qatar article: *computer science is considered a lesser degree here* *part of the attraction of computer science for women is that it can be done from home* and Malaysia: *three primary influences on students going into CS were their personal enthusiasm parental interests and wishes and job prospects* ***the last two were much more important than the first one***. This aligns perfectly with my hypotheses in those countries personal interests are less important. When women can choose most don't choose CS.,2017-07-24T18:11:04.637,2149
5952,2921,11,I second this resource. I think it's miles above in quality compared to any other git tutorial. Other tutorials take a cookbook-like approach and teach git commands as a series of things to be memorized or talk about git model in a fairly abstract and hard-to-grasp way. This tutorial _does_ focus on git's underlying model and does a great job of helping you see what's inherently possible and not possible with git (even if you might not remember the exact commands to do something).,2017-07-24T18:17:41.647,732
5953,2901,0,_@DanielVest??l Nice idea! Why don't you write an answer suggesting GitKraken as client? It's not Open Source so it doesn't fullfill OP's requirements in this point but neither does mine here - I'd love to hear from you ;),2017-07-24T18:22:30.877,793

5957,2902,1,ah gotcha. Most of my experience comes from the Visual Studio plugin for Git Visual Studio's Team Explorer and the GitHub desktop client which are quite limited in their implementation of commands.  I've used JetBrains' and Android Studio's git integration though it was a couple years ago and I found it to be lacking as well. But as you said most of these have the ability to open the command line to your local repo so I guess the point is moot as long as you know the commands :P,2017-07-24T18:41:14.547,2186

5959,2894,2,Thanks for your reply. My concern about your explanation is that it does not explain why so many women graduated in CS in 1984 and the years preceding but not afterwards. If women are much less likely to enjoy programming (which is a fine hypothesis) why didn't they drop out of the CS major after taking freshman programming classes in 1980?,2017-07-24T18:45:55.163,283
5960,2899,1,I agree that people should be free to choose their own majors. My question was not meant to imply that any number was ideal just that the delta seems mysterious.,2017-07-24T18:46:58.793,283
5961,2894,1,_@Oleg Parental pressure and job prospects are issues in the US Europe and Israel as well. It could be that they just point the other way. My parents didn't want me to pursue CS because they felt I'd be around a lot of guys who didn't respect women. Also consider India (~30% female) as [a case study](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/5/186026-decoding-femininity-in-computer-science-in-india/abstract).,2017-07-24T18:56:23.010,2045
5962,2901,4,Does a GUI make git easy to learn or just easier to use?  Most of the developers I've worked with who used a GUI for git still didn't really understand git.  They just knew where to click to make something happen and if anything went wrong they were lost.,2017-07-24T19:06:32.247,224
5963,2901,1,_@WayneConrad Depends on the GUI I think. For GitHub Desktop I'd say it probably just makes it easier to use however it at least helps against forgetting commands. Other answers here provide GUIs that are better for learning I think.,2017-07-24T19:08:57.930,793

5973,2901,4,I'm hesitant to recommend GitHub Desktop to a new user trying to learn Git. Similar to using BlueJ for Java it can be very difficult to transition to a different client after getting used to GitHub Desktop.

5977,2894,0,_@axsvl77 It's worth noting that in China maths is considered to be much more important than in the west and children are pressured into learning it.

5982,2899,5,At the risk of sounding clich?? Health Professions; Social Work; Education; Psychology; all have one element in common: the desire to help/nurture people. I admit I (a male) choose to do psychology at AS level (alongside a BTEC in video game design) but I chose to do it because I wanted to understand people's psychology/behaviour not because I wanted to help people. Ultimately that wanting to solve mysteries is what attracted me to programming instead (and it was a darn sight easier than understanding people). (Plus I kept disagreeing with the established theories of psychology.),2017-07-24T21:12:07.957,1538
5983,2896,0,The original 'computers' were humans who were paid to 'compute' things with mental arithmetic. The most abstract description of a computer is something with inputs processing and outputs which arguably classifies a logic gate as a computer.,2017-07-24T21:15:53.570,1538

5986,2896,0,_@Oleg Personally I wouldn't conflate phones (e.g. Android) with 'computers' (e.g. Ubuntu). One is intended for texting social media and being tracked by Google the other is intended for `sudo apt-get install emacs24 emacs24-el emacs24-common-non-dfsg`. Granted Linux is at the core of Android but we all know that a good 90% of the people who own an Android phone don't even know how to access the terminal let alone what `sudo` is.,2017-07-24T21:19:40.383,1538

5989,2918,0,While I won't argue that git isn't unintuitive at times `cherry-pick branchname` isn't really one of them IMO. This is actually something I discovered neither by accident nor search but by reasoning: ?€?so I want to CP the last commit from branch `B`. Hm I could parse out the commit ID wait how do you do that again? Oh never mind I'll just `git log B` and copy&paste that commit ID... but wait what if I simply write `git cherry-pick B` in one command??€?,2017-07-24T21:24:23.783,1157

5995,2896,0,_@Pharap I was thinking of voip. But yes mobile phones are computer as well and your point is exactly right. A mobile phone is not thought of as a computer.

6000,2903,1,We teach a camp for iOS development in the summers which is thankfully more graphical but my suggestions would be: - keep it visual is possible interactivity builds interest - dispel the programming magic as much as possible if you have a debugger show them how to step through line by line and watch variables - avoid duplication of concepts where possible (unless it is a real programming class). You have if/else you don't need switches. Take a second day on if/else it will pay off more. - nested loops are trivial unless you are also covering variable scope,2017-07-24T22:04:14.423,2205
6003,2904,3,+1 for getting comments in there early. People need to know that code is not just for the compiler/interpreter; it's also for all of the other programmers who will need to maintain the code.  This includes future-you who will wonder what idiot wrote this crap before seeing your own initials in the comments and realizing that now-you was in fact an idiot by future-you's standards.

6004,989,0,_@corsiKa does that mean we should pander to that lowest common denominator in our teaching and not even *attempt* to relay any deep understanding?  Interesting view.  Doesn't seem to belong on CS **Educators** SE though.  It reminds me of the fantasy novel *The Year of the Griffin* by Diana Wynne Jones which examines the aftereffects of such an approach to teaching magic.

6022,2902,1,_@Daevin Just so you know IntelliJ IDEs support `stash [pop]` `reset HEAD~[n]` (via selecting it in the log) and even interactive rebase as part of their in-IDE Git integration.

6023,2798,0,Depending on the programming language is 100% correct. Some languages make a distinction between functions and procedures to varying degrees others do not. @richard Using the mathematical concept of a function is misguided. It may or may not apply to the situation and can be harmful to student comprehension. Some languages even allow a given subroutine to be called with and without a return value in the same program. The importance of making a distinction between them in any course is dictated _only_ by the language used. The language handles the rest will determine the order of the topics.,2017-07-25T08:35:49.633,104

6025,2793,0,_@GypsySpellweaver as well as Von-Neumann/Harvard Architecture (where Harvard is just a type of Von Neumann) there are many others. The ALU is a functional component however it is wrapped in mutation `add r0 r1 ???r3`. There are stack based where there is no data addresses all data is on a stack `add` this takes to values from stack adds them and puts result onto stack. (This is a pure functional language implemented in hardware). I know there is a forth cpu out there.

6027,2793,0,_@GypsySpellweaver Single instruction machines have no program counter so no instruction addresses and possibly no data addresses. One of my peers an university made a massively parallel single instruction computer. It used a counter as data input (Von Neumann uses a counted for Program counter input). On each clock tick it would test the input. If test succeeded then the input data was captured into a small ram. Apart from this result capture the rest was functional. It ran at only 0.1Mz because of complex instruction. It ran over night & did what fastest supercomputer would take 20 years.,2017-07-25T09:29:31.133,204

6033,2902,0,_@NathanCooper It's a matter of taste. I find it quite clean simple and easy to use while keeping the CLI and GitExtensions for the things you really shouldn't be doing as part of normal work. I certainly prefer right clicking a commit in history to do my hard resets rather than blindly deleting the last ten commits (or was it nine? Dammit...). The only thing that is a strong part of the TFS-but-on-Git IMO is that it's optimised for a single central Git repository - which scarcely seems like a bad choice for a typical corporate customer.

6050,2902,0,_@CAD97 good to know! I haven't used IntelliJ IDEs too much lately just in my free time playing around since I work at a Microsoft-shop. So I haven't needed to delve into the IDE's git capabilities too much. I'll keep that in mind though. Cheers!,2017-07-25T13:43:10.070,2186
6051,2902,0,_@NathanCooper I actually do like the sync capability it's just a single command for fetch-pull-push. Especially since I've had to 'teach' git to some coworkers and so many can't be bothered to to multiple commands the Commit and Sync button is a life(repo)-saver lol.,2017-07-25T13:49:43.667,2186
6052,2940,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a good answer. I hope we'll be seeing more answers and questions from you.,2017-07-25T14:06:41.953,150
6053,2918,2,When I was first learning it seemed like everything was DAG-this and DAG-that and I thought Yes I get it it's using a directed acyclic graph for storage; now TELL ME HOW TO USE GIT.. The some day it clicked and I thought: Oh it's a directed acyclic graph! Everything is so simple now.,2017-07-25T14:17:47.207,2245
6054,2919,0,Upvoted. Even if you generally prefer command-line once you know what you are doing (as all True Developers should) the GUI is great for learning the capabilities and expected workflow of the system. **This is precisely how I learned** with the exception that instead of #2 I used it on a small project of my own to get my feet under me. That also meant I wasn't screwing up anybody else when I made the first few inevitable noob mistakes. Of course using someone else's IDE (as suggested in another answer) is not as helpful because those weren't designed around Git like Git GUI was.,2017-07-25T14:34:37.090,1139
6055,2918,0,...which is again why you should start with Git GUI which gives you a nice graphical picture of the DAG.,2017-07-25T14:38:14.803,1139
6056,2934,0,What kind of feedback do you think would be appropriate to give? I could certainly give feedback on things like the quality of their code but it's not clear to me how I can effectively give feedback on a mindset or way of thought.,2017-07-25T15:30:00.730,732
6057,2934,0,_@Michael0x2a I'll edit my answer shall I? (:D),2017-07-25T15:30:56.320,150
6059,2896,0,This is interesting but does not answering the question I asked.,2017-07-25T15:35:43.220,283
6060,2911,0,I wouldn't expect a generational difference to be sharp but gradual.,2017-07-25T15:36:17.547,283
6063,2941,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. This is a very interesting answer!,2017-07-25T16:34:04.923,150
6064,2934,0,_@Michael0x2a better?,2017-07-25T16:49:33.837,150
6065,2879,0,I find this answer very interesting though a bit sad. This would mean that back then people *already* had the wrong impression that CS is about computers. Probably the bad wording in the English term computer science doesn't really help either. Although the same phenomenon happens for instance in my country (Italy) where the word is not a direct translation of computer science.,2017-07-25T17:01:29.713,963
6066,2879,0,you're right but It's not too late. As long as people are educated to destroy that unfair narrative and build a new one where prejudice and the thought that women don't  belong in CS are nowhere to be seen. Education is the key IMO,2017-07-25T17:05:45.633,150
6067,2941,1,Interesting point but do you have data that such changes were widespread just after the class of 1984 entered college?,2017-07-25T17:18:42.073,283
6069,2916,0,It caught me unawares as well. It took me well into my 3rd year of teaching CS and scratching my head at the code students submitted on written exams before a conversation with a kid finally made the lightbulb go on for me.,2017-07-25T17:50:10.183,27
6076,305,0,I don't get why you're adding 4 to go from *a* to *c* when they should be *two* addresses apart and yet you say it's *four* bytes per int.  Where is *b* then?  (Nevertheless +1 for a great illustration.),2017-07-25T20:12:35.490,1103
6077,2817,0,the  `var = expr` notation for assignment was used before Basic. It was explained in the preliminary report of Fortran << [J.W. Backus H. Herrick and I. Ziller.] Preliminary Report : Specifications for the IBM Mathematical FORmula TRANSlating System FORTRAN. Programming Research Group Applied Science Division International Business Machines Corporation November 10 1954 29 pages. >> http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102679231.05.01.acc.pdf,2017-07-25T20:42:13.023,2103
6078,305,0,_@Wildcard I tried to clarify the text.  IIRC on my compiler (I tested my code when I wrote this) ints were 2 byes.,2017-07-25T20:44:48.807,27
6079,2817,0,Agreed. Basic implemented the LET operator to alleviate the confusion generated by the overloaded use of the = operator.,2017-07-25T20:51:22.267,1537
6081,305,0,Got it thanks.  It wasn't the answer text that caused the confusion; it was your earlier comment: *Mine used a 4-byte integer which is also permitted.*  I understand now that was just a slip.  Thanks for clarifying!  :),2017-07-25T20:57:04.773,1103
6085,2935,0,_@nocomprende I agree.  I'd like to see your answer to this.  :)  And in general I'd like to see more professionals who really *do* try to understand the entire system.  It's not necessary to be paralyzed until you do but when *no one* even tries the result is [nasty complexity](http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/how-to-handle-code-complexity/).,2017-07-25T22:19:34.790,1103
6089,2935,0,_@nocomprende yep.  There are many great articles on there; I had a co-worker completely change his mind about a code fix he had proposed after he read [Make It Never Come Back.](http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/make-it-never-come-back/),2017-07-25T23:34:04.400,1103
6091,2940,0,I worked with much more than 20 women (number of women in this research) and never saw them face any kind of discrimination nobody treated them differently they had no problems participating in meetings and many were team leads. Nevertheless it is peer reviewed and published in a real journal so it's certainly valid to reference it in an answer. It's not even needed saying because it became more like engineering is enough. This is the first answer that makes sense to me(even the lines converge) if you can also show it actually happened in the 80's it will answer the question.,2017-07-26T01:33:39.780,2149
6092,2946,1,I love this question and I am very curious about what others suggest as well.,2017-07-26T03:23:14.340,27
6093,2947,0,_Lions and Tigers and Bears! Oh my!_ but please let's not talk about the elephant! Say what's that over there? Is that Kelly Pickler? No? Oh sorry about that. Now where were we. Oh yea that ostrich over there. It seems to have a good idea. Now can any one tell me how a while loop is made?,2017-07-26T04:06:10.007,104
6099,2943,1,No the question is specifically about women. Adding an answer to pose another question is not the way SE works. You can read the [answer] page to get more tips. Other than that Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-26T08:21:11.493,150
6101,2953,0,What language is your example in?,2017-07-26T09:17:31.960,204
6102,2953,0,_@richard java... but that's not what the question is about.,2017-07-26T09:18:16.427,150
6103,2955,0,Recursion in OOP languages is a bit harder to recognize for a compiler. What looks like recursion may not be since the receiving object may be different from the sending object and so may have a different implementation of the method. Final methods can be recognized of course. The problem is made harder by the fact that when a class is compiled it doesn't know which subclasses will exist in the future nor the precise class of the invoking object as it can be from a subclass.,2017-07-26T10:58:19.427,1293
6104,2953,0,I don't know how to react to this. It seems like obfuscated code to me. There is no indication of the intent of the method so I can _only_ try to understand it one way - the most detailed possible non-abstract way. Is the code given in the test this complex? Give an example from a previous iteration of the test. If you replace the method name with blah and it is no harder IMO. Are you trying to teach students to infer intent from code or trying to teach students to code to implement intent.,2017-07-26T11:03:51.880,1293
6105,2953,0,_@Buffy I'm sorry I don't quite understand the difficulty. The example is just one for them to trace.,2017-07-26T11:24:04.230,150
6108,2953,0,Hmmm. Recursion within a loop with no hint about intent other than the method name. I'd rather go to the dentist. Not even a specific invocation on which to hang my hat.,2017-07-26T11:55:44.977,1293
6109,2953,0,_@Buffy that's the point. The students supposedly trace the execution of the function and from that they understand what it does.,2017-07-26T12:07:12.230,150
6110,2939,0,I just watched the video. I realised that it is not just me. The internals are easy the interface is not. I also learnt that git now gives useful help messages (it would be better if it was easier to use but this is a start). I will probably stick with mercurial for now (though mercurial does not handle renames efficiently).,2017-07-26T12:21:50.053,204
6111,2953,0,Hmmm. Why not [ackermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function)(3 2)?,2017-07-26T12:21:57.880,1293
6113,2955,0,_@Buffy that is an implementation detail of the language/compiler. C++ Eiffel and some others can do tail-call optimisation.,2017-07-26T12:24:11.527,204
6114,2953,0,_@Buffy better? The question isn't about that specific example but rather about the effectiveness of testing recursion knowledge like this.,2017-07-26T12:27:04.280,150
6115,2955,0,I'm pretty sure that it is possible only in certain cases. In the face of polymorphism the compiler doesn't know the code that will be executed and so can't optimize it. Look at what happens in a recursive call from a subclass of the class that defined the method initially. The compiler can't roll the tail recursion into a loop if it the body of the loop doesn't even yet exist. That said some languages try harder to look for the relevant cases and some require more of the program to be available at compile time. But dynamic linking makes it a hard problem.,2017-07-26T12:27:07.770,1293
6117,2955,0,`As when we design we need to abstract`. They are not designing. Sure they might be designing next year but now they just learnt the subject and they need to be tested (ministry decision...),2017-07-26T12:37:03.003,150
6118,2955,0,_@Buffy Eiffel optimises out polymorphic calls if not need. C++ allows you to choose (but not at the correct part of the design yuck). However it does not seem as hard as it may seem: If I am called polymorphicly then call my self then I am referring to my self not a different version of my self (the type of `this` can not change. Once I am called the type of this is determined therefore all calls to ones own methods could be done staticly ).,2017-07-26T12:37:45.503,204
6119,2897,3,It's always nice when someone wakes up and decides to delete your comments. Thanks!!,2017-07-26T12:40:01.303,2249
6120,2955,0,_@ItamarG3 If we are not setting them up to design then what are we doing? (If we just test some abstract thing for no reason then we have people that know something well but have no use for it.),2017-07-26T12:40:20.460,204
6121,2955,1,Probably better discussed in the classroom. However if this is in a subclass and the (superclass) code containing the this ref is compiled before the subclass is written the effect of the call can't be determined at compile time. That is to say this is not an object whose most specific class is the class being compiled. But as you say some languages look harder for the possible cases. That is what I said I think. I haven't looked at the internals of Eiffel. Does it require enough source to build a linkable image? Java does not.,2017-07-26T12:41:23.000,1293
6122,2943,2,No this is actually great insight. Just dawned on me so I went back to this question just to see the answer already here. The question specifically refers to the **proportion** so men **are** part of that equation. Example: if CS was unpopular universally but then men become more interested but women remained uninterested then we could see the proportion of women drop dramatically even though the change was caused by men('s changed interest) and not caused by women (or anything different they did). Such a change **would** affect the proportion. +1 for 2nd and 4th paragraphs.,2017-07-26T13:39:34.410,1676
6123,2951,1,I usually think about those as tradeoffs rather than mistakes.  *This language values ____ and that implies certain tradeoffs such as this one.*,2017-07-26T13:54:52.937,27
6124,2895,0,I think you do an important job of setting up the context of how computer science was viewed in the 80s. I would not even be surprised if at that time people wanting to do what we now consider to be computer science would rather choose to start a degree in electronics.,2017-07-26T14:00:59.743,2279
6125,2939,0,_@richard yeah the git interface can be difficult from time to time but it's worth learning. Having used mercurial for the past few years and having spent the last year or so getting deeply familiar with git I'm finally beginning to understand all the hubub. Mercurial is a fine tool and I still use it it gives almost all the benefits of using git while being a simpler model to understand and there's enough plugins I bet it can replicate 98% of the git feature set. But once I got the git model it started to feel much more natural as a developer and I've started moving to git exclusively,2017-07-26T14:46:42.567,2238
6126,2954,0,Isn't this just deferring the problem though? I'd argue that *all* programming languages have quirks of some kind. You can avoid having to teach as many quirk by starting with a better-designed language true but it doesn't seem like you can avoid the problem entirely. (For example here's one example of an Eiffel quirk: methods are covariant in their argument types rather then being contravariant),2017-07-26T16:02:21.103,732
6127,2953,0,Why not have them identify the base case(s) and/or explain why a function will (or won't) always reach the base case? Tracing the stack only shows they understand function calls. Understanding recursion requires understanding that every function call always works towards some base case so test them on that instead.,2017-07-26T16:29:55.530,2285
6128,2953,0,_@KyleGullion the question isn't about teaching recursion. It's about whether the described test method (on an exam) would actually be able to test the students' knowledge about recursion.,2017-07-26T16:45:30.763,150
6130,2946,0,The great Josh Bloch teaches serious points about Java in an entertaining way with his Java Puzzlers book and talks.  http://www.javapuzzlers.com/,2017-07-26T17:16:10.713,283

6142,2926,0,Good point. That may be part of the reason however not very simple to prove and the peak at 1984 is still rather special somehow.,2017-07-26T21:09:41.300,2062
6145,2894,2,This answer even if (trivially) correct is useless. The poster wanted to know why things got this way. This answer merely takes one obvious baby step down the road without fundamentally answering the why question. This is like answering Why are there more home runs this year? with Because batters are hitting the ball better.,2017-07-26T21:39:35.497,1139
6146,2940,1,_@Oleg - I suspect if we were to ask them rather than take the word of a guy who was merely female adjacent at the time we might get a different story. (Or not. We don't know. That's why I really am sick of discussions amongst men about this subject. We literally don't know what we are talking about).,2017-07-26T21:43:18.330,1139
6148,2941,0,I graduated with a CS BE in 1989. At the time pretty much all CS degrees were given out of either the Math department or the Engineering and that did somewhat stilt what was taught. However if your degree was **accredited** then there was a base standardized curriculum that had to be taken. If your degree wasn't accredited of course all bets are off but that's still true today.,2017-07-26T21:50:23.183,1139
6150,2940,0,_@T.E.D. That's a fair point but I also think we should stop treating some crap based on 40 diaries as science (many people already don't). You also can't base your research only on peoples feelings imagine a research about sexual harassment based on [Zarna Joshi's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hml2d6aY5v4) diary. Hugh: *My name is Hugh Mungus* Zarna: *This man just sexually harassed me!!!*,2017-07-26T22:48:58.630,2149
6168,2897,1,_@gbr You could've said that a little more nicely I have feelings too :) But if you wanted to reach me it would have been much easier to simply raise a mod atten flag.

6236,2973,1,Regarding your first paragraph I wouldn't be asking for them to _invent_ it per se. Rather I'd teach it (as I do) with some demos of each of the three sorting algorithms so students see the process in action. I'd also give them the pseudocode logic. This sounds much like what you have them do in your second paragraph. My question though is whether I should then have them write bubble sort based on what they've just seen or just give them the code and have them start applying and analyzing it.,2017-07-27T20:45:53.760,76

6267,2972,0,_@nocomprende I dunno what the world was like back then but I could imagine it being harder to obtain qualified CS instructors and equipment to deal with a sudden surge like the plots show; universities tend to be slow-moving environments.  Hopefully it'd be a lot easier today since a lot of factors have changed.,2017-07-28T12:56:30.633,39
6269,2944,0,I think that is interesting but it is harder to maintain the levels of abstraction and easier to build the big ball 'o mud. So it takes discipline if is is really the levels of abstraction that you want to teach.

Yet this one arguably *does* address the question provides an answer roughly equivalent to the one in the second-highest rated answer and attempts to provide a **first hand perspective** to what is going on. Yet **this** is the answer that gets voted down into oblivion. If you want to see where the problem comes from what happened to this post illustrates it perfectly.,2017-07-28T18:42:39.293,1139
6278,2984,1,welcome to [cseducators.se]! A very nice question. I advise you use the [tag:resource-request] tag.,2017-07-29T09:31:01.360,150
6279,2984,7,Those answering are encouraged to do more than name a book. Say why you believe the book is a good fit and describe it to some extent. One book per answer is likely better than a single long list.,2017-07-29T12:50:06.720,1293
6281,2982,1,Possibly helpful to users thinking of making suggestions or to yourself to generate ideas; *what specific concept should the lab demonstrate or expose?* information theory is pretty big for a lab or three.,2017-07-29T15:39:24.097,104
6282,2985,1,Smile like you mean it and *fake* it until you *make* it.,2017-07-29T15:43:40.967,104
6283,2973,0,Regarding the first sentence if it's such an impossible task how come it's been done so many times by so many people before many times as coursework?,2017-07-29T15:47:39.970,104
6284,2973,0,_@GypsySpellweaver ?€?I want you to discover and implement insertion sort. It is a sorting algorithm. I can not tell you any more about it as you must do it from scratch. If you hand in a solution for merge/selection/quick/bubble/any-other sort then you will fail the unit.?€? (It probably depends on what you mean by scratch),2017-07-29T16:29:35.643,204

6287,2992,0,Yes I've done that and it works. Thanks.,2017-07-29T17:59:03.693,1293
6288,2991,0,not yet is an interesting concept. I normally allow do-overs as a regular part of grading. Similar but not quite the same.,2017-07-29T18:00:30.527,1293
6289,2915,0,Thanks for joining CS Educators. It's good to see you here.,2017-07-29T19:11:04.380,283
6290,2982,0,_@GypsySpellweaver Any of the concepts listed above. Should those each be separate questions? It felt like the topics would get so miniscule as to become useless for others.,2017-07-29T19:46:33.283,27
6291,2985,2,What's the difference between authenticity bias and [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) (besides the fact that only the latter has a Wikipedia article)?,2017-07-29T20:57:43.847,1523
6292,2985,0,_@jwodder My interpretation of the differences: 1. Naturalness bias (what the article actually discusses) refers to the belief that one's success depends primarily on innate ability. This belief may or may not be part of imposter syndrome. 2. Imposter syndrome is more common at higher levels when one has nominally achieved some success (admission to a graduate program a prestigious job) while Buffy is describing an earlier stage in students' lives.,2017-07-29T21:04:35.823,283
6293,2984,0,I already gave one answer (SICP) but if I could give a second I might suggest *Computers and Intractability*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability,2017-07-29T21:29:59.977,283
6294,838,0,If you use the command-line because to are forced to because the can not use the GUI then you do not know the value of the command line. This is only one of the smaller advantages.,2017-07-29T21:47:30.877,204
6295,866,0,I love the command-line. I love ssh. I love to type in a command that opens a window on the local machine but is running on the remote.,2017-07-29T21:50:21.173,204
6296,2984,1,_@EllenSpertus As I understand it in situations like this the limit is one resource per answer with appropriate supporting text to clarify why it's recommended and how it fits the question. I don't recall anything limiting it to one answer per user however. Even on non-list questions a second answer is acceptable as long as it is distinct from the first one as they must be by definition in this case. Write up the answer supporting _Computers and Intractability_.,2017-07-30T01:12:49.553,104
6300,3002,0,That second paragraph sounds especially useful. But that doesn't answer whether I should really devote a lesson for teaching how and why one should write a css stylesheet instead of inline html `style` attributes.,2017-07-30T10:04:54.863,150
6301,3002,0,Added a partial answer to If and why to devote a lesson to it.,2017-07-30T11:01:31.140,204
6307,3002,1,I agree that un-teaching is an especially wasteful use of everyone's time. It is best to catch misconceptions before bad habits are built and reinforced.,2017-07-30T13:03:45.610,1293
6309,2869,0,Yes thanks fantastic for middle school! Also reminds me of earthquakes. I've noted anecdotally that kids with extreme interest in weather and earthquakes are disproportionately boys. A book about CS at CMU (Kicking Butt in CS) claims that CMU's success in getting gender balance was orthogonqal to such gender difference observations but it makes me wonder what the result would be of greater engagement with weather measurements for K-2 girls.,2017-07-30T15:18:27.463,765
6310,2991,0,You could save a lot of time by just issuing everyone with a pass certificate *before* they start the course. As you might guess I have no sympathy whatever with this happy-clappy approach to education. As preparation for adult life it's *totally* inappropriate IMO. If Socrates was killed for corrupting youth there's a whole generation of happy-clappy teachers who should face the same fate!,2017-07-30T17:31:42.803,1352
6311,3017,0,HI thehayro! Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-07-30T17:33:02.947,58
6312,866,0,I have had several 6th grade Python students who have been drawn to the command-line because of the coolness factor.,2017-07-30T17:33:24.540,2323
6313,2991,0,_@alephzero I see that you have not watched the video or read her papers. In the video she say that we need to stop praising pupils the have a whole generation of people that can not do a days work with out being praised. As for your first point her approach is about teaching not measuring. This give them a certificate at the start is because you thing that school is for measuring people so that employers know who to hire. Where as she is talking about how best to create improvement in people.,2017-07-30T20:05:28.803,204
6315,3002,0,Google says you should include above the fold css in the html file,2017-07-30T21:29:33.010,2247
6316,3002,1,_@tim this is just a load **optimisation**. Conceptuality it should still remain separate. However Google is saying put it in the same file. They are not saying that you should style each bit separately. They are saying take what could be in a css file and add it to the <style> section of the html.,2017-07-30T21:38:03.077,204
6317,3002,0,_@richard yes hence my careful wording there!,2017-07-30T21:44:21.820,2247
6319,2998,4,The core problem here is that you're assuming that styling should not be done directly in HTML and that using CSS is better. Neither of those things is true.,2017-07-30T21:48:00.157,2325
6320,3017,1,Sure. That is up to the requirements where the webpage should be displayed (mobile/desktop). But the question as far as I understood it  was how to explain why and how there is a need for a separation of HTML and CSS.,2017-07-30T21:55:30.143,2324
6321,2984,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I had not realized I could give multiple answers. I'll do so.,2017-07-30T22:53:59.547,283
6322,3022,3,It would be good if you could say a bit more about your expectations for the course and the backgrounds students would have both in math and computing. Are you looking for just an overview of the field or for the students to  have some level of technical or operational knowledge at the end?,2017-07-30T23:21:56.807,1293
6324,3022,1,I've downvoted this question because it sounds too broad for a single answer to cover. You could write a book on teaching cybersecurity. You might be able to narrow this question by elaborating on what you mean by real computer science.,2017-07-30T23:35:13.443,58
6326,1361,0,_@Buffy well...see I think it depends on what you are teaching. If it's say 'program this' then yeah practice is more important. And like you say with a language practice is more important. But in math for example you can't expect a student to derive all of math for themselves - you have to teach the formulas and *then* let them practice.,2017-07-30T23:37:36.427,919
6327,1361,0,you would be especially interested in the teaching methods of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lee_Moore. While he was not an exemplary human being in all respects his teaching methods were unique. In fact his students many of whom rose to the very height of the profession did indeed derive everything for themselves.,2017-07-30T23:44:49.480,1293
6328,1361,0,_@Buffy an interesting method that I'd kind of enjoy - in fact it sounds a lot like critical reading as a self-teaching student where you try to pick holes in and prove every theorem you come across. However I'm not sure that's a great method for a large(r) class of widely ranging abilities especially not a graduate/higher level class of more motivated students.,2017-07-30T23:54:39.277,919
6329,3021,1,Hi Puppy welcome to [cseducators.se]! If you'd like to meet another puppy you can say hi to [Buffy](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/users/1293/buffy) who's a bulldog in [chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom). This is an interesting answer thanks for sharing your perspective here!,2017-07-31T00:29:57.157,58
6330,2876,0,My cousin got her CS degree in '79. I got mine 6 years later in '85. My family got an Apple II in '77 while my cousin was in college. I was in high school and I thought the Apple II was the coolest thing in the world. I was surprised that my cousin wasn't really interested in the Apple because at that time it couldn't do much that would apply to her school work or her professional future. In other words our interest in CS was of a different sort. She seemed to be more interested in the profession but I was interested in the gadgets.,2017-07-31T00:37:34.737,2323
6331,2876,1,Hey @GregGraham! Thanks for the comment. I hope we hear more from you around the site. Being active on here has really been the best PD I've ever had.,2017-07-31T00:39:33.820,27
6332,3002,0,What I do with my crummy little framework plugin I run over WordPress: provide a little API for myself to either dump CSS into a <style> tag while outputting HTML or enqueue it as a separate file as the page requires. That's where the reality of web optimization comes in. But of course the concept of style must be kept separate from the content in either case.,2017-07-31T02:00:03.610,927
6333,3004,1,The comparison with functions is good. I presume the sin in question is directly supplying style attributes in source HTML. If so it could be compared to taking the body of a method and just sticking that where you were going to call the method. Counterproductive in the extreme.,2017-07-31T02:02:33.740,927
6334,25,0,_@adamblan Could you give any more details about this assignment?,2017-07-31T02:53:54.230,27
6335,2607,0,Hey @SeanHoulihane.  You often have very keen insights. I miss seeing you around the site!,2017-07-31T02:57:41.403,27
6337,3026,1,Wow. Welcome to [cseducators.se]. This is really something I had not considered. I'd love it if you could add some examples or description that show that. (I **can** write them myself but I'm more interested in seeing what you can think of). This really is an interesting answer :),2017-07-31T08:11:49.980,150
6338,3026,1,Unrelated: why don't you take our [tour]? I'm sure you'd find it interesting.,2017-07-31T08:12:47.037,150
6339,2998,0,_@Puppy well part of the question is whether I should teach it separatly. If I don't  then they won't use stylesheets. But do you think any website anywhere actually hardcodes all it's css in html? **Every** `div` has a mountain of code in its `style` attribute?,2017-07-31T08:17:40.517,150
6340,3026,0,I got it slightly wrong its external style sheet first then document styles and then on the element my brain is never 100% on a monday morning. :),2017-07-31T08:29:43.540,2332
6341,3026,0,forgive and forget ;). You can edit your answer. There's an `edit` button\link directly under your answer. While you're at it would you like to add some example to demonstrate what your answer is addressing? It'd really make it into a much better answer :D,2017-07-31T08:30:19.917,150
6342,3026,0,Unfortunately i do not have time right now. I just wanted to mention inheritance of css as it is important aspect of css.,2017-07-31T08:49:46.570,2332
6343,3026,0,Allright if you have the time then I do recommend reading the [tour].,2017-07-31T08:50:37.963,150

6345,3030,0,you raise some very interesting points. Thanks! and welcome to [cseducators.se],2017-07-31T10:06:34.220,150
6346,63,1,I didn't do a CS degree but I did learn mutli threading at my first year of studying after high school however it was because I had finished the past exercices already (i was quite above the level of our classe because I already practiced programmation before with PHP/web). I learned fork() and process intercommunication (pipe socket semaphorefile ...) right before.,2017-07-31T11:00:13.620,1375
6347,2607,0,What's the acronym SW?,2017-07-31T11:48:06.513,27
6348,2607,0,Software... Which is what most people talk about when the think of computer science.,2017-07-31T11:49:39.650,41
6351,3022,1,I'm really looking for what others think is real computer science and Cybersecurity. It was deliberately written broadly because I didn't want narrow answers.,2017-07-31T13:22:08.580,541
6352,3002,1,Instead of giving the students a variety of style sheets that affect their code I would try the opposite approach.  After teaching them inline styles in HTML give them a page that relies on a CSS document for its style and ask them to make their own stylesheet for it (using the same techniques they learned from using inline HTML - just a matter of labeling the styles and putting them together in one place).  Then everyone in class can compare their style sheets on a common test subject (the one you provided) and see the possibilities.,2017-07-31T13:31:28.503,1089
6354,2998,3,This site shows the power of keeping css separate. http://www.csszengarden.com - Same structure different css stylesheet.,2017-07-31T14:09:24.923,2343
6355,2998,0,_@DavidSpence nice. I'll definitely use that,2017-07-31T14:10:19.910,150
6356,3002,0,_@Darren that's an interesting suggestion.,2017-07-31T14:11:04.310,150
6359,2991,1,_@nocomprende That seem fair we don't want bias. However if we have this ?€?fixed mind set?€? then we do not grow and we get what we expect. But if we have ?€?growth mind set?€? then we learn and are often surprised at what we and our students can do.,2017-07-31T15:49:34.493,204
6361,3002,0,_@Darren I agree though not sure about doing it the wrong way first. Could you put this into an answer with some more detail.,2017-07-31T15:51:16.840,204
6365,3002,0,_@richard I'm not sure what you mean by the wrong way first.  I don't see there being any right or wrong ways just different levels of organization depending on what's needed.  For a one off style on a single element I don't see anything wrong with putting the style in the tag itself if there isn't already a stylesheet assigned that should cover it.  In any case I'm not making that an answer because I don't have an answer for your original question.  It was just a suggestion based on my own experience with HTML and CSS over the years.,2017-07-31T16:07:15.293,1089
6366,2998,0,If you are teaching them about [specificity](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/) as it applies to styling html this is a good place to mention why you may or may not want to use inline styles.  And no I am not making this an answer someone else may integrate this into theirs if they want.,2017-07-31T16:14:22.123,1387
6368,3038,2,Do you mean in logic computations specifically or as an operation in programming? Do you mean also short circuit evaluation?,2017-07-31T16:19:53.443,1293
6370,3038,1,Well exclusive or kind of matches people's intuition of what or means inclusive or is slightly more counterintuitive.,2017-07-31T16:53:17.423,1299
6371,3033,0,As this is a more casual methodology I'm leaving it as a comment: Talk to your students about usage of Facebook etc. and ask them how they would cope and what the consequences would be if they no longer had access to the internet but everyone else still did. (This of course assumes most/all of them use Facebook regularly. I don't but I do use other sites like the Stack Exchange network often.),2017-07-31T17:27:25.830,654
6372,3038,0,some of the answer here may be of help https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/2750/active-learning-for-boolean-algebra/,2017-07-31T17:43:31.140,204
6373,2998,0,_@ItamarG3 Sure why not? You can just call a function that makes a div with the code in and then just do that three times.,2017-07-31T18:29:53.890,2325

6375,2998,0,_@Puppy and how exactly would I syle a div *without some form of CSS?*,2017-07-31T19:35:31.283,150
6378,3038,1,For the What's the point kind of questions I would point out how in English as it is commonly practiced context can change the meaning of the conjunctions. AND can sometimes mean OR. For example: You have two choices: You can go to the party and you can stay home. Everyone hearing it would understand you are listing exclusive options. In this case AND means XOR.,2017-07-31T21:27:21.567,2348
6379,3038,1,OR and AND are ambiguous in English: You can hang your sign here if it's blue or if it's purple.  You can hang your sign here if it's blue and if it's purple. They mean the same thing. The point of rigorously defining the binary (and logical) operators is so they mean one thing and only one thing to make sure you're telling the computer exactly what you want it to do.,2017-07-31T21:30:16.377,2348
6380,3043,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! A very interesting point. But I don't quite see how this answers the question. Could you please edit your answer to add an example for illustrating the difference between OR and XOR?,2017-07-31T21:50:18.413,150
6381,3043,0,It is interesting that I have told my fellow programmers to not do `if condition == true` because we don't say ?€?would you like fries with that is true?€? but here I see this in natural language. As I am from only one part of the English speaking world and the way we speak can change in less than 100 miles. I would like to ask. Do people add ?€?Is true?€? to the end of questions where you are from? ?€? thanks,2017-07-31T21:51:22.057,204
6382,3021,2,While I do not agree with everything you say. I do see your point. Especially the last line (I think you should expand on this). Show us how you think it should be done.  Even if we don't 100% agree we could learn something.,2017-07-31T23:11:51.347,204
6384,3043,0,This really is an interesting point but while I agree that I can't think of any English construction comparable to $A\oplus (B \oplus C)$ why is $A \oplus B$ not the same has he is in Paris or London?,2017-08-01T00:07:30.767,27
6385,3038,1,A 3-way (4-way multiway) light switch can model a xor operation. When both switches are down the light is out when one switch is up the light is on and when both switches are up the light is back off. In multiway configurations the system behaves as the generic definition of the xor function: if the number of switches that are up is odd then the light is on else the light is off. This is all assuming that no switch has been installed upside down of course.,2017-08-01T03:30:37.827,2352
6387,2876,0,I will try to get involved. I just found out about the site and it looks like it will be very helpful.,2017-08-01T13:17:17.463,2323
6388,3046,0,I'm pretty sure that's inclusive or because both would be a fine answer. Would you like a white pie or pie with sauce would be exclusive.,2017-08-01T13:31:57.823,27
6393,3022,1,As nobody really agrees what cyber security is I think you will not get simple answers that will fulfil your requirement.,2017-08-01T14:21:01.403,2357

6413,3052,2,_@ItamarG3 virtual reality is an obvious one. Anything that is looking at usability is another. Signal processing/programming of medical devices is a third. I can go on if needed.,2017-08-01T15:56:26.723,276
6414,3052,0,please do go on. It is needed. but try to do it in the question body. That'll make the question clearer.,2017-08-01T15:57:19.367,150
6415,3052,1,Can you say a bit more about context? Some places permit this at the graduate level but with strong (we hope) safeguards.  It is also a fact that much of the existing research has proven not to be reproducible giving some a false picture of what the truth is. In the US post-secondary institutions have Institutional Review Boards (IRB) to reduce some of the problems.,2017-08-01T15:57:36.383,1293
6416,3052,0,I think you're going to have to expand on what you mean specifically by subjects... but this is definitely better than before! :),2017-08-01T16:07:55.917,150

6418,3033,1,_@richard The Story of Electronics video fiercely advocates halving production of toxics from electronics by 50% every 18 months Green Moore's Law. It points out inequity in toxics production from mining and disposal of electronics a.k.a. advocacy for environmental justice.

6428,2998,0,_@Puppy you're right but that's doesn't mean that saying styling shouldn't be done directly in HTML is not true. Give me one profesional website that has all its styling inline.,2017-08-01T17:47:26.733,150

6464,3067,1,I have never ran a virus scanner on my PC. I just follow the other thinks in your bullet list. My dad just does Secure architecture as he is a complete novice. I phoned me the other day to tell me that his computer was infected with a virus. I asked him how he knew. He told me that the virus scanner told him (interesting as there is not one installed). I tracked the problem down in his web-browser history. He said that is it but I can get the ?€?cleaner?€? to work he had downloaded it but because he did not know how to make it executable it could not infect his machine. **It defaulted safe.**,2017-08-02T12:13:36.487,204
6469,3068,0,Wow. I hadn't thought of that. Would you mind expanding a bit on how I can explain this in a separate lesson about using CSS stylesheets?,2017-08-02T12:39:13.043,150
6470,3021,0,_@Puppy Is that so?,2017-08-02T12:40:01.017,150
6471,3068,0,I would use an analogy. Automotive engineers don't choose car colors.  Screenwriters don't generally do costume design.,2017-08-02T13:14:34.650,1564
6472,3068,0,I see. Maybe you should include such analogies in your answer by editing the answer.,2017-08-02T13:34:22.400,150
6473,2998,0,_@Puppy But... but... but your website uses a stylesheet for most of the styling (in fact you have 6 stylesheets; talk about separate css file you have separate css file**s**). Moreover some of the `style` attributes (which belong to things with `id`s and are identical) that are generated by functions I suppose are empty.,2017-08-02T13:40:36.027,150
6477,3070,11,I think faulty engineering is a likelier ethical concern than Skynet.,2017-08-02T15:47:32.890,283
6478,2874,0,_@RichardPattis I see you have quite a collection of epigrams at your website as well as being a CS luminary. (I recognized your name but had to Google you to recall your claims to fame such as being the creator of the Karel programming language.),2017-08-02T15:50:09.383,283
6481,3071,3,_@nocomprende I don't disagree. I am reminded of the great wisdom of Dr. Ian Malcolm from _Jurassic Park_: Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. People need to stop to think. Instilling that need: Ay there's the rub.,2017-08-02T16:42:52.413,76
6482,3067,0,Well we already know that people will be able to cause havoc like that. Every car system that gets connected to the internet or has wireless connectivity at all is vulnerable and folks like Ken Munro regularly demonstrate this.,2017-08-02T17:22:31.143,2357
6485,3075,4,So the only ethical software is free software where free is defined by Stallman's turgid GPL. I disagree.,2017-08-02T19:27:10.570,2382
6486,3075,0,_@JamesKPolk but not all Free Software is ethical. I have amended answer to address this. You are saying that because software A has some aspect of ethical then it **is** ethical. And You are thinking that I am saying that all Free software is ethical. It is not that simple.,2017-08-02T19:49:03.080,204
6487,3075,2,_@JamesKPolk The Free Software Definition defines what Free Software is. The GPL is but one implementation. You should give them a read you will find that the language is very simple and short.,2017-08-02T19:51:47.973,204

6490,3072,0,The link dose not go to a page that explains what a MyBlock is. I am assuming that it is just a way to define a your own block ( a procedure what you ( and the C programming language ) are calling a function). But can you tell me what the distinction between external and not external.,2017-08-02T20:59:40.667,204
6491,3072,0,_@richard think of it as creating a DLL with one method in it and then simply using that one method from the DLL But not only once and more than one DLL. For that matter external or not external doesn't really make a difference,2017-08-02T21:02:36.087,150
6492,3070,9,Speaking as a machine learning guy I *wish* creating AIs was actually easy enough that a rogue programmer creating Skynet was a realistic concern.,2017-08-02T21:03:33.773,827
6493,3078,0,MyBlocks aren't like functions in that way. You need to reuse the tool for creating them if you want to make a change. That's why I didn't want much to do with the functions analogy because it isn't such a good one. Also what does teaching skills mean? Not quite sure I understand,2017-08-02T21:05:56.453,150
6494,3072,0,You are creating small programs with <11year olds. And you want them to create multiple object files. And to see an advantage of this?,2017-08-02T21:06:45.673,204
6495,3072,0,_@richard it's really a bit much to explain in comments if you're not familiar with the software or with Lego Mindstorms,2017-08-02T21:07:56.420,150
6496,3078,0,May be the kids are right may be it is better not to use them. I said ?€?teacher skills?€? to mean that after that you carry on being a teacher but it is outside the scope of the question. I would probably respond to the question with a question to try to lead them to using the MyBlocks.,2017-08-02T21:16:09.607,204
6498,3070,1,I highly recommend Ethics and Technology: Controversies Questions and Strategies for Ethical Computing by Herman T. Tavani.,2017-08-02T22:00:13.240,2386
6499,3070,0,Some good case studies would be Uber (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36843386) Ashley Madison (The site itself and the subsequent information disclosure) Encrypted Messaging vs National Security (http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/834597/WhatsApp-Facebook-removing-encryption-would-make-extremists-harder-track),2017-08-03T08:04:26.700,1874
6500,3076,0,You make it sound like paper voting somehow has less issues with trustworthiness. Technical solutions could theoretically improve trustworthiness (as you increase the number of people who would all need to be 'in on it') but it's a very complex issue. Anyway -1 if I could vote down on this site.,2017-08-03T08:12:25.810,675
6501,3075,1,-1 if I could downvote on this site. This doesn't seem to have anything to do with ethical software.,2017-08-03T08:15:48.373,675
6502,3075,1,Why would a disembodied brain have no empathy? Are you suggesting empathy comes from the liver or what? It's not a separate system that restricts the brain it's part of the brain. Not that I'm saying it's a good idea trying to model a true artificial intelligence after the ridiculously flawed machine built by natural selection :),2017-08-03T08:38:01.047,1816
6503,3075,1,_@Luaan No I was thinking that empathy comes from your interaction with others. But I would leave it as a discussion for the students to decide if they think I am correct.,2017-08-03T09:37:27.053,204
6504,3076,0,_@DavidMulder So if I provide a system for an election. It checks each voters ID. We could ensure anonymity by never ever ever connecting it to a network after it has been used. However there is no way for the voters to know. Then it takes your vote and reduces it to a count for each candidate. How will you as a candidate ensure that it does this correctly ( It could just make up the numbers in favour of the candidate that it wants to win).,2017-08-03T09:42:21.533,204
6505,3083,0,This is incredible. Wow.,2017-08-03T11:19:05.690,150
6507,3068,1,Actually it is worse than that. At some large companies with an important web presence there is a standards team sitting above both the content and layout teams. If the layout is one pixel off of the standard you do it over. One pixel.,2017-08-03T11:28:27.457,1293

6511,3083,0,Well make it credible then.,2017-08-03T12:05:48.663,2389
6513,3078,0,Can you give an example of what kind of program would have this feature?  I don't understand what you're saying in this answer.,2017-08-03T12:08:07.967,27
6514,3083,0,It's incredible becase it solves a problem with circumstances that I can't disclose (school stuff) but it doesn't **exactly** address the question...,2017-08-03T12:10:19.590,150
6516,3078,0,_@BenI. If you cut and paste then choose to change the code then you have to change every copy.,2017-08-03T12:29:26.270,204
6517,2585,0,I think this is a really good answer I'd only add to it that if you choose team work you should create clear and distinguished responsibilities for each individual in the team. This way you can prevent one person doing everything the rest doing nothing kind of teams.,2017-08-03T12:29:36.297,1681
6519,3076,0,_@nocomprende it has already been solved for paper based system but you may have improved it. However I see no need to use dollar bills: once country elects an untrustworthy precedent the dollar bill would be as trust worthy as raffle tickets. But still an improvement as it allows each voter to verify there part. The existing system focuses on the candidates and parties verifying the system. Can you see why it is impossible to implement using a computer system?,2017-08-03T12:37:51.007,204
6520,3076,0,While the answer has some merit in the context of the question (for example as a teaching aid to show layers of complexity for the use case of electronic voting systems) I would be *really* reluctant to make the  absolute claim that it is prinicipally impossible. Cryptography gives us tools similar to the pen&paper anonymous envelops tokens booths...; without having really analyzed it I could see possible solutions. Obviously part of it would be that local machines (+ their software) would be assumed to be compromised and such compromising must be detected by the crypto part.,2017-08-03T13:09:20.217,652
6521,3076,0,_@AnoE because you can not trust or audit the computer you need end to end checking (crypto). Now get this to work with anonymity and inability to show how you voted. The some solutions video talks about these but I see problems with all of the solutions (and I am to that clever). This is without having to resort to ?€?How does my mum verify a cryptographic hash by hand (because she dose not trust the computer).?€?,2017-08-03T13:23:54.213,204
6522,3076,0,_@richard: my point is not that I have outlined a working electronic voting system in a SE comment. ;-) My point is that is incredible hard to argue that solving XYZ is not possible and will never be possible. It is absolutely fine to argue that todays solution to XYZ suffer problems A B C and that nobody has yet found a working solution but your answer seems to say that it is theoretically and in all principles impossible to solve the problem.,2017-08-03T13:30:29.500,652
6523,3083,1,Oh and I'm meddling in the discussion as not a teacher but an IT professional - what I described is why things are done in practice just like the theory you want to teach says :),2017-08-03T13:35:15.863,2389
6524,3089,0,Thanks for the answer! I'd really like to have something that the students (who have little to no experience) can wire themselves but an LCD display is a great idea also.,2017-08-03T13:44:23.027,58
6526,3089,1,The important thing NOT to do is sending ANY high (non-zero-voltage) signals to the display before it is powered properly. Especially keeping any pin high and then switching on can let the smoke out.,2017-08-03T14:03:35.673,2389
6528,3071,0,The only person I would trust is a madman who would rather voluntarily live in poverty than allow himself to be pressured. Well since everyone else by definition can be pressured and bought to sneak in bad stuff in the code which therefore eradicates any trust.,2017-08-03T14:19:10.687,1933
6529,3086,0,What materials and resources do you have (e.g. motors sensors etc.),2017-08-03T14:36:51.790,150
6530,3088,1,_@nocomprende: absolutely. Not only the Web but the Internet as a whole. I was active in Fidonet Usenet etc.; one day DejaNews then Google just slurped in the whole Usenet history for eternity. Before that Usenet was kind of temporary. That was kind of *the* eye opener for me; before that nobody gave a d*mn about what they posted (private information etc.); afterwards not so much. If I check Google Groups now I easily find all my post history from the early 90's including real names mail addresses phone numbers in the signature and such things...).,2017-08-03T14:52:47.190,652
6531,3086,0,The school hasn't bought anything yet so I can use anything that isn't outrageously expensive.,2017-08-03T15:07:16.313,58
6532,3086,0,I see. hehe *starts formulating an answer*,2017-08-03T15:10:34.910,150
6533,3086,0,_@ItamarG3 Also you could do some fun stuff with non-uno boards like the primo (wifi BLE NFC IR etc.) or yun (runs openwrt linux distro) or mega (sooo many pins).,2017-08-03T15:16:27.883,58
6535,3071,0,_@nocomprende no idea what this Tao says or who he is. But there do definitely exist enough ways to pressure most people to stop trusting the concept trust altogether.,2017-08-03T15:58:10.710,1933
6536,3070,0,_@nocomprende: as someone that survived lymphoma I really really disagree with you.,2017-08-03T16:47:59.290,2394
6537,3076,0,_@AnoE My point is that no implementation can ever be found because the way it is implemented is impossible. You can be a black box analysis of the requirements. The requirements contradict: Actually the real requirements are very hard and only just possible but if you say that you must have a computer you add an implied requirement that no one can observe. With this no requirement there becomes a contradiction.,2017-08-03T17:27:35.357,204
6538,3090,0,You seem to be contradicting your bold statement (I noticed the pun). If I understood correctly you are saying that *because of the serious dangers that unethical IT workers might pose* they **shouldn't** be taught not to do those things? Even if one cannot foresee the ethical implications work might have I doubt it will ever be considered ethical to disclose secret information which leads to **direct** harm to others. That can be taught and [You don't need the gift of foresight](http://www.quotes.net/mquote/120399) to know what sort of ethics would be useful for your students.,2017-08-03T17:31:56.737,150
6539,3076,0,_@AnoE  I just looked up homomorphic encryption just to see what it was because there is a clam that this solves the E-voting problem. I predicted that it must have the property of ?€?whoever can read the result can find out who you voted for?€? for it to do what it was claimed to do. I don't understand the math of the fully homomorphic systems but their usage manuals confirmed my fear. It does not matter what happens in the box it must have these properties therefore in is of no use in implementing an E-Voting system. It looks like it may have other uses though.,2017-08-03T17:32:34.360,204
6542,3070,0,_@nocomprende: I still believe that the question cannot be stated like that. Lack of food and water are about lack of social structures such as Democracy that establish societies where people's wellfare is guaranteed. The cure for diseases is a completely different thing. Of course you could argue that sciencific and technological development are only possible where those basic problems are already solved but if they are then we will not have to choose. I think that your dichotomy is not well put.,2017-08-03T18:35:07.357,2394
6543,3090,0,_@ItamarG3 The point is that *teaching* (and thereby to some extent *defining*) ethics is not sensibly possible in a CS course. Regarding your example: Disclosing information that may harm others could be OK if the other person is a terrorist who plans an attack. Whether this is unethical can neither sensibly be discussed here nor in a CS course. On the other hand what you **can** teach is for example: **Which** measures may prevent unauthorized access to personal data or which pieces of information can be combined in order to identify someone from a purely technical point (...cont'd),2017-08-03T18:52:55.373,2393
6544,3090,0,(also @nocomprende ) : To **judge** whether something is ethical/unethical right/wrong good/evil depends on the context. Although you can [define a motto like Google did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil) this won't mean anything. Although there certainly is some consensus about what is right or wrong (regarding WW2 most people will call it wrong) **teaching** this is totally unrelated to the contents of basic CS courses. Or another summary: You should not teach *ethics* but the (technical) points of the work that may have *implications* for ethics.,2017-08-03T18:57:51.750,2393
6545,3070,0,Conversations like the above are appropriate in the classroom. https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom. Less so in comment streams.,2017-08-03T20:00:39.123,1293
6546,3071,0,_@mathreadler. Even the *Road Warrior* world had *some* trust. You have to get to *Lord of the Flies* to go without it. But perhaps you only mean trust but verify.  Also conversations to the classroom please: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom,2017-08-03T20:04:17.303,1293
6547,3090,0,Let me suggest that ethics isn't an infinite set of rules: if A then B but a set of principles and dispositions to act in a certain way. Physicians have been trained Do no Harm for quite a long time though the quote is attributed to Florence Nightingale. Too many rules: yes - don't even try. Infinitely applicable principles: yes,2017-08-03T20:10:25.723,1293
6548,3043,0,_@Ben Just because we think it's the same or as he is in Paris or London or Istanbul. Clearly it can't be mathematical ex-or.,2017-08-03T22:05:32.867,2349
6549,3043,0,_@mander I agree that He is in Paris or London or Istanbul is not equivalent to $inParis \oplus inLondon \oplus inIstanbul$ because that is a matter of 3 $\oplus$s.  But He is in Paris or London should be an identical statement to $inParis \oplus inLondon$.,2017-08-03T22:23:42.200,27
6552,3092,1,Actually the example you give has some legs. Go to a laundry and do some things in parallel. Also bottlenecks occur (no available dryers - curses). And travel is added at a couple of points. Even the old peanut butter sandwich algorithm example with one person vs (say) four. Better yet let the students suggest analogies and examine them for faithfulness.,2017-08-04T01:08:05.440,1293
6553,3092,0,_@Buffy I wasn't objecting to the laundry analogy just looking for additional ones. Asking for ones from students is a good idea.,2017-08-04T01:09:19.287,283
6554,3090,2,... assuming that the students are in their 20's: It's too late. You will not convert an (ethically) bad person into an (ethically) good person... This assertion is [not supported by the research](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/can-ethics-be-taught/) about ethics and morality. We don't even seriously *start* developing a cohesive moral perspective until our 20s and this process continues well into our 30s.  The very late teens and the early 20s are prime time in the brain for discussing moral and ethical action.,2017-08-04T04:43:30.960,27
6555,2988,1,While those are excellent books they are nigh impossible to read cover-to-cover even for seasoned academics yet alone students. If using this be sure you pick small self-contained sections and make sure beforehand that the students have all the preliminary knowledge required for understanding the chapters. Knuth is excellent if you want to go really deep but the amount of time you need to spend on each single page to properly understand it is *very* high.,2017-08-04T08:15:45.563,1370

6564,3090,1,_@BenI. It's not tooo surprising that the ethics department of a university claims that ethics can be tought ;-) But that's not the point. The point is rather that this ethics department will not teach the students that ethical implications can be modeled with binary logic on NAND gates. One could blatantly say: That's off-topic. Again: CS students should be aware of their responsibility and how their work may affect the lifes of others. But trying to *teach* them what is right or wrong (and for which reason) seems pointless for me as these are subjective open-ended discussions.,2017-08-04T12:51:49.483,2393

6581,3090,0,_@nocomprende The trolley example is *very* obvious and I referred to it in the answer. There are dozens of examples that are similarly (although not so obviously) subtle. To put it that way: The CS/engineer will not decide about the track that the trolley will take but he will have to make sure that there is a lever to switch the track in the first place and be aware that if this lever does not work something will happen what *others* defined to be ethically wrong (regardless of what this is).,2017-08-04T21:10:39.100,2393

6620,3133,0,In a similar way you could create a Jeopardy game. The Jeopardy answers are REs. The contestants are given an RE for some category and the first to ring the bell gets to reply with a valid match - in the form of a question of course. I used to keep a set of hotel desk bells for this sort of thing. This only works for deciphering/reading of course. As you proceed through a category the REs get harder. The categories can be RE types or something more elaborate.,2017-08-05T22:06:57.487,1293
6621,3134,1,I dont even know what you mean by `FA` or that being `F` yet I'm pretty good with regex. Similarly I don't understand why you think math is needed to use or understand them. They're *pattern matching* right? Not *formula matching*.,2017-08-06T00:18:28.283,104
6622,3134,1,_@GypsySpellweaver `FA` is finite automaton where `F` stands for `finite`.,2017-08-06T00:24:50.047,182
6623,3134,0,Ditto what @GypsySpellweaver said.,2017-08-06T00:24:58.320,2145
6624,3134,1,So how is knowing any of that important to using regex in programming or CLI? In implementing a regex interpreter that might be important can't say but that's not part of the question from the OP.,2017-08-06T00:33:38.170,104
6625,3134,2,_@GypsySpellweaver OP didn't ask of _using_ regex; the question is explicitly about _fundamentals_ and _understanding how it works_. You cannot teach fundamentals without resorting to fundamentals.,2017-08-06T00:38:07.857,182
6626,3134,0,Then one of us misread the question. I interpreted it as an introduction to the use of regex according to the statement: _The students don't need to know every detail but do need to know enough to work effectively and learn more_.,2017-08-06T00:47:25.030,104
6627,3134,1,_@GypsySpellweaver I agree on the misreading. OTOH I have seen enough senior programmers trying to parse stack languages with regexes. I am sure you did too. I do want my students to know what they are doing.,2017-08-06T00:53:59.097,182
6628,3124,1,Normally I wouldn't think of a broad question as a _good_ question. In this case I do. It is too broad to answer without having options all over the place. There's no way to design a capstone course without knowing _much_ more about the path the student has taken to reach this point. The question seems to be asking for examples of designs (hopefully good ones) for a capstone course. I'm going to guess that you _mean_ how to evaluate a designed course to determine if it _is_ a good one. I.e.: criteria not samples. I can't be sure however and had to VTC as too broad. :(,2017-08-06T05:15:31.623,104
6636,3124,0,Actually I'm very happy with examples provided they provide some background. I suspect that a reader of answers will get ideas from samples and use their own judgement about institutional fit. And caveats based on disaster evaluation is also good.,2017-08-06T13:27:35.220,1293
6637,3143,0,Thanks. I don't disagree about the course placement under appropriate circumstances. Can you say a bit more though about the course and its environment? The more you can write the better. Thanks again.,2017-08-06T13:29:09.543,1293

6678,3151,0,The bullet point 2 is exactly what the OP is about. Why `ls` could be an external program but `cd` can not? To answer this question one need to understand an entire Unix process model and I am afraid it takes a bit more than a Google query.

6679,3151,0,_@user58697 -- I'm not sure if that distinction is really important or relevant? If you were trying to make a simple shell the easiest thing to do would be to implement as much functionality as possible within a single codebase including handling both 'ls' and 'cd.

6694,3106,7,Forget 1966. Look at the average enthusiast home computing magazine of say 1986. You'd get whole listings usually in BASIC (with or without machine code interspersed) for games; usually a few different variants for different computers. (So you might get ones for the same game for say C-64 IBM PC and maybe one or two others.)

6707,3120,2,I'm in the same boat as Pharap. The most potent example of change was one of my professors was telling me about what it was like when he went to college for CS. He was on a punchcard system and they only had one computer. So every student would fill out their punch card get in a ten minute line and if they messed up at all they would have to go and do it all over. Assignments would take hours just because of how much time they would spend waiting in line to use the computer.,2017-08-07T17:54:43.573,1028

6710,2798,0,_@MichelBillaud Note that you don't need to have `setup()` or `draw()` functions in a Processing sketch. You can have a static sketch that just calls functions directly. I'd recommend starting out with that as it's even less overheard to learn.,2017-08-07T18:39:40.030,2068

6712,3108,1,Really the GPU can only compare to the 2008 server rack if you use it for very SIMD-friendly tasks. Of course much of the stuff that used to be and still is done on supercomputers _is_ actually such straightforward number-crunching but arguably most _interesting_ problems are not.

6718,2798,0,_@KevinWorkman in the first exercises they'll draw pictures with lots of function calls (ellipse etc).

6754,3105,0,_@EllenSpertus depending on what you do in your course perhaps give them an exercise where they can only use 48k of memory. I don't know how much of your course is applied mechanics vs theory but having them either make a program that uses <48k of memory or perform calculations on specific design to assess cycles and reveal that you couldn't even do that in 1968!. What usually helps people conceptualize differences is performing the comparison one's self.,2017-08-08T15:01:57.987,2186
6755,3105,0,_@EllenSpertus also try compare code practices from then and now. One of my teachers a while ago learned to code in the mid-70's and it showed; his code had short variable names because when he was learning they had to save drive and memory space. i.e. his code would have `int a = 0; ... if (a-- < 0) { ... }` whereas now we ***should always use descriptive variable names*** and would change it to `int userInputForProcessA = 0; ... if (userInputeForProcessA-- < 0) { ... }`. That variable name is 21x longer! Imagine not being able to do that because the computer literally couldn't store it all.,2017-08-08T15:12:09.677,2186

6767,3165,1,_Calculus I_ is such a basic how-to-think class that it seems like just about every college student should have it.  Also _Linear Algebra_ is highly relevant to Computer Science (in the sense of what CS is about as a field rather than just programming).  But _Calculus II_ might be a bit much for a basic degree in CS.,2017-08-08T20:00:28.383,39
6768,3165,0,I should disclaim that I'm not a huge fan of _Calculus II_.  Back when I took it it was all about doing integrals of weird combinations of trig functions e.g. $\int_{0{\leq}x{\leq}\pi}{\left(\tan^7 x\right)}{\left(\sin^3 x\right)}{\text{d}x}$ or junk like that which were often addressed through esoteric integration identities.  _Calculus III_ should be taught more often but _Calculus II_ felt like a waste of time.,2017-08-08T20:10:32.060,39

But there is more - it isn't just that many years ago we had computers with only 20 Meg. etc. It is that we did a LOT with those computers. Today it is assumed that you need megabytes of RAM & gigabytes of hard drive to run multiple processes but more than 30 years ago that was common on a desktop computer with 1/2 Meg. of RAM and 20 Meg. hard drive and years before that on room-filling mainframes with even less RAM & storage.

Python is often used as a 2nd language (after ?€?Scratch?€? or ?€?Snap?€?). Eiffel is a very good language to teach Object orientated. A touch of class is a book/course. It claims that it is quicker to learn Eiffel then C++ and C# than to start with C++ or C#.

My view is truly OOP just a deeper purer version than most people have and few OOP languages require. The only really serious software I've built (quite a bit) has been in OO languages. But my experience goes back a long way and I've tried to develop a style that is sustainable. My view isn't unique of course. Glad I was helpful.,2017-08-09T14:27:54.197,1293
6814,3177,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]!  I'm glad to see you posting around :) Particularly for this question which I also need an answer to. Usually when we post links we also give a (tiny) summary of the most relevant points. This provides some insurance that your answer will stay useful in case the link ever goes dead.,2017-08-09T15:07:24.807,27
6815,3174,0,Also feel free to come by [The Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) and say hi. That's where we all tend to hang out. ;-),2017-08-09T15:09:05.883,27
6816,3175,2,In FP functions may be applied to other functions or to data containing functions so the worlds of data and functions are not that much separated  (think about a sort() function with a comparator function as parameter).,2017-08-09T15:20:13.567,2103
6817,3188,1,I disagree with you that you will learn about *how these approaches differ* - they don't differ in any meaningful way.  They are orthogonal concepts from the start. It's like saying that you will learn how *tennis* differs from *clay* (of which the court is made) or how *paintings* differ from *paper*.,2017-08-09T15:36:14.610,27
6818,3188,0,_@BenI. I'm not enough of a programming languages expert to speak with my own authority on such a matter but I have a feeling the professor sees things differently. The end of the course dives in to how each approach takes fundamentally opposite approaches to program decomposition. From the lecture notes: We show that the two approaches [OOP and FP] largely lay out the same ideas in exactly opposite ways. https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/17sp/unit8notes.pdf,2017-08-09T15:39:57.930,76
6819,3170,3,_@Ali Even if you have received a helpful answer I would consider it a personal favor if you came by [Guidance](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/60468/the-guidance-office) to help us fix the question anyway. We've been discussing it but there's no way to re-open the question without some more input from you. The problem is that if the question is on-hold for long enough it will eventually get automatically deleted by the system. :( I want to find a way to preserve it so that it will have value for future visitors as well!,2017-08-09T15:41:06.383,27
6820,3188,0,In that case my disagreement is with the professor. Perhaps he overstated his case? The sentence that you have quoted would seem to be disproven by the existence of the many functional object-oriented languages.,2017-08-09T15:51:00.087,27
6824,3173,0,Thanks @EllenSpertus looking forward to be an active member in this site. :D,2017-08-09T16:45:46.397,2480
6825,3183,1,Well my serious software is also fun. It should be fun. In the above reference however serious also meant more than 15K deployments.,2017-08-09T16:46:50.287,1293
6827,3188,0,_@nocomprende Your statement is beautiful but I suspect it is ultimately more poetic than it is meaningful. Godel is talking about the limits of *provability* which is simply unrelated to the notion of whether various engineering philosophies can play nicely with one another.,2017-08-09T17:05:15.147,27
6828,3180,4,This is full of unsubstantiated opinions and reads more like a rant than an answer. Hype is orthogonal to utility: things can be anywhere in the matrix of sexy/boring and useful/superfluous.,2017-08-09T17:10:45.637,1790

6831,3177,0,I have seen some correlation between certifications and CyberPatriot. Do you have a specific certification in mind that relates well to the cybersecurity knowledge required of CyberPatriot? While there would not be time for students to reach certification-level a good text resource (i.e. prep book) is something I can work with.,2017-08-09T18:17:43.993,76
6832,3192,3,Your history is backwards. Object Oriented programming is the newbie here. FP predates the earliest proto-OO language by a decade. LISP a functional language based on Church's Lambda Calculus was the second high-level programming language ever created. It came out just 2-3 months after FORTRAN (the oldest high level programming language that exists).,2017-08-09T18:53:45.400,27
6833,3186,1,+1 You could compare object oriented to data oriented though.,2017-08-09T19:10:36.483,1430
6834,3186,3,The opposite of OOP would seem to be maintaining a separation between data and behavior.  (These opposites aren't mutually exclusive though - I've seen programs that mix imperative *and* functional *and* OOP *and* separation of data and behavior - they just do different things in different places.),2017-08-09T19:11:15.453,2505
6835,3193,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! A very in depth answer addressing many points. Thanks.,2017-08-09T19:22:51.077,150
6836,3150,0,_@Nat Yes I'll get my master degree in 2019,2017-08-09T19:30:52.523,2434
6837,3184,0,I would ask whether to use a nail or a screw e.g.: http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/tools/how-to/a18606/nails-vs-screws-which-one-is-stronger/ .  OO vs FP is different in that it's possible (reasonable) to do both e.g. making `x.square()` return a new object or writing a method `expr.calculated_type()` in a compiler.,2017-08-09T20:00:54.737,1622
6838,3189,2,That 2nd example `while (temperature < 100 && unHatched())` has no cast or type conversion: `<` takes 2 comparable and returns a boolean then `&&` takes 2 booleans and returns a boolean then `while` takes a boolean.,2017-08-09T21:17:44.143,204
6839,3180,0,I wouldn't say it's all the rage. The only popular 'functional' language I can think of is Rust and that's more than just plain 'functional' it has OO characterists too - it's more of a hybrid. All the older functional languages are preferred by mathematicians and scientists (or people who like maths and science). Granted many OO languages have adopted pseudo-functional features such as lambda expressions that doesn't necissarily make them interested in the functional paradigm rather the implementors have seen a feature they liked and found a use for and adapted it to suit their needs.,2017-08-09T21:55:16.207,1538
6841,3180,1,_@Pharap indeed that's what I call whims of fashion. Templates in C++ stateless and immutable structures all over the web JavaScript and Python being used as poor man's FP... Immutability and statelessness can be very appealing when dealing with concurrent processes (multithreading that has become mandatory since we started hitting the speed limit of a single CPU or networking after 30 years of calamitous efforts to synchronize data brokers) but still they are no silver bullets: costly hard to read relying on increasingly complex (and unreliable) tools to reach OOP performances.,2017-08-09T23:30:34.447,2486
6842,3192,3,_@BenI. I'm aware of the chronology. But in terms of mindshare in the lifetimes of undergraduate students (last ~20yrs) OOP has been utterly dominant. As programming and computer science are rapidly growing a decent subset (majority?) of persons in the craft came of age in the Javassic Era and are just now being exposed to what LISP and Erlang (and ML and Haskell) have been doing for decades.,2017-08-09T23:38:16.630,1790
6843,3180,1,_@kuroineko I wouldn't knock templates because they can be incredibly useful and time-saving *in the right hands* (emphasis important) the ability to write them is certainly more useful for library writers than regular programmers though. I can understand the want for statelesness (it's more about the web's core principle of robustness) but I agree with JavaScript and Python creeping into territory they are unfamiliar with (functionalism).,2017-08-10T00:06:41.360,1538
6845,3180,0,_@Pharap Even non-library writers can use templates for creating flexible data structures of their own. Getting deep into template metaprogramming is more something that would be relegated to library or framework code admittedly but the ability to delay type/etc. selection to the time of usage is incredibly useful for any programmer writing significantly complex C++ programs.,2017-08-10T01:26:32.127,654
6847,3180,1,_@JAB They can do if the problem they are solving is well suited to generics (such as writing datastructures or arithmetic types) but those cases occur less frequently than the standard case for most programmers. Plus there's the same danger with templates as there is with programming patterns and that's the this is cool let's make _everything_ a template mentality. The danger doesn't come from the templates themselves it comes from them being considered a cool thing to know - it attracts people who will learn _how_ to use them but not _when_ to use them.,2017-08-10T01:54:53.317,1538
6848,3157,0,I'm like 99% sure I remember Hazzan Lapidot and Ragonis but I don't have it in front of me to double check.  That said I had high hopes for the book but was disappointed when I read it.  It was more of a collection of their papers than a book; it lacked a clear unifying organization as a result.,2017-08-10T01:58:26.827,2317
6849,3157,0,It was also written in a style that I assume is education-ese - it was very list-driven.  It was list-driven the point where section 1 would contain a couple of quick sentences telling you what was in sections 1.1 1.2 and 1.3. Next came Section 1.1 which would tell you what 1.1.1 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 contained then section 1.1.1.  Within 1.1.1 they'd make a point then cite a list of stuff to support it.  I found it very hard to read.  I assume that this is just the style of writing (CS) Education Research papers but I'd love to be proven wrong :),2017-08-10T01:59:45.790,2317
6851,3147,0,Most importantly: call them regex or regexp not regular expressions or the person who later teaches them the Chomsky hierarchy will curse you from the depths of their heart.,2017-08-10T07:23:32.017,1219

6853,3195,3,I am afraid this answer conflates Functional Programming and Haskell. At the very least Type Inference Type Classes and Currying are NOT a hallmark of FP.,2017-08-10T08:12:00.113,1848
6854,3193,2,There is this Myth of the Sufficiently Smart Compiler. In theory a compiler could inline `g` and `h` into `f` perform an escape analysis to realize that the reference cannot have escaped and therefore modify the value in place since no observer can realize the modification. Of course a language without GC would make this much easier (eliding escape analysis partially).,2017-08-10T08:15:23.257,1848
6855,3195,0,_@MatthieuM. Could you give some examples of functional languages that do not have these features? Also I was under the impression that the majority of functional languages apply the principles of typed lambda calculus and use a hindley-milner type inference system.,2017-08-10T10:10:46.147,1538
6856,3195,0,Lisp? *(Not sure if it has currying)*,2017-08-10T10:45:22.173,1848
6857,3195,0,_@MatthieuM. Ok I checked and Lisp does indeed not have currying so I will mark that as a 'sometimes' feature (because it's still more prominent in functional languages than object oriented ones). That doesn't rule out type classes or type inference though. I suspect it's possible type classes are not considered a 'core' feature of functional languages but I'm pretty sure hindley-milner type inference is because of the relation to typed lambda calculus which is partly what sparked the idea of functional languages in the first place.,2017-08-10T10:50:55.547,1538
6858,3195,1,Lisp is dynamically typed so no type inference is necessary (or meaningful). Possibilities for making it statically typed are [discussed here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3323549/is-a-statically-typed-full-lisp-variant-possible).,2017-08-10T10:57:39.777,1848
6860,3192,0,Regarding your games programming argument: [John Carmack taught his son game programming in Racket](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/635839636754038784?lang=en) a LISP dialect.,2017-08-10T12:01:35.687,1370
6862,3196,1,I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because the teaching practice of the 60's has little bearing on teaching today. The question can be answered by the OP with a google search.,2017-08-10T12:48:00.743,1293
6863,3196,0,Note that much of what appears in early textbooks using some language are heavily influenced by the practice of programmers using _earlier_ languages. For example early Fortran books were very much assembly language like. Subroutines weren't used for problem decomposition but only to capture common computations. This was likely due to the relative difficulty of setting up subroutines in the assembly languages of the day. Early Pascal textbooks were very Fortran-like. It took a while to learn the new way of thinking.,2017-08-10T12:51:43.957,1293
6864,3196,0,_@Michel I have modified your question to pull it within the rules of SE (*list questions* must contain criteria to differentiate stronger from weaker answers).  I tried to make sure that it would still answer your original question; feel free to roll back the edit if I have misunderstood your intentions.,2017-08-10T13:32:05.583,27
6870,3187,0,This is the best answer here.,2017-08-10T14:05:20.717,27
6871,3192,1,_@nocomprende inexact metaphors are always stickier than exact but dry technical discourse :D,2017-08-10T15:07:50.593,1790
6872,3200,1,Welcome to Computer Science Educators! Whilst this may theoretically answer the question [it would be preferable](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answers/8259#8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.,2017-08-10T16:23:22.380,150
6873,3195,0,_@nocomprende I just about understood the horse grooming joke thanks to google but I don't understand the first sentence. No comprende no comprende.,2017-08-10T16:54:24.907,1538
6874,3195,0,_@MatthieuM. I shall mark that as also a 'sometimes' feature but I believe it's a somewhat popular one that's typically considered to be a feature expected more from functional languages. Or at least [C2 seems to think so](http://wiki.c2.com/?TypeInference). I suspect this is due to the great influence of ML upon other functional languages.,2017-08-10T17:01:21.993,1538
6875,3175,2,I think it's also important to note how difficult it can be to read and comprehend the benefits of something like functional programming.  For me anyway it took programming imperatively for a long time to realize the complexity that modified state brings.  Once I realized that was a real problem I had to solve functional programming was a natural solution and all the material explaining what functional programming was started to make sense.,2017-08-10T17:30:10.253,2526
6877,3195,1,_@nocomprende I am aware of that saying and its application to computer languages. It's often applied to patterns too. (The bit I got hung up on was the word 'tale' which as far as I know is a synonym for 'story' which doesn't really fit the sentence.) Technically humans are animals. At any rate this seems like an esoteric slightly poetic tangent rather than a comment about the answer.,2017-08-10T17:44:23.520,1538

6880,3195,1,_@nocomprende I was just putting in a warning that we often need to take a step back from debates and consider carefully the basis for the whole question.  - _that_ is a fair point. What you had to say was valid I think your earlier comments were just a bit too crypic at what they were getting at. (Either that or they made perfect sense and I'm just tired.) It's up to you whether you delete them or not they might be considered 'too chatty' they might not be - I can't really say either way.,2017-08-10T18:07:56.833,1538
6881,3202,1,Hi welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a bit of a stub answer. Good answers take a little more work.  Could you flesh out your theory a little bit?,2017-08-10T19:53:52.710,27
6882,3183,2,Functional languages often use the term variable like mathematics ?€? a name for some value which is constant during its lifetime but the same name may refer to a different value the next time the algorithm is run. A true constant has the same value each time.,2017-08-10T21:10:31.093,653
6883,3158,0,Hi Joel! You've been posting a lot of answers lately (and I might add high quality ones at that). Feel free to come by [The Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) and introduce yourself :),2017-08-10T23:50:57.683,27
6884,3178,0,?€?While in an OOP paradigm you'd likely do some_list.sort() and the next time you use some_list it will be sorted.?€? No. With an **imperative** paradigm you'd do `sort(some_list)` (procedural) or `some_list.sort()` (OO) to change `some_list`. OO vs procedural is orthogonal to imperative vs functional. In functional OOP you'd do `let sorted_list = some_list.sort()`.,2017-08-11T00:17:36.030,124
6885,3195,2,Currying is inherently possible in any functional language but whether it's used has little relation with the design of the language. For example Standard ML and Ocaml have a very similar core but SML favors tuples as function arguments while Ocaml favors currying. (?€?Favors?€? means that this is what the standard library uses and the compiler optimizes this case better.),2017-08-11T00:21:33.580,124
6886,3195,0,?€?In a functional language values are created and they do not change?€?. In a *pure* functional language. For example Haskell does not allow values to change (or rather it requires going through a monad); ML discourages mutable values; Lisp tends to use them a lot.,2017-08-11T00:23:06.387,124
6887,3195,0,Type inference is only very loosely connected to functional languages in that the most advanced type systems tend to be implemented on functional languages. Lisp is statically untyped (singly typed if you want to get technical). Many imperative languages are statically typed.,2017-08-11T00:24:53.710,124
6890,3196,0,_@buffy what seems the logical order of exposition in today's textbooks is heavily influenced by the quantity of textbooks published before on a similar subject.,2017-08-11T06:05:35.903,2103
6892,3195,0,_@Gilles Note that these are not all completely necessary for something to be considered a functional language but they are features that are commonly associated with functional languages because they can be found in a wide variety of functional languages particularly the most popular ones.,2017-08-11T09:26:59.647,1538
6894,1222,0,The problem with the box idea is that an assignement x=y  doesn't move the object to the other box but makes a copy.  So the analogy is limited. Except if you're talking about unique_ptr in C++ :-),2017-08-11T10:54:45.387,2103

6909,3210,1,I'm afraid it will be difficult. I have a similar issue with my grandson (a bit younger). I have a lot of materials that are age-appropriate and _I'm_ motivated but he is not so nothing has happened. If he likes to build things in general then you might have a hook (Lego Mindstorms say). That hasn't worked yet with my grandson though. :-(,2017-08-11T18:55:08.560,1293
6910,3210,1,Well think about it this way... I don't want to motivate him to the point of steering him into a career he finds boring.  He's actively looking for career choices so I want to give him something that isn't so dry that it turns him off immediately.  I want to take a give him the tools and let him play on his own approach.  I don't want to try to talk him into the career just expose him to it.,2017-08-11T18:58:29.913,2550
6912,3212,1,Yea I threw the word test in there for lack of a better one but I very much just want to give him something that he can work on to see if he enjoys it.  I think him enjoying it is better than him being naturally good at it.,2017-08-11T19:01:09.793,2550
6913,3212,0,_@JPhi1618 I agree with that last sentence 1000%. I'd definitely recommend checking out Processing. Maybe run through a few introductory lectures together and see if he takes it from there.,2017-08-11T19:03:32.573,2068

6917,3192,0,I don't quite understand what you are getting at with the rant (is it a rant?) about Java.  OOP was around for quite a while before Java and I don't recall any controversy over whether Java's flavor of OOP was good when compared to Smalltalk.  In any case Java was more a take on C++ than it was on Smalltalk.  There _was_ serious controversy over C++ but the controversy I remember came from C programmers.  Still does come from C programmers now that I think of it.,2017-08-11T20:11:53.797,224
6921,3210,1,_@Buffy Why the sad emoticon? Every kid is different and it's not reasonable in the very least to expect them to do whatever it is that you want them to do.

6923,3213,2,PS: I don't like Scratch. At all. Too kiddish for me. While you can ask them to take a look at it if they find it boring don't insist. Keep this in mind some kids just want to jump into the real stuff. Plus typing stuff out is fun! :P,2017-08-11T21:48:56.837,1912

6926,3192,0,_@WayneConrad what I'm getting at with my not-rant is that Java was a juggernaut the left it's mark on almost every corner of Programmingland. Many people (not the least of which were Sun's marketing department) hailed it as the One True Language to Replace All Others. Except that it wasn't. The fact that it wasn't quite low-level enough to displace C in some domains and not quite high level enough to replace scripting languages in others doesn't make Java good or bad. In fact the social-phenomenon aspect makes it rather hard to assess Java simply on its own merits.,2017-08-11T23:47:27.613,1790
6927,3192,0,...con't so you can't just talk about OOP without talking about Java which not only popularized many OOP concepts but made them *mandatory* knowledge for working programmers. I may not like it but denying the reality would be foolish in the extreme. Simula didn't do that smalltalk didn't do that python didn't do that. Neither did C++ as you point out: people could and did just keep writing C if they wanted to. Java did that. Or more precisely Sun's brilliant and insanely expensive marketing campaign did that.,2017-08-11T23:51:07.883,1790
6928,3210,1,All the kids these days with their tablets and their phones and their wearables and whatnot. Get the kid a used tablet and a copy of android studio (or xcode if that's how he rolls) and turn him loose. Android studio has a great intro tutorial to get a hello world app up. I'm sure xcode has something similar for iOS.,2017-08-12T00:02:00.130,1790
6929,3213,1,I as well don't like Scratch and am a young programmer *::high fives::* great advice.,2017-08-12T00:46:18.470,919
6930,3157,0,I just purchased the first 3 of these books.  This is an awesome answer!,2017-08-12T00:56:24.530,27
6931,3210,1,Same way as for *any* subject: start with the **PURPOSE** of the subject and go from there.  (Though most teachers don't do this for most subjects.),2017-08-12T01:05:59.220,1103
6944,3175,0,Others here have mentioned the theory behind functional programming. If you want to see the theory behind OOP see [_A Theory of Objects_](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Objects-Monographs-Computer-Science/dp/0387947752) by Abadi and Cardelli. (Not cheap not easy).,2017-08-12T14:51:26.027,1293
6948,345,0,Actually computers have nothing to do with Turing machines that are abstract machines to reason about computability. TM can be implemented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYw2ewoO6c4 but nobody will ever use them as the basis for practical calculations. When Turing worked on computers at Manchester they were based on the registers alu memory etc model. When programming such devices most of the operations are moving data from one place to another (thus the concept of variables holding data) and adding subtracting etc. And it fitted with what you wanted to do with computers at the time.,2017-08-12T16:19:09.070,2103

6961,3221,3,Can you say a bit more about what the students have already done and what they can be expected to know? Also are you pretty free to design the course or does the existing design impose constraints on you? Just edit your question to add more if possible. Also if you are new to this site welcome. We will try to be as helpful as we can.,2017-08-13T12:41:00.370,1293
6964,3222,0,A project course looks like a great idea but I am not sure how to combine it with presenting the abstract OOP concepts. Isn't a project course encouraging students to just quickly writing code that works rather than to think about OOP practices that only pay out in the long run?,2017-08-13T14:10:46.553,1873
6966,3217,0,Would you agree that calculus problems are like puzzles?,2017-08-13T16:26:27.933,2550
6967,3220,1,Very interesting take.  You bring up some good points that I didn't think of.  I appreciate you bringing you personal experience to this.,2017-08-13T16:30:47.337,2550
6968,3217,1,_@JPhi1618 I'd say it depends on the problem. However in this instance to test a student's interest/aptitude I would stay away from subject-specific skills (e.g. calculus) and focus on logic puzzles that don't rely on subject-matter ability outside of CS.,2017-08-13T16:38:22.313,76
6969,3196,2,An adequate answer would be scan images of old textbook tables of contents for example.  Definitely not easy to find by a google search for obsolete books of the 60's if you ever tried...,2017-08-13T16:51:42.387,2103
6970,2864,0,It doesn't support buttons and text fields like you see with JavaFX or Swing. However it does support interactivity with the keyboard and mouse so you can get creative with students providing input. Although it isn't a extensive as Swing or JavaFX the tradeoff is that you get a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for integrating graphics and user input. I'd be more than happy to chat offline about how I used this for my AP CS kids and to bounce around ideas for accomplishing what you want.,2017-08-13T19:05:22.827,1743
6971,3196,0,The way it's written now you've answered your own question.  If that's not the case then it's unclear what you're asking.,2017-08-13T19:28:49.913,27
6972,3191,1,You have broken this into steps that are too small.  There is a lot of namespace clutter here.,2017-08-13T20:12:19.470,21
6973,3191,0,_@ncmathsadist What exactly do you mean by namespace clutter in this context? I would assume these are all local variables inside a function. Also please keep in mind that the point of this exercise is to get the student to a point where they no longer need to do this. Code you write while learning != code you write in real life.,2017-08-13T20:43:44.770,2068
6976,3191,0,too many variable names.,2017-08-14T01:14:54.130,21
6978,3191,0,_@ncmathsadist You understand that the point of this exercise is to break it down into smaller steps right? And that this type of code is meant for learning and not for production?,2017-08-14T02:17:09.890,2068
6979,3196,0,Sorry if  it's not clear enough : my answer states that I've  not found any example of procedural first approach in imperative programming in good old times (say before 1980) yet.   Before I conclude there is none I'd like to check from textbooks from that period how they ordered the concepts. In the late seventies I read all the programming books (fortran) in french from the university library probably representative for what was published at the time (not very good books) they were all on the same model.  So I'd like to check for textbooks in english.,2017-08-14T08:42:48.873,2103
6984,3196,0,_@MichelBillaud Absent scanning _every_ textbook ever written in that time frame it is impossible to prove it didn't exist. That's a classic problem in many area: proving the non-existence of something.,2017-08-14T13:09:52.030,104
6985,3191,0,but not too small.,2017-08-14T13:33:31.857,21
6986,3210,1,_@nocomprende I see what you're saying but he's in a small town and doesn't have any friends that are into it and parents do not have technical jobs.  He's just literally never been exposed to it and hasn't had anyone to ask questions.,2017-08-14T14:18:01.133,2550
6987,3225,1,Your mention of simplicity over efficiency is important to note. Students should of course be aware of the tradeoff. And note that if the expected number of data points is expected to be small then a simple solution may be much more valuable than a theoretically efficient one.,2017-08-14T14:23:41.793,1293
6990,3223,2,This sounds like a good subject for a debate rather than this forum. Perhaps you could talk to Prof Regis at U Washington to see what might be arranged for the next SIGCSE conference. I'd guess that there are many people near you who have tried each path and it would be interesting to see what they have to say.,2017-08-14T15:04:25.897,1293
6991,3223,1,_@nocomprende -- while that's true I'm mainly interested in helping beginners who are evaluating their options right now and don't have the luxury of waiting another half-decade or two for bootcamps to become more of a known quantity. In particular I guess I'm looking primarily for data to help people make informed decisions -- analysis and comparison is a nice bonus but probably unnecessary.,2017-08-14T15:07:50.547,732
6993,3191,0,_@ncmathsadist I'm really not sure what your point is. If this was production code I *might* agree with you. But this is code meant to teach the process of breaking things down into smaller steps. Smaller is better in this context.,2017-08-14T16:02:40.123,2068
6994,3220,0,According to this metric I have zero potential for programming. Hope nobody tells my boss.,2017-08-14T16:20:35.923,2068
6995,3196,0,_@GypsySpellweaver Of course I'm not interested at *every* textbook. Only some which would attest the existence of a real procedural approach. It doesn't seem impossible that someone still remembers what they learned/taught at the time. And maybe keeped the books.,2017-08-14T17:26:36.857,2103
6996,3223,2,_@nocomprende *If bootcamps are terrible they will fail and disappear.* They will only fail and disappear if people like us do the research and spread the word that they are terrible.,2017-08-14T17:30:51.443,2068
6997,3223,2,I would also love to see a study on bootcamps but I'm afraid it's even more complicated than your question. For example you really need to factor in the **quality** of the job that's guaranteed by the bootcamp. I've seen more than a few bootcamps that end up just being cleverly disguised recruiters for data entry jobs. Learn how to be an engineer! Now fill out these spreadsheets for 8 dollars an hour. That is technically a full-time position but it's not what was promised. That's the real danger to be aware of IMHO.,2017-08-14T17:32:44.477,2068
6998,3218,1,Have you considered submitting your teaching materials to open-source teaching initiatives to help other teachers (perhaps less experienced with programming) teach their own programming courses?,2017-08-14T17:35:46.900,2068
6999,3196,0,I'm guessing that _procedural first_ approach is intended to mean teaching how to use procedures before learning how to use a `while` loop for example. If such is the case it seems impossible as the procedures need the smaller building blocks just as much as the main program does.,2017-08-14T17:39:09.217,104
7000,3196,0,You dont even need variables. Consider the task of drawing a picture from a number of calls (rect ellipse etc) to primitive functions. You will probably appreciate a linguistic support to the idea of splitting the work into parts : functions. Even void and without parameters at the beginning. Is'nt it more appropriate  than groups of statements separated by comments ?,2017-08-14T17:48:48.057,2103
7005,3231,1,Most big projects aren't tackling big problems; they're tackling all the little details in a small but realistic problem. Managing this complexity is where people seem to get stuck because strategies that work on the scale of a textbook exercise stop working.,2017-08-15T00:19:18.577,1102
7006,3230,0,I think there is a middle ground between tutorials and the kind of big projects you describe here and I guess that's the kind of projects the OP talks about. Because in my experience that is already considered too big by self learners right after the tutorial phase. Usually anything with more then three or four toy classes seems to be a challenge because in most tutorials you learn the syntax to write classes inheritance and so on and the theory but the self learner then struggles to apply this even to a small or medium project. Which is already big from their point of view.,2017-08-15T07:28:39.433,847
7007,3230,0,For the second bullet point I would recommend implementing a card or board game or to re-implement some given program. It can be implemented by the self learner alone and the complete specification/set of rules is already given.,2017-08-15T07:31:40.217,847
7008,3194,0,_@MichelBillaud can you repeat your comment with context and grammar; I have no idea what its meaning is.,2017-08-15T09:37:54.363,204
7010,3230,0,Implementing from a written description is decidedly not the same as working for a client. The point is having another person in the loop who sets the direction and can even change it. What you describe is still in the simplest part of the space even if the program is larger than what you normally build. You could use something like that for the first method however. Find a couple of other people to form a team and build a game that way.,2017-08-15T10:11:05.150,1293
7011,3194,0,n and n+1 (I suppose n is strictly positive) have the same number of digits (in the decimal representation) except when n is made of sequence of 9's.  That is when n = 10^k - 1 for some k (and then n+1 = 10^k. n has k-1 digits n+1 has k. Thus the name of a predicate should state something about n not being a power of 10 minus 1.,2017-08-15T10:45:55.727,2103
7012,3230,0,I'm not sure bigger project means working for a client in the context of the question. Self learning beginners usually struggle with the first ?€?big?€? project(s) after tutorials where ?€?big?€? means big for _them_ not necessarily for an experienced professional programmer. It might be a days work or a weekend project for those.,2017-08-15T10:46:48.430,847
7013,3228,2,Can you clarify what kinds of larger projects you mean or what the goal of the self learner is here?  In light of Buffy's answer: Are we talking about training for the job market or about programming for fun/out of interest or both?,2017-08-15T10:50:36.563,847
7014,3194,0,_@MichelBillaud I grok you now. However to name something well you have to know the intention. It should not be based on how it does it but on what it does. That is what externally visible behaviour it has.,2017-08-15T11:02:46.993,204
7018,3228,0,By the way there's a [Topic Challenge](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/q/275/58?cb=1) going on.,2017-08-15T14:51:56.783,150
7019,3194,0,Of course you're right.    boolean hasTheSameNumberOfDigitsAsItsSuccessor(int n) { return ! isAPowerOf10(n+1); },2017-08-15T15:01:05.173,2103
7021,3228,0,_@BlackJack -- good point. I edited my question to try and clarify. To answer your specific question: the self-learner could be both training for the job market or learning to code for fun.,2017-08-15T15:14:36.580,732
7022,3189,0,May be he could write such statements but he should know (and use) other ways to express the same idea. For example : write auxiliary functions (here numberOfDigits(int n)) use superfluous parentheses  to help readability ( around temperature<100).  The key challenge in programming is to manage the complexity and the readability of the text we produce. The milk quickly goes over.,2017-08-15T15:20:41.210,2103
7023,3235,1,This seems a bit chicken-and-egg? In my experience companies tend to prefer hiring people who have already have a few large non-trivial projects on their resume/portfolio that demonstrate their potential -- that's why many universities make their students work on projects or capstones as part of their curriculum and why many people advise job seekers to work on side projects. If the only way to become good at larger projects is by getting a job but employers prefer hiring entry-level devs who've already completed larger projects what is a beginner supposed to do?,2017-08-15T15:20:49.473,732
7024,3235,0,_@Michael0x2a You are talking about something else my position is that in order to actually reach professional level you have to be a professional for some time university projects are not going to cut it. And yes it definitely sucks being a beginner they are supposed to get by that's what people do. My cousin for example looked nearly 6 month for his first job after graduating. Even then it was for a quarter of the average salary his next job ~1.5 years later was much better and with the one after that ~3 years after graduation he was able to make standard software developer salary.,2017-08-15T15:41:47.197,2149
7025,3235,0,I'm not sure I agree but that's probably not a debate worth having atm. To work within the framework of your answer: I'm interested in helping beginners and self-learners who struggle to complete even university-level projects especially the ones that are expected to take a few weeks to complete. What advice would you give to those beginners?,2017-08-15T16:00:12.567,732
7026,3235,0,_@Michael0x2a What kind of help are we talking about? If you can have them actually work with you(or some other experienced developer) on a project for a long period of time then it's possible. If you are talking about writing a tutorial or some forum/messages to help then imho it's not possible.,2017-08-15T16:18:46.350,2149
7028,3235,1,it seems we fundamentally disagree on the premise then. Based both on my personal experience and from watching the progress of a variety of other self-learners I feel it is very much possible for a self-learner to scale up to independently working on large projects without any direct guidance. You can find examples of what I mean by help by looking at the other answers that have been posted so far.,2017-08-15T16:32:17.490,732
7029,3235,0,_@Michael0x2a It's definitely possible just in my opinion very difficult. I started programming when I was 10 worked on my first big project in a professional environment when I was 18 and learned **a lot** from my team lead I really don't see how I could've replaced those 3 years with self learning. Your personal experiences are obviously different and I hope you will succeed in helping other people to follow your path. As to the other answers...,2017-08-15T16:50:49.213,2149
7030,3235,0,_@Michael0x2a **Buffy** - Talks about teamwork and specifications not code complexity. **Kevin** - Don't work on big projects. **Itamar** - It's all in your head. I don't see how any of this is helpful.,2017-08-15T16:52:14.500,2149
7032,3194,0,_@michel I would find out what the intention of the code is. Instead of searching for mathematical explanations that are coincident with the intention. These coincident functions are good for implementing but will not make the code easier to understand. E.g. isHouseOnLeft(int house number) may use isEven(int n) for some roads (but will also need direction of travel ). So call it by what it does not by how it does it.,2017-08-15T17:05:22.480,204
7035,3228,0,Just saw your update we were talking about completely different things. You meant large project (*experienced programmer might be able to pull off the same thing in a weekend*) I thought you meant large projects as in > 100k sloc ;-). You can ignore my answer it's not relevant. What you want is definitely possible with good learning material. Unfortunately I don't have any concrete advice(maybe just tell them to read some good books and not tutorials?).,2017-08-15T17:32:15.893,2149
7036,3194,0,if(hasTheSameNumberOfDigitsAsItsSuccessor(n)) is a clear explicit and non-ambiguous description of the intention of if((n+).length() == (((n+1)+).length())). Checking powers of 10 and computing/comparing the number of digits are 2 possible implementations.  The formula as given relies on tricks (eg.  n+  to convert a number into a string - instead of the standard Integer.toString()) and code duplication (for n and n+1). So it should never have been written as such from the beginning. if (numberOfdigits(n) == numberOfDigits(n+1)) is ok of course.,2017-08-15T17:36:21.607,2103
7037,3189,0,Another point : be careful with such exercices. Some students could conclude they are expected to write programs this way if they want to look smart.,2017-08-15T17:45:30.033,2103
7038,3228,0,*This question has been entered into [The Being Selfish challenge question contest](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/275/topic-challenge-02-being-selfish).*,2017-08-15T20:47:11.457,27
7042,3218,0,_@KevinWorkman That could make a good answer. Can you write it up with advantages of doing this. And why to use a Free / Open-Source licence.,2017-08-16T11:27:02.987,204
7044,3191,0,It's about seeing *what happens* in some parts of the expression (namely:  `n+`) not necessarily refactoring it into many variables until they're all dead.,2017-08-16T12:57:01.790,2103
7047,3199,0,When you are teaching about data structures some points in implementation are explictely dictated by the requirement of some operations about their complexity (eg. O(1)  for direct access O(n) for traversal etc). So it depends on the question you ask : write a function + tell about the complexity or write a function with the best complexity you can.,2017-08-16T14:39:20.610,2103
7048,3224,0,I often read about studies conducted without controls or at tiny scales. But not all research is this way! With regards to research broadly the best resource I've found is How People Learn which really goes through the mechanics of learning: how brains attenuate encode information etc. That book is really very elucidating. The other good resource is What Works Clearinghouse which the US DoE publishes every 10 years. It ranks research results by how strongly they are actually supported (by multiple studies large groups strong controls etc). The strongly supported stuff is great.,2017-08-16T15:38:09.813,27
7049,3224,0,(continued) You will be unsurprised to hear that the strongly supported research is *not* highly prescriptive. I share your wariness about the use this approach commands from ON-HIGH. But bad usage doesn't invalidate the best of educational research which really can be very good. That's what I want to contribute to :),2017-08-16T15:41:26.463,27
7053,3191,0,Smaller is not _always_ better.  If it was then we'd all be writing assembly language.  IMO `nPlusOne` is slightly _harder_ to read than `(n+1)`.  Also the goal of the exercise is to compare the number of digits in `n` to the number of digits in `(n+1)` but the word digits appears nowhere in your simpler example.,2017-08-16T17:17:57.820,1269
7054,894,0,It won't be _like_ learning an additional programming language it _is_ a programming language.,2017-08-16T17:23:40.593,1269

7058,3242,0,I didn't DV but it feels like you need to connect this back to the question a bit more.  It's also not entirely clear what you mean by lost progress.,2017-08-16T19:14:48.980,27
7060,3243,4,A polynomial $O(n^3)$ cannot possibly grow faster than the Moore's exponent. I understand what you are trying to convey but I strongly suggest you to rephrase.,2017-08-16T22:51:44.200,182

7095,3240,1,Maybe an 8a: Write code that doesn't _need_ comments. Comments are for explaining why the code does what it does ?€? if that's not obvious from the code itself anyway. So if you feel the need for a comment think for a moment how the code can be written clearer so it doesn't need a comment. This comes down to names most of the time but also to restructuring code and/or data sometimes.,2017-08-18T09:29:14.810,847
7097,3256,0,I would suggest points 3 and 4 of this post: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/3251/1293. It will take you about one class period but if carefully done demonstrates both the technique and its benefits. I think that book describes what might happen _after_ such an introductory lesson.,2017-08-18T13:47:03.163,1293
7100,3243,0,_@user58697 Is the wording now sufficiently clear?,2017-08-18T14:10:41.830,27
7101,3257,0,_@Buffy The original poster mentioned high school so I was assuming that he is with his students when they are doing their programming assignments.,2017-08-18T20:58:39.590,2145
7103,3257,0,_@CSCheerleader. probably not a safe assumption. Also In the situation you were describing I'd rather do teaching by wandering around nudging rather than employing my serious face. I think positive rather than negative enforcement  is likely more effective. I might sit down as a second navigator for example and just make the appropriate comments. Note that you can edit your own answers to be more complete.,2017-08-18T21:08:56.273,1293
7105,3259,4,Normally assembly code is still symbolic and needs to be further translated to machine code (assembled). But is there a reason that you want to go to actual hardware? Many compiler courses compile for a machine simulator instead. That gives you the chance to use a more rational machine definition than most actual hardware provides. Real machines can be messy.,2017-08-18T23:53:39.627,1293
7106,3259,1,Two additional problems you need to solve with real hardware is (a) a link between the development and target machines and (b) if the target has an OS dealing with that as well. The complications are one reason for using pseudo-hardware instead so the students can focus on the compilation process itself - especially in a first compiler course.,2017-08-19T00:00:42.073,1293
7107,3259,1,Also welcome to [cseducators.se]! I have starred this question as one that I am interested in. In my program we teach on a simulation of the 6502. The limited number of registers and commands make it pretty manageable. I hope to hear more from you around the site.,2017-08-19T00:27:16.197,27
7108,3257,0,I'm going to guess that you would do better with a rule not based on time. If you interrupt the driver's thought process with a bell you set them back.  The driver should be focused like a laser. Since I use small tasks with required tests the switch can be at the end of a task. If the students task themselves then at the end of say each method written though even that is a bit artificial. But always switch when the driver is stuck and the navigator has a suggestion.,2017-08-19T00:45:25.533,1293
7109,3259,1,And the 6502 has a reputation as a pretty clean design. So does the Zilog Z80 if you can find a simulator. Intel hardware tends to be more complicated after the first couple of editions (i.e. 8080). @BenI. have you got a reference for the 6502? Maybe a full answer is warranted.,2017-08-19T00:52:00.510,1293
7110,3257,0,The time rule has worked for me.  I do think your idea of having the periods be based on tasks instead of time is a good one and will consider using that  in the future when the opportunity affords itself.,2017-08-19T01:30:41.190,2145
7111,3259,0,Thanks for the answers Yes the students will build a simple compiler and of course this will generate assembly code (MOV LOOP etc). So with this can we play with some hardware or do we need something more?,2017-08-19T02:04:10.970,2055
7112,3240,0,_@BlackJack I strongly disagree it's arguable if striving to write code that doesn't require comments is generally good it's definitely a terrible advice for a beginner. I don't think that this is something they should be concerned about and it will make there task of moving to bigger projects much more difficult. \@heather This is a very good answer please leave it as is or change it only based on your personal experiences.,2017-08-19T02:09:25.470,2149
7113,3259,0,It might be a good idea for you to visit the classroom to chat. I think you can get some good advice there: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom,2017-08-19T12:14:33.640,1293
7114,3259,0,One idea maybe is to not target hardware but instead target LLVM (which in turn can target all sorts of devices -- even web browsers). Caveat: I've never done this myself so don't know for certain if this is actually a good idea or not from a pedagogical point of view.,2017-08-19T19:00:02.503,732
7115,3259,0,The MIPS SPIM simulator is good that's what I learned on in college.,2017-08-19T22:05:49.107,1299
7116,3260,0,Thanks a lot fro you answer Ben. Didn't know about this and sounds like a great idea. Im interested in purchasing one of this computers in eBay. What computer do you recommend us to use? And after we have it. How can we pass assmebly code to it? and through what?  Thanks. Any manual o explanation?,2017-08-19T23:04:54.210,2055
7117,3260,0,I haven't dealt with the hardware myself though that complete assembly specification goes so far as to give the byte-code for each processor command. I'd guess that each of the machines provides their own way to enter your assembly programs.  (You may need to find a way to transfer files to a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk.),2017-08-19T23:06:55.497,27
7118,3260,0,Then that works for me :) Thanks a lot Ben. I'll do a research about this. And I think we will start working in building a compiler for the 6502. Thank you so much for your help :) Greetings.,2017-08-19T23:18:25.550,2055
7119,3240,0,_@Oleg Why isn't it generally good for beginners to aim to write code that's clear and understandable? Thinking about and finding good names for instance is very important. If you can't come up with good names it is often a sign that the problem or the solution isn't fully understood or a function mixes different concerns or data structures bundle things that don't actually belong together. Structure in code and data becomes more important the bigger projects get so I think it is actually very good for beginners and others to think about expressing their ideas in understandable code.,2017-08-20T10:17:02.473,847
7120,3240,0,_@BlackJack Having good names is a good suggestion. However I think that trying to Uncle Bob there code will only confuse them and make there task much more difficult. If they manage to come up with a 40 line function that does what they want adding some comments that explain what each part does and moving on will be better for them. Clean Code is meant for more advanced programmers and in my personal opinion many times I saw Uncle Bob take a perfectly fine and readable code and make it much less readable. I do admit that it's the minority opinion.,2017-08-20T13:03:30.227,2149
7121,3262,0,I agree very much with the practical considerations you've outlined here. When I think about this issue in my own classroom I worry more about attentional and learning aspects and I'm not sure if I'm getting this right. Welcome to [cseducators.se]! I hope we hear more from you around the site.,2017-08-20T13:57:14.823,27
7122,3262,1,And of course I totally disagree but welcome to the site and we look forward to your future contributions. Interesting profile too.,2017-08-20T15:20:55.533,1293
7123,3262,0,Folks thank you for the welcome.   When you say attentional I am guessing you are referring to the laptop itself becoming a source of distraction aka causing them to lose attention. In the beginning I used to worry about but after a while I told myself that at some point I got to trust my students to do the right thing. Which is to take notes and not use the computer for something else.,2017-08-20T15:54:01.703,2605

7126,3265,2,What does this answer add to [this other answer about using the command line instead of a GUI and mentioning online git resources such as GitHub GitLab BitBucket etc.](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/2912/58)?,2017-08-20T18:47:46.743,58
7128,2910,0,Can you expand on _why_ this tutorial is better than any other? Without any explanation this is a link only answer which would be useless if the link dies.,2017-08-20T20:09:59.123,58
7129,3267,1,Likely yes.  A generic web search turns up tons of sites/pages with tutorials on programming a Pi in ARM ASM.,2017-08-20T20:40:54.673,59
7130,3260,0,The 6502 ISA although nice for hand coding is not the best instruction set target for a modern compiler.  The most popular compilers (UCSD Pascal and others) for 6502 PCs targeted an interpreted P-code instead.,2017-08-20T21:22:36.473,59
7132,3259,0,z80 is not very clean is has a lot of special purposes register like the x86 so you can spend a lot of instructions just moving data from register to register. 6502 and Arm are nice so also is this old CPU MC68000.,2017-08-20T23:22:49.593,204
7134,3260,0,_@hotpaw2 I can't find that information anywhere.  Where are you seeing that?  And also what p-code was used?  Presumably the p-code would be a better match then if one were to take this path.,2017-08-21T02:28:02.630,27
7135,3270,1,Would a practical masters be looked at in a positive light or basically as a waste of time?,2017-08-21T02:31:29.507,27
7136,3270,1,Well no rigorous program in something you're interested in studying is a waste of time. Whether it will help for PhD admission probably depends on how prestigious his undergraduate degree is. (Most people apply to PhD programs with only an undergraduate degree.) Someone could come out of this program with a strong recommendation from a Georgia Tech professor.,2017-08-21T02:41:30.460,283
7137,3271,2,Cargo-cultist made me chuckle :)  Welcome to [cseducators.se]!  I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-08-21T03:27:17.393,27

7139,3265,0,I read through all the answers and realised that what helped me 2 years ago the simple stuff wasn't there. I have used this technique in live training sessions and it has helped hundreds of students.   When it comes to training and learning things I believe that there is one right method. there are many methods and the more the merrier. The post is about making GIT easy. I shared what made it easy for my students :),2017-08-21T04:01:11.457,2605
7140,401,0,this is pretty much what I do to. I have a bunch of repositories of the many many projects I have worked and then I show them how 'clean' and hence appealing it looks (similar to how you have compared above).   Some students seem to like it while others ignore. I cannot do anything about those who ignored but those who liked the 'clean' look I find they end up adopting the best practices.,2017-08-21T04:14:03.620,2605
7141,3265,0,(not able to edit my comment so posting this here) in the above comment 'I believe that there is one right method'.   I meant I believe that there is no one right method :),2017-08-21T05:31:50.380,2605
7143,3265,0,Yes it's great that you are willing to share your experiance but you still havn't explained how your experiance is any different from the other answer I linked.,2017-08-21T11:14:02.153,58
7144,3265,0,I am sorry man but I really have nothing else to add. I thought this forum was about sharing experiences. I checked all the other answers. I believe things can be a little more succinct. If my answer is so bad (or spam accidentally) I am sure it should and will get down voted into oblivion and I will be schooled.   However after your comments I ran this page and all the answers including mine with my own students. So I will stick with my answer and I do believe it adds some value to the discussion here.,2017-08-21T11:43:19.817,2605
7146,3265,0,Let's continue this conversation [in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/64170/discussion-on-answer-by-jay-how-to-make-git-easy-to-learn).,2017-08-21T11:56:28.800,58
7148,3273,1,Note this is an education question it is not a computer-science-education question. But I still like it (I am not saying it should be closed).  Just because we use a computer for something does not make it more computer science. ?€?Computer science is about computers in the same why that astronomy is about telescopes or poetry is about pens.?€?,2017-08-21T13:03:39.460,204
7149,3268,2,+1 for a list of good queries. I didn't know about half of these (I certainly had never heard of a linter before now) so this is now my go-to post when self-learning - thank you.,2017-08-21T13:05:38.263,2613
7150,3268,0,As a further suggestion - I also recommend having at least one or two code beautifiers for the language you're learning especially if they can help show where a block of code isn't especially intelligible (both to help anyone proof-reading your code or even future you when reading back over something you wrote before).,2017-08-21T13:07:57.007,2613
7152,3270,0,I'm thinking that this is much more applicable to someone who wants to work in industry rather than develop an academic career. Not that it would be a waste of time but it would cost time that might be better spent.,2017-08-21T13:29:19.147,1293
7153,3273,1,just to add some clarity. You would be surprised how many 'computer classes' are conducted where I live without actual computers. If it wasn't actually very sad I would actually laugh about it. At least where I live the only place where I can assume that my students will have access to computers and internet (and hence ebooks are a feasible option) are only in a computer class.,2017-08-21T15:10:11.670,2605
7154,3277,3,This is a great question!,2017-08-21T15:40:33.370,27
7155,3279,5,Welcome to [cseducators.se] Mr. Tower!  We're always glad to have another teacher join our community. =) Could you describe a bit more about thonny?  Ideal answers on this site have a little more information than you've provided here.,2017-08-21T15:45:10.647,27
7156,3268,1,+1 for Code Review which exists specifically for experienced developers to help improve code.,2017-08-21T17:57:13.097,659
7157,3273,0,You can study astronomy without a telescope and poetry with out a pen. see [cs unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/). It is often better that way.,2017-08-21T18:56:33.553,204
7160,3273,0,I tell my students: whichever you learn best from (or whichever is more affordable).,2017-08-21T22:19:24.440,283
7162,3277,0,_@nocomprende Oh yes I did this once or twice. It is awesome. Why not post it as an answer? Also an active board can be useful too in a similar but extended way.,2017-08-21T22:55:51.700,51
7164,3273,0,If there is one thing I learnt about people (at least where I live) affordability always has the highest priority even for the rich kids. I don't know why that is (may be it is a cultural thing here) but I am leaning towards e-books as more and more thoughts pour in here.,2017-08-22T03:43:09.863,2605
7165,3274,1,To add some clarity the folks (students) I interact will rarely if ever dig deeper into computer historical books. At best they are looking at a book to be used for the duration of the training course and then may be use that book till they get a job (or a promotion if they already have the job). Then they might end up using the book as a reference during their job.,2017-08-22T03:45:05.207,2605
7166,3276,0,With respect to specifically about DRM I have made my peace with that. For instance all of my games are on Steam and sure if Steam some day dies I will be in trouble. Same goes to the hundreds of dollars I have poured on apps from the App Store. I think at this point in my life (and by extension any advice I give to my students) will implore them to accept that DRM is part of their lives too.,2017-08-22T03:47:19.560,2605
7167,3273,1,its true about the astronomy without telescope thing. I am agreeing with you on that. My question is more for a target audience that is willing (rather insisting) to buy the telescope and I am just trying to figure out if they want a real telescope or a virtual on. I did not have to deal with the real or virtual a year ago but now I do. Hence the dilemma.,2017-08-22T03:50:40.553,2605
7168,179,1,for me the issue is it does not scale well. As in after learning BASIC students find it difficult to relate with currently popular languages like Java and C sharp which they eventually have to learn as it is.,2017-08-22T04:13:26.067,2605
7169,3277,1,As a student here's what works for me: Have a full section of the code on your slides (like you get in a book). Do not show the code in an editor (it's distracting). Avoid making changes to the code quickly (over your slides) instead discuss what change you're going to make and have it clearly marked when it happens. Before you even get to big sections of code discuss what it's going to do introduce new syntax in isolation and have diagrams of algorithms (if relevant). Don't expect code you show to be understood well - if you want that have students write something similar as an exercise.,2017-08-22T07:55:19.570,2623

7178,1500,0,I think as educators we have a certain duty (because we can almost predict where someone is going with what they are doing) to tell that they might be unfit with this. guidance counsellors simply cannot make a case like educators (who have more interaction time with students) do.,2017-08-22T16:01:38.270,2605

7210,222,2,_@nocomprende I just realised that the 11hour is like an octave. An octave is named because depending how you count there is ether 7 or 12 notes in an octave. The 2 biggest cases of error are null references not validating inputs and out by one errors.,2017-08-23T14:00:41.890,204

7218,1231,0,Python is widely considered as a best first language. Also XKCD has much more relevant cartoons with explanations like https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1425:_Tasks and https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength,2017-08-23T16:37:20.103,1480

7224,3240,1,Never ever ever feel like using Google/Stack Overflow is cheating. It isn't or if it is cheat away. - this is an excellent advice. For some reason a lot of students feel that they should 'everything' on their own. It takes a huge cultural change to make folks understand that copying blatantly and avoiding reinventing the wheel is not the same thing.,2017-08-24T03:37:22.160,2605
7225,3313,1,I like this metaphor I will use it in class. Except I do not like to blame the user. This is like blaming it on pilot error. Air crash investigators (we can learn a lot from them) have come to realise that it is rarely pilot error: pilots make mistakes in air-craft that have design faults in the user interaction design. Therefore if we design your computer systems better then we can almost eliminate user error and therefore eliminate virus infection.,2017-08-24T09:26:15.423,204
7226,3313,0,How do you know if someone is a vampire? see my view on **what is a virus scanner?** I think I will combine this answer and my answer when teaching next.,2017-08-24T09:29:31.573,204
7227,3313,1,glad you like the metaphor. Of course I take some liberties (like assuming the user is to blame) but I am going with anecdotal evidence. As long as the kids get the point I am putting across I am happy :),2017-08-24T09:47:08.573,2605
7229,3208,0,You may need to define gaps. He doesn't know about the latest technologies ? Same for me and I don't care. If you're thinking gaps in term of basic programming knowledge then what is that basic programming knowledge ?  Define it and you know what to test people against to.,2017-08-24T10:03:03.483,1375
7231,3260,0,The BBC micro has A version of basic with an integrated assembler. This may make it useful for some classes as a stand alone machine. With all of these old machines check for display screen comparability.,2017-08-24T10:51:19.387,204
7234,3208,1,_@Walfrat -- ok I'll define a gap as a lack of awareness of some specific topic relevant to what the student is interested in. The topic could be big or small. For example not being aware of the existence of data structures like lists or hashmaps is a gap. If the student is doing some data analysis in Python not knowing about libraries like pandas or numpy is a gap. If the student is making a web page with complex layout not being aware of the box model (and things like flexbox) is a gap. If the student is writing JS not knowing how the 'this' keyword is scoped is a gap.,2017-08-24T15:04:57.227,732
7239,3317,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Whilst this may theoretically answer the question [it would be preferable](//stackoverflow.meta.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.,2017-08-24T18:42:25.497,150
7248,3063,0,A metaphor is by definition not a literal representation of the concept. That's why it will be very difficult to find a metaphor that explains everything perfectly. That being said I do like the virus metaphor because it can help us focus on teaching students better computing hygiene. When germ theory first became an accepted part of science it still took us multiple generations to get people to make health hygiene or food hygiene a daily part of their daily routine and even today it's something that we must constantly educate and remind people/workers about.,2017-08-25T00:25:23.743,1195
7249,3063,0,Also putting the burden on the student to protect himself is key here. Because that student won't always be using computers in a controlled and well-protected computer lab environment. He won't always have knowledgeable staff that he can call upon. At some point he will be purchasing and using his own computer and other electronics. And/or at some point he may also start using internet cafes in sketchy areas.,2017-08-25T01:22:15.390,1195
7253,3063,0,_@StephanBranczyk yes at some point the student will be purchasing their own computer so we need to teach them about systems that will minimise pilot error (see comment in section on vampires bellow). In the UK/EU up to the early 1970s we used to teach don't fall into the spinning blades. After this time we started teaching about machine guards and hazard protective equipment. It seems we are still catching up in our teaching of computing.,2017-08-25T10:32:26.617,204
7255,3323,0,I don't have enough insight here for a full answer but I think a valuable lesson is the danger of relying on Excel models built by amateurs for serious financial analysis. Buggy VBA can kill you. There are some horror stories around I'm sure.,2017-08-25T12:58:44.760,1293
7256,3323,0,_@Buffy Oh yeah I have heard some of those stories during my travels. Luckily VBA is mostly used for automating mundane tasks in big corporations.,2017-08-25T13:03:42.277,51
7257,3268,0,Well the first part of your post is what I answered to you about how to fill gaps  when they're localized by opposition to wider concept. I feel like I didn't add anything meaningfull now xD.,2017-08-25T13:59:55.777,1375
7258,3297,1,I'm using the second point as the *base* for grading first-year computer science students. In the setting I usually teach students prepare their solutions as a homework so it's all too easy for them to just find a solution on the web; so they don't get a grade for just providing a solution that works. Most of their grade comes from implementing small modifications to their code (e.g. Please change the order from ascending to descending for an assignment on sorting) and bonus points for code clarity (if they can explain why; typical question is: why is this identifier named this way?).,2017-08-25T14:13:18.223,2695
7262,3325,1,Hi ysalmon! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a very well organized question. We hope you'll stick around and maybe say Hi [in our chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom).,2017-08-25T15:24:26.487,58
7266,3326,0,Thanks. I think the idea around the poem rather confusing; maybe it is because I do not know it (I doubt my students would) and cannot find of a well known equivalent in French. Your other suggestions correspond to what I am teaching presently (see question 1.3 [there](https://pro.yannsalmon.fr/_media/forums/td-chaines.pdf)). I too remarked that students tend to confuse a file with its name; I will try to see if x/x confusions arise more in this context. Could you point me to your essay? I could not find it by browsing your profile.,2017-08-25T18:53:57.210,2574
7267,3064,0,_@nocomprende ?€?Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it poorly.?€?,2017-08-25T19:01:44.620,204
7268,3326,0,In English we can relate quoted string literals to what they learn in literacy class ( see call this English Language class). In French I thing you quote ??Like this??. I also note that in you text you have used ?€? in place of . This may (or may not) lead to confusion.,2017-08-25T19:36:28.560,204
7269,3326,0,_@ysalmon. See https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/q/276/1293,2017-08-25T19:41:29.343,1293
7273,3308,2,_@drewbenn - even if that was the case id adds no value to someone's education to be forced to present his work in front of audience. And no despite many claims of the opposite you don't really do that when working as a programmer.,2017-08-25T20:54:44.277,1145
7276,3297,1,I got a very clear example of #1 back when I was a lab assistant.  This was in the era of floppy disks on single drive machines  backup meant a lot of swapping.  The idiotic backup routine couldn't sense the wrong disk in the drive and someone not paying attention could easily copy the target directory over the source--deleting everything.  I knew how to rebuild them and thus got a fair number of students crying for help.  (Continued),2017-08-25T21:06:07.893,668
7278,3297,1,Everyone would freak when I sat them down in front of a binary dump of their data and asked them to identify it but after a bit of paging through it they would start recognizing pieces and I would build up the map I needed.  One gal absolutely couldn't get it.  Somehow it wasn't a surprise when later I found out she had copied everything.,2017-08-25T21:12:06.463,668
7279,3319,5,I'm also an engineer and not an instructor but I'd be concerned about using specific homework assignments as a basis for an exam. If you have a student who struggled with the homework assignment then they're already at a large disadvantage for the exam. Exam questions should probably stand on their own and the students are either able to answer them or unable to answer them. Instead of using the student's homework simply provide your own program code instead.,2017-08-25T21:29:30.800,2707
7280,3220,0,I'd reconsider your stance on video games but actually narrow it down as well. I'd argue that people who are interested in *game optimization* would be an indicator. Playing Candy Crush probably won't do it. But a player who's really interested in optimizing their character in the latest MMORPG? Interests in speed running might also be good since that also explores the limits of the game engine including potential bugs/exploits. Someone who's really interested in exploring the limits of the game rules of that video game is akin to your board game/roleplaying game analogy I would think.,2017-08-25T21:52:48.220,2707
7285,3235,0,_@Oleg I believe that your answer is relevant. If such an opportunity presents itself working on a large project for a company (even if it is pastime) for some time (if not an entire year) is useful. I have just upvoted your answer because I agree with your views. It might work for some self learned students and actually encourage them to self learn even more.,2017-08-26T06:33:36.813,2605
7290,3337,1,What...why is there a down vote? Every answer in this entire page is putting a lamp on the wall sharing valid views but nobody is making a definitive statement. I collated everything and put them in one place and made it definitive so it could help others who are facing a dilemma like mine. You do know I stand to gain nothing by marking my own answer right?,2017-08-26T09:47:33.030,2605
7291,3278,0,Ah! I like this suggestion. It should be very useful to my own methods.,2017-08-26T09:55:07.810,2605

7300,3337,0,I didn't downvote this but I would *guess* that it got downvoted because most of the reasons in your answer have already been stated in the other answers so someone probably didn't see this answer as adding much value. If there were any additional things you considered that weren't raised in other answers you should add them or emphasise them to make your answer more applicable to others. Hope this helps or at least gives you an idea how you might improve your answer further.,2017-08-26T12:11:47.693,2
7301,3330,2,While this is an interesting question it doesn't seem to be about teaching. Fixing the question asking flow for new users has been the topic of many discussions on meta stack overflow and that's where questions about stack overflow belong.,2017-08-26T12:22:57.833,58
7302,3330,12,_@thesecretmaster Seems to be about teaching to me. This would not be on-topic on Meta Stack Overflow because it's not about Stack Overflow *policies* as such more about how a teacher can introduce the usage of a certain resource (Stack Overflow) in order to help students learn. It would seem clearly on-topic if the question was How to more efficiently teach using Wikipedia/a book/insert other resource? so I feel it's also on-topic if about Stack Overflow.,2017-08-26T12:29:12.607,2
7303,3337,1,Thats precisely my point. Others have pointed but each answer is okay you can do that but you can also do this. I was hoping that someone would say right you should do this because of this. It's like should I take the bus or the train (please tell) and every answer is like you should take the bus and also the train. and I am still stuck with the question :P you see what I mean :) so I decided to end the discussions and just close it of with what I eventually decided to do.,2017-08-26T12:56:29.913,2605
7305,3337,1,_@Jay But that's called an XY problem. You already have your solution. If you ask why is this a good solution you'll get opinionated answers.,2017-08-26T14:10:46.787,150
7312,3337,2,This doesn't appear to be an answer. It's a reply to the existing answers. This question will not be closed because that would make new answers impossible. The way to say that you've chosen a particular answer is by accepting it.,2017-08-26T14:57:09.797,58
7313,3337,1,I didn't downvote your answer but I didn't find your answer to be definitive (at least not in the second sense of the word). https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/definitive Also I think you omitted some key points that were alluded to in the other answers my favorite two points being the searchability of e-books (especially if your students use file sharing and the OCR of the scans wasn't done at all or wasn't done properly) and also the distractable nature of having your materials stored on a laptop or a tablet since most students tablets unlike yours are loaded with distractions,2017-08-26T15:53:52.860,1195
7314,3353,0,What you are likely to miss however is the opportunity to interact personally with other educators and develop lasting relationships that benefit your teaching and your career.,2017-08-26T16:15:10.830,1293
7315,3337,1,Which brings me to my next point my comment ran out of space so I couldn't do it there and nor should you really do this in comments but if you're going to incorporate people's suggestions into your own definitive and comprehensive answer and place the limelight on you even if it wasn't your intent it's nice to attribute and credit the people by name who answered your question and first mentioned those particular ideas you found the most compelling.,2017-08-26T16:15:26.493,1195
7316,3353,0,Well I can see what you mean but Dr. Chuck does interact with other educators through the forums and you can also communicate with other students many of whom also work in education.... It's just not f2f in this case.  It would also be possible to find others there and join or start a LinkedIn group arrange Skype calls with screenshares or even set up a group on Google/Live to share notes resources etc. :),2017-08-26T16:21:11.107,2706
7317,3337,1,It also should be noted that StackExchange/StackOverflow doesn't really like to have short definitive answers to subjective questions because such answers are likely to attract people who disagree with them and then launch into long-winded debates about them (with no clear way to stop such debates). This is why you'll often see questions that start with What is the best... What is your favorite... immediately put on hold for being too opinion-based/too subjective/too broad/too difficult. See https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/,2017-08-26T16:25:05.513,1195
7318,3353,0,There is something marvelous however when you go to meet and interact with people IRL and learn (a) you are just as smart/good as anyone and (b) you have a lot to contribute yourself. Much harder to get that with computer mediated communication. Bandwidth matters.,2017-08-26T16:27:37.257,1293
7319,3235,0,_@Jay Thanks wasn't expecting any upvotes on this one ;). I do think it might be useful to someone and this is why I left it. It's generally relevant to people who want to learn programming but strictly in the StackOverflow sense of answering the question it's not really relevant.,2017-08-26T17:24:37.740,2149

7322,3330,2,Interesting. As a student I've never been taught how to use SO or any other community for that matter. But I think this question is really interesting in the broader sense of How to more efficiently teach students how to ask good questions? which is a quite wider ability. Also considering that SO is not about computer science but only about programming.,2017-08-26T19:50:43.273,963
7323,3339,0,If you can define 'worth asking' this question would be better. I'd hope you remember the difference between 50 LOC and 50k though...,2017-08-26T20:30:25.503,41
7324,3339,0,Was she asking them to come up with a figure from memory or did they have a computer with the source code in front of them?,2017-08-26T20:34:14.707,124
7325,3308,1,_@drewbenn - unfortunately cs academics drown out actual people from the industry here so the answers you get are the same nonsense you get in the academic setting in the first place. Democracy has severe downsides.,2017-08-26T20:54:14.820,1145
7326,3330,3,Be aware that some CS academic settings don't put any focus on specific tools (debugger stack overflow visual studio etc). Those are too subject to change over time. Perhaps consider what your course is about and if something like this should be taught. I would only imagine this being appropriate if it were a VERY general CS class and even then the subject should be about asking technical questions certainly not using SO.,2017-08-26T21:14:45.560,2719
7329,3352,0,regex can be readable. If you break them up. Lots of separate bits that you join together. E.g. `LetterOrUnderscore+LetterOrUnderscoreOrNumber+*`,2017-08-26T22:11:16.310,204
7331,3339,0,_@Gilles She was asking them to answer it precisely to the .. say 673 lines of code and they had a computer with source code in it but this question was asked during project evaluation. Her question was normally: Now come to the code.. Wait a minute! Before opening it tell me how many lines does it have? and introspection began,2017-08-26T22:50:19.290,2537
7332,3335,8,Adding to issue #5 (recommendation #4) - [How to debug small programs](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/) is absolutely essential. If a student (or anyone) can't explain precisely what part isn't working then they're not ready to ask on SO.,2017-08-26T23:02:29.737,1400
7333,3308,0,_@davor Learning to present your ideas is an important skill. This often brings interesting discussion of design for programs that is both productive and useful.  NCSSM has a nice environment; kids do not have anything to fear going in front of their peers. They are used to this.,2017-08-27T01:04:12.173,21
7334,3337,0,It also should be noted that StackExchange/StackOverflow doesn't really like to have short definitive answers ah...you see there you go...there are mechanics about stack that I am still getting used to :) I acknowledge that this answer (with all its down votes) is a learning experience for me about what I can or cannot do :) Next time I know what to avoid. thanks for the insightful feedback guys (although I must admit the dictionary link was kind of a low blow...did not expect that :P ),2017-08-27T06:28:09.010,2605
7335,3235,0,precisely Oleg. The whole self-learning thing is huge and when there are lack of resources and guidance (like how it is in my city) self learning is the only way to learn anything. The base question is why would you self learn? So you can get a better career a hike or more money or better opportunity. At the end of the day I approach the profession of teaching as way to ensure livelihood to my students more than anything else. From that angle your answer makes practical sense to me.,2017-08-27T06:35:33.687,2605
7336,3360,0,I guess asking the right questions is the right approach for life in general but I don't know if that is what is being discussed here. Your answer is neither here nor there and it does not even touch the topic at hand :(,2017-08-27T06:39:35.817,2605
7337,3360,1,Well to teach stack overflow isn't a useful goal. To teach people to ask better questions and their steps is. That it so happens that it makes for better questions and the occasional rubber duckery is the point I'm trying to make here. Even if god forbid SE goes away these are skills that carry over anywhere,2017-08-27T06:41:36.300,2722
7338,3360,0,I agree with your point. we are both on the same page there. Its just not relevant to this question. If there is another question (or you could create one) that says 'How to teach asking the right questions' then your answer would be right there in the sweet spot.,2017-08-27T06:43:21.993,2605
7339,3360,0,But the way to use SE efficiently *is* to ask the right questions and use answers to sharpen one's skills in solving problems. That's how I've benefited from it over time,2017-08-27T06:44:09.887,2722
7340,3360,0,Ha..ha...okay okay live and let live is my policy :P your thoughts might help others because you know opinions and views is what we want in this community. I may not agree with the answer being relevant but I respect your contribution.,2017-08-27T06:46:38.147,2605
7343,3213,0,Excellent way of doing this. for me if a kid is really interested I want to know that he can be autonomous with minimal guidance. That is how I did it and that is probably what I am looking for when I run into such kids.,2017-08-27T07:18:33.073,2605
7344,740,0,One reason I like Unity is because its everywhere. students love it when they can see what they build and quickly share it with their friends. Unity should be the go to option for anything to do with game teaching.,2017-08-27T07:20:27.667,2605
7345,3363,0,I don't quite get it. How is this flagged as a broad question? Its a very specific scenario I am facing and this is something that happens to almost every department and every faculty. I even narrowed down the solutions so it will be easier for folks to help me out. I cannot get any more specific than that. I am an educator and this is a real challenge I am facing. Some careers are literally at stake here and a wrong call from me will have long term consequences. Hence the question.,2017-08-27T07:59:16.747,2605
7346,3335,2,The link to BInary debugging really uses some annoying ad practices popping up random screens while you're reading the text,2017-08-27T08:59:08.353,1639
7348,3308,0,_@ncmathsadist - brushing your teeth is also an important skill but it still doesn't belong in CS curriculum.,2017-08-27T09:44:10.520,1145
7349,3364,0,At this point they are pretty much independent of passion. Its like they are adrift at sea. They are not asking for pizza anymore but just drinking water. So passion no passion they got to do it because the clock is ticking for them (their words not mine).,2017-08-27T10:14:44.917,2605
7354,3364,0,Talk to them find out what they could get passion for. There is some rely cool stuff that they could learn. I like Gnu/Linux I learnt it in 1991 it is still current and not-waiting for the others to catch up. It is like there has been no real advancement in software since the 1960s.,2017-08-27T11:41:04.437,204
7355,3365,2,You could find a real Free Software / Open Source project to contribute to.,2017-08-27T11:43:02.973,204
7356,3076,0,Since my lost comment on this I heard a talk by a women that has her Phd + in electronic voting systems she has several **mathematical proofs** that they can not do what they need to do. One of her colleges invited a group of ?€?young people?€? to hack some real voting machines (manufacturers claimed 100% secure and trustworthy)  in a 1 or 2 week session. She was sceptical that there would be time to find any thing. First exploit found in two minutes. All compromised by end of exercise. Could be that all current systems are made by cowboys. But see proofs or linked video for general case.,2017-08-27T12:13:45.850,204
7357,3363,1,I would suggest to change its title - it feels from homepage that this question is about latecomers in class.,2017-08-27T12:26:52.930,2537
7358,3367,0,I have already narrowed it down. there is no time to sit and discuss with them what they are passionate or what they want in life or any of that. Like I have said above folks who are essentially looking up to me to take the call. So the above answer won't really help me. I want to know which of the above or something similar I can do with them. We must assume here that the students will essentially listen to whatever I decide for them. Their input is essentially nil here. Hence the title Late Comers.,2017-08-27T12:30:15.580,2605
7359,3364,1,Passion may no longer matter to them but I have scheduled a discussion with them in exactly a week from. I am looking to gather as many views/thoughts/opinions as I can here and see where that takes me.,2017-08-27T12:31:29.073,2605
7360,3367,0,_@Jay Thanks! I think my answer is invalid in this context then.,2017-08-27T12:32:42.160,2537
7361,3363,0,I cannot think of anything better than that. They are late to their 'career preparation' is what I am trying to imply. If someone can suggest a better title (or better yet edit it in) that would be great.,2017-08-27T12:35:06.823,2605
7362,3363,0,Yeah I am also looking forward to that - I am sure there must be some better title for that.,2017-08-27T12:36:05.963,2537
7363,3367,1,Its not invalid (you will notice that I haven't flagged or down voted it) but more like I liked the last part but not the rest (so may be you can edit your answer to be more specific). You are right. I will see about taking them through a OOP crash course and SQL with a practical project.,2017-08-27T12:37:01.063,2605
7364,3365,1,I was thinking of making them work solo but a team project might be better...good I will keep that in mind. These students stay together anyway...I did not factor the significance of that.,2017-08-27T12:38:56.110,2605
7366,3330,4,Please don't just teach them how to use SO effectively - teach them in general about [the smart way of asking questions](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and [how to write the perfect question](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/). This art is applicable to any other platform as well.,2017-08-27T13:27:02.533,660
7367,3363,0,I think you need to ask for a 'Curriculum structure for basic single year course' or something similar. The tags are also all wrong this should be about your course not the students.I also wonder if you are asking for confirmation of your plan rather than presenting all of your constraints.,2017-08-27T13:52:52.607,41
7368,3363,0,I already have a basic single year course in place. This is not about that. Obviously I have a plan. However I wish to consult the experts and see what additions I can make and what I can delete. There are many times where I am hopelessly wrong so I prefer to consult before finalising the plan.,2017-08-27T14:39:21.807,2605
7369,3368,0,Do you actually use a textbook lock step with the instruction - No is it a reference to be used by the student as needed Yes. or is it an alternate source that might present the material in a manner that differs from the instructor so as to provide another option if the student is having trouble? No.,2017-08-27T14:41:06.147,2605
7370,3361,0,If I did that I'd feel like I was abdicating my responsibility to those students. My students weren't in my class to prove to me that they didn't need to be there. Perhaps you can organize things so that you provide a variety of challenges so that they don't get away without expanding their knowledge not just showing it off.,2017-08-27T15:07:54.660,1293
7371,3335,0,_@Ferrybig -- oh does it? (I use adblock so can't really tell). If you (or anybody else) can find an alternate link I'm happy to replace it.,2017-08-27T15:26:09.847,732
7372,3361,0,Well I have been running a tech club in my city for the last 5 years. These students end up joining my club where I fund their software projects I go to the extent of buying them expensive computing hardware providing them much needed textbooks and broadband connectivity. All out of my pocket. I only let them out of the lab but not out of my guidance. If anything I have gone above and beyond my responsibility as a faculty spending thousands of dollars out of my pocket so they can do things.,2017-08-27T17:06:45.343,2605
7374,3363,4,So if I understand it right that college offers a 4 year CS course that does not end up with anything making employment likely? Could you add more details on how that can be (age course content...)? Frankly as someone reviewing applications on a regular basis I don't even look so much at their study related things; I look for items that show their *interest* in the subject. People who are really into it usually find ways to express that (side projects hacking stuff together in the basement coding something cool etc.). But it has to come from themselves not from yet another teacher...,2017-08-27T23:20:39.140,652
7375,3334,0,I'd be interested in hearing which formal new-user restrictions you find most constraining. Or if not a formal restriction what cultural artifact. Some thought was put into the question of *How can we protect the network without preventing new users from using it?* and your feeling seems to be that the resulting rules are failing to meet that goal.,2017-08-28T00:13:23.370,2735
7376,3371,0,Disclaimer: I am not associated with the institute whose OCW I used as an example above. It was purely intended to share it with fellow CS educators.,2017-08-28T01:15:21.490,2537
7378,3363,1,That is the real challenge here. These students (and by extension many - and there are many more from where they come from) did not show any interest. Now a sudden realisation that they will soon be out of their homes and branded 'unemployed' is forcing them to take drastic measures. Its tragic but I have seen this happen every year.,2017-08-28T03:02:50.847,2605
7379,3334,0,The part about upvoting and the commenting was severely restricting. I remember a year ago when I joined stack I left because of that only to return 2 weeks ago. Even then I was frustrated with the restrictions. Especially on stack where earning reputation is insanely difficult these two things can be demotivating.,2017-08-28T03:20:01.397,2605
7380,3374,5,Welcome to  Computer Science Educators. This is an interesting question. Hope to see you around here more.,2017-08-28T08:25:05.350,204
7381,3377,0,In my opinion using the same software on every system is not really a sole advantage of text editors as most IDEs also support multiple operating systems. Is it possible that I've misunderstood this formulation?,2017-08-28T09:01:25.733,793
7382,3376,0,I agree. I find C# even easier than Python,2017-08-28T09:12:13.913,2537
7384,3378,2,A good answer  I would add auto-correct should be considers harmful. Though spell check and error highlighting are not. Also my text editor has revision control.,2017-08-28T09:44:47.007,204
7385,3376,0,the new kids they don't find dot net easy at all. You and I (given how many years we have been in this work) may do. The young ones they just don't man. I don't know why. And yeah little knowledge is dangerous but none is disastrous.,2017-08-28T10:06:42.920,2605
7391,3374,1,This seems like a duplicate of [this question](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/44/58). Can you explain the difference to me?,2017-08-28T12:01:35.793,58
7395,3374,2,_@thesecretmaster That question is about teaching HTML to 11-13 year-olds whereas this is a question about a course on the university level. It is reasonable to assume that more cognitive load is managable for university students than children making the question about editor+terminal vs. IDE more relevant. Furthermore HTML requires only an editor whereas programming includes using the terminal to actually run the programs.,2017-08-28T12:21:54.643,2741
7406,453,2,More specifically the answer is it's a tool and like others it does not fits everywhere,2017-08-28T13:22:19.267,1375
7408,654,0,I have to conditionally agree with this based on the professor. One exam that I wrote on paper (about 60% code) was judged by whether the code ran when put it into an editor verbatim. Things like a simple variable name typo would cause students to get quite literally a 0 on the question. As expected that class had approx. 60% failure rate. If a professor is going to be this strict about marking I definitely believe not even necessarily an IDE but at least a text editor should be considered. The exam when I retook the course was on a text editor and it was significantly less stressful.,2017-08-28T14:24:20.487,2755
7411,3319,0,_@Ellesedil It's true that students could be punished twice for doing a bad job on homework. I would mitigate that by not making too much depend on any one piece of homework or test question. Also you could communicate how you test ahead of time and have office hours or class time set aside for improving homework even after it has been turned in which would improve the code for the exam but not for the original homework grade. Generally I think the issue can be managed/mitigated. Using your own code would be ok sometimes but doesn't incent students to create readable maintainable code.,2017-08-28T14:40:54.877,2682
7416,3378,0,Do you count the idle IDE as a heavyweight solution ?,2017-08-28T17:16:02.607,2103
7417,3377,2,_@TuringTux I think it's a matter of degree rather than of absolutes.  Some IDEs eg Eclipse are widely available on many platforms; others eg Visual Studio are single platform.   Even then Eclipse isn't as widely available as emacs or vi; I suspect the same would be true for eclipse vs Sublimesque text editors as well; if not individually then as an entire product class.,2017-08-28T17:39:32.983,1411
7420,3378,2,_@MichelBillaud Good question - I think I don't. As far as I can remember IDLE comes bundled with Python (so from the space point of view it's like the OS-builtin editor) and starts pretty fast so it seems lightweight to me (at least judging by my quite subjective criteria).,2017-08-28T17:53:14.293,793
7430,3374,1,Each student is different and each will have vastly different needs from such a personal tool. Why not give them positive arguments for both things and let them individually choose what to use? Python was taught at my university for first years and some of us used VIM some used PyCharm and some used GEDIT.,2017-08-28T19:43:38.430,2774
7432,3378,2,I don't think that consume a lot of disk space and memory is really worth the consideration these days. PyCharm right now needs less memory than some single chrome tabs and requires about 500MB of disk space - both negligible even for the weakest notebooks. There are lots of other arguments that should imo be more front and center than that.,2017-08-28T20:06:00.407,819
7436,3326,0,At step 4. The white knight should simply have started singing after he said The song _is_.,2017-08-28T21:34:05.180,1269
7438,3365,2,My university actually required students to take a course that fits your description to a T before they were allowed to get their CS degrees. Perhaps the OP's school already offers such a class? If so and if the class is run well the best thing might be for the students to really do their best in that class not to impress the teacher but to get as much out of the experience as they can for themselves.,2017-08-28T22:29:37.263,1360
7443,3363,0,I'm still cringing at They have finished 6 semesters and have a half baked idea and some exposure... However nothing is employment worthy. I'd hope by junior year students would have a strong enough foundation to learn new languages on their own and would have completed at least one large class project.,2017-08-28T23:53:41.727,2045
7445,3385,1,Commercial IDEs are also an option since many provide free licenses to students educators and classrooms (e.g. [Jetbrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html?fromMenu#type=ide)).,2017-08-29T01:15:04.937,1719
7446,3390,1,I am talking about India but the situation is the same. In the last 2 years I have worked on a 4 major projects each of them had a significant web component. I also have a habit of informally walking around the client location and asking people what they are upto. web development skills are in demand if not high paying.,2017-08-29T03:01:09.847,2605
7453,3385,7,I too started with (hand) punched-cards and while I wouldn't suggest going back to that there is a potential danger that a _do-it-all-IDE_ can hide a lot of what's really happening from a new student and produce _cut-and-paste-coders_ that don't _really_ understand what they're doing (and lead to some of the poorer questions on StackOverflow). On the flip side systems libraries and frameworks have got so complex that very few people _could_ every understand everything so a degree of trust the black box is necessary. Perhaps a term of no-frills _programming_ before switching to IDEs.,2017-08-29T06:49:44.610,1372
7455,3392,1,As I comment on [Buffy's answer](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/3385/1372) I think there's a lot to be said for starting at the nuts and bolts level at least for a while to try to give students a solid grounding so they have a better understanding of what the _do-it-all-IDE_ is doing for them. In a similar way to when I did O-level maths and one test-paper was calculator-free (slide-rules/log-tables allowed) to prove you understood the basic concepts involved.,2017-08-29T07:00:58.467,1372
7457,3378,0,_@Voo I think that this depends a little on the machine - on my laptop PyCharm takes considerably more time until it's usable than the standard text editor. From my experience I think this could be relevant for school PCs as I've seen that they are often not the latest and fastest models.,2017-08-29T07:25:42.180,793
7462,3378,1,_@Turing Startup time definitely. But my point is you only start it once and when it's running the amount of resources it needs is hardly worthy the consideration these days. If you spend several hours programming whether the initial setup takes <1 second or 10 seconds is not that relevant.,2017-08-29T08:24:12.147,819
7464,3395,0,Linq is designed to be functional (non-mutating) as is sql. But create delete update are not functional or sql. These are an extension to sql. So you may struggle with them.,2017-08-29T09:32:57.457,204

7480,3390,0,I have a question a bit off topic but for web projects won't you need to have some experience with design?,2017-08-29T12:10:07.027,118
7485,3390,1,_@Safirah it depends on the team. I've worked two different co-ops with some web component and only in one did I specifically need to know basic design concepts. It is possible to be entirely isolated from design in a web project especially if the Back End is a heavy part of the project. But that's another advantage of showing the students the essential web components; it is likely they will naturally gravitate more to design or more to backend but both are employable and have just as much place on a team.,2017-08-29T13:00:59.987,2755
7486,3390,1,you would need experience with design but the design is usually given by someone else or it can be done by someone else. The web development skills in this context would be the interactions and the things that can called and so on.,2017-08-29T13:01:26.257,2605
7498,3402,1,The only problem with you're first idea is that if the majority of the class doesn't want to do the task then you have 2 solutions: 1) You make groups where you put motivated students and let unmotivated students fail or 2) Let them make groups and possibly see the usual 5 people group: 1 working + 4 watching,2017-08-29T14:39:08.923,118
7500,3402,0,But the pair programming idea might do the trick although it must be an assignment done in the classrom I've seen countless pair group assignments where one of them doesn't even know what the first line of code does,2017-08-29T14:42:06.990,118
7501,3402,1,Certainly I would form the groups in a case like this even if I randomize it.  You can also use group peer evaluation to goad the ones tempted to slack. You have incentives you can use. Don't neglect them.,2017-08-29T14:42:10.603,1293
7505,3402,0,I don't want to seem annoying xD but students usually defend each other.,2017-08-29T14:49:23.427,118
7507,3403,0,Hahaha students thinking I'm ditching work is the last of my problems! ;) But your solution is very helpful! And a interesting twist from @RageCage solution,2017-08-29T14:52:40.253,118
7508,3402,0,My answer was updated to give more ideas about how to to about peer evaluation. It is a bit subtle but isn't difficult.,2017-08-29T15:03:38.613,1293
7510,3392,0,At the same time do you really want to bother first year students with things such classpaths (oh god) manually configuring gradle projects and whatnot? So before we start programming you'll now get a 4 hours introduction into technical details that are in the end irrelevant for programming but are required to get started just doesn't sound like a great introduction. In the end even if there's no IDE you'll still give them some basic structure that they won't understand so that they can get to the interesting parts.,2017-08-29T16:22:33.163,819
7511,3392,0,And if you do that anyhow using an IDE doesn't seem particularly problematic from the magic POV. It just depends whether it actually helps or distracts from the actual programming. I certainly would think that developing Python without IDE is a great deal easier than say Java.,2017-08-29T16:23:54.563,819
7521,3401,3,It would be a huge help if students could look over each other's code on projects to help each other out before handing them in. Unfortunately the (very appropriate) culture in schools that treats cheating and plagiarism very strictly makes this difficult to do.,2017-08-29T17:38:24.387,1360
7536,3381,0,;-) I was talking about a function that can deal with _any_ program.,2017-08-29T20:11:16.273,2574
7542,3387,1,I like this answer because is completely true. For beginners I think this hybrids are the best option. I was thinking in Visual Studio Code that actually opens really fast and has a lots of plugins easy to install. Using this you can focus in programming and not in configuration.,2017-08-29T21:29:43.987,2480
7544,3407,1,This is a fair point but there is a counterpoint: someone trained in *always* finding errors in code may change things for the sake of change when on the job.  An even more important ability I would argue is the **ability to recognize flawless code that does not need modification.**,2017-08-29T21:37:40.237,1103
7545,3401,4,Your findings are not unique to students. The workforce is exactly the same way. Some developers believe strongly in code reviews and do a good job while others look at them as yet another task they don't have time for and barely do a review if they do one at all. If you find that silver-bullet that gets everyone excited and motivated to do code reviews then you will be able to leave your teaching job and make a lot of money consulting. IME neither the carrot nor the stick has much impact in changing behavior regarding code reviews one way or the other over the long-run.,2017-08-29T21:52:11.667,2817
7546,3402,2,More of an addendum to this answer (plus I'm new here hello!)  How about introducing unit tests.  Members of pairs must be able to pass their partner's tests as well as their own.  It encourages the collusion and teamwork you seek without looking like you're palming your work off on them.  Those unit tests can also be included in the grading perhaps?,2017-08-29T21:58:12.497,2818
7548,3402,0,Re:But you also learn a lot from what is not said and who is not included in the contributor list.  Like for instance you learn who is friends with who and who is popular versus not popular?  I'd agree that you may be surprised that people say positive things about someone you didn't realize was doing well because many kids are introverted and don't necessarily stand out in the crowd. However their work does stand out when given the chance. Conversely I don't think you can come to the reverse conclusion with any degree of reliability;You may as well flip a coin versus using the reviews.,2017-08-29T22:01:40.677,2817
7557,203,0,Consider what you want them to be able to do at the end of the course as well and use this to guide the content of each section of the course.,2017-08-30T01:35:52.163,2706
7562,3407,0,Fair point but not one in the OP. Also I don't agree. *Any* professional of merit will have received some training in recognising serious faults routine faults and unimportant poor practice - and *also* when a fault matters and when it doesn't from a product perspective. I don't think you can say don't specifically train them to see faults (even in their own or similar work) or they will find fault with everything (which is basically the concern you give).  I don't know any educational or skill training body that would agree.,2017-08-30T10:30:08.243,1629
7564,3381,0,So they cannot do it : the uniform halting problem is not decidable. And that's the point : learning a bit of theory can avoid searching for things that do not exist which should be of interest to them as they are learning CS and not theology.,2017-08-30T13:43:39.440,2574
7569,3398,0,I keep waiting for new answers or suggestions but I guess no cloud folks here :P Would mark answer by default (like win by default) a good practice ctrl?,2017-08-30T13:57:36.107,2605
7572,3418,0,Do you mean 'you teach this as an introduction' or 'you learn from spreadsheets'? I think it will do a small amount of harm - maybe to a minority - if it is used as an introduction.,2017-08-30T14:06:14.693,41
7573,3418,0,I like the above suggestion by Sean. And most editors come with intellisense anyway so almost nobody needs to remember syntax. I am not proud of it but I absolutely remember none of the syntax and I have quite a few enterprise projects under my belt.,2017-08-30T14:07:40.277,2605
7575,3418,0,_@Jay Day one it's not a question of remembering syntax it's all about mapping natural language to the unknown. The problem then with blocks is trying to remember the hierarchy and where the 'loop thing' is hidden. I strongly feel that with this group day one needs to be easy and appear productive.,2017-08-30T14:10:51.657,41
7576,3420,1,I have nothing against spreadsheets (I use them myself at work). Just I don't want first years exposed to it that is all :P I like to keep my classroom fun and nice and spreadsheets are just not that.,2017-08-30T14:12:06.857,2605
7578,3418,1,Ah then I stand corrected. Easy and Productive is my mantra. for myself and others,2017-08-30T14:13:18.797,2605
7580,3414,0,Which OS are you using. If you are using a Unix (UNIX MacOS Gnu/Linux) then (if syllabus allows) it could be a good idea to teach command line. My order of preference for my own usage are: Unix command line Unix GUI (KDE) Microsoft GUI Microsoft command line.,2017-08-30T14:19:33.640,204
7581,3420,0,To use a simple analogy spreadsheets are like that Microsoft guy from the apple ad. Just does not fit into my definition anything remotely fun. Full Disclosure I am a huge MS fan and 80 % of my money comes from dot net but yeah I can be honest and say that most of the time Microsoft is not what I call fun. They have improved over the years but spreadsheets...nope not fun at all.,2017-08-30T14:20:23.923,2605
7586,3422,1,So what is your (ultimate) question?,2017-08-30T14:42:14.780,2537
7593,3422,0,I've never encountered language as a barrier. Culture to a small extent (people unable to admit they are stuck and need help) - but not in me personal experience with people from India. Soft skills help and maybe it depends what level in the market you're addressing but delivery is what matters in the end. Here you're providing an __excuse__ to your students about why even after you trained them they will struggle - and they don't like that.,2017-08-30T15:13:22.623,41
7594,3423,0,This is an awesome suggestion and also a great way to show importance of clear code and good comments,2017-08-30T15:18:29.350,118
7595,3422,0,I've never encountered language as a barrier.  ah...well it is a big deal here. With so much work coming from Europe and US this is a huge one for us and by extension a challenge for every trainer who works in Asia. We have no choice but to deal with it. I have had managers spending hours telling me how they have lost so many deals because of language issues. Its actually very sad.,2017-08-30T15:55:20.007,2605
7596,3424,0,the gentle tirade is putting it mildly. I tend to get dramatic...so there is that. Perhaps I could work on that. offering suggestions I do that...ignoring...thats hard but already doing it..and making it part of curriculum is what I am hoping to do with this question above.,2017-08-30T15:57:22.133,2605
7597,3422,0,The ultimate question is I am trying to figure out a way to convey that and making it part of my curriculum. I am not the only struggle with it either. Many trainers here are and I am always about improving what I am doing...for example G. Ann has posted the kind of stuff I want to read and work on.,2017-08-30T16:01:13.650,2605
7600,3422,0,It sounds like you are more motivated 'for' your students' success than they are. It's more like the big bosses want them to learn because it means more revenue. I simply end up with these scenarios because I am just open to suggestions and take some risks something that other trainers are unwilling to do.,2017-08-30T16:24:08.470,2605
7601,3414,0,Actually I don't see any pros stated in your question. Did you forget to list them. I see the what but not the why.,2017-08-30T17:11:30.873,1293
7607,3334,0,_@nocomprende Hm. Self-answers (well good self-answers to good questions?€?we don't care for astroturfing) are actively encouraged on [physics.se] (my most used site) and they used to be on Stack Overflow when I was active there (admittedly it's been while). I suspect that there is some culture shock at work here. Those of us who joined Stack Overflow in the beta had both guidance from the podcasts and *time* to adjust to a culture still forming.,2017-08-30T17:41:01.197,2735
7610,1497,0,I think the assertion that they may make more money as a plumber is based on the basis that they may not have the aptitude and motivation to make it successfully as a software engineer/developer.  I know of several students that achieved a H.Dip in S/W and have not been able to get a job in the area or if they have have been unable to keep it.,2017-08-30T18:33:30.847,2706
7612,3414,1,_@Buffy; the pros are that the concepts under Relevant topics to explore in the Introduction are introduced i.e. to visualise a variable as a cell location which can be given a name and you can assign a data type use the name in calculations etc.,2017-08-30T18:38:02.200,2706
7613,3414,0,_@ctrl-alt-decor  All the machines use Win7.  I use a Linux laptop myself.  I have considered starting code after the intro with NotePad++ and this could generate Python code that is run from the command line and I have also been thinking about creating scripts in the form of Windows batch files and doing some simple commands for file-sys nav editing/creating/deleting folders and so on...,2017-08-30T18:40:45.597,2706
7614,3414,0,But say why you think those things are pros for this way of teaching. You aren't making a connection (for me at least). You are just listing topics.,2017-08-30T18:47:13.140,1293
7615,3418,1,_@Sean   I've also tried both https://blockly-games.appspot.com/ and Scratch (cloud and DL vers) trinket.io for online storage and execution and pythontutor.com so that you can step through the code and see it visualised in the browser.  I am also teaching a module on Excel this year and it occurred to me that perhaps I could use it as a learning aid for the concepts outlined above before moving on to other approaches.  I'd be interested to know how it may do harm?  If discussing how the SUM function works under the hood it might be a way to introduce the idea of something like a for-loop.,2017-08-30T18:47:49.543,2706
7616,1493,0,It's very unfortunate the number of students on my classrooms that are studying CS because it gives money or my parents told me to. And from my experience (limited to Portuguese some highschools and colleges) this happens with higher frequency on CS courses that anyother one,2017-08-30T18:50:40.847,118
7617,3419,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor  I started bith Blockly (Google) last year and did a few weeks in Scratch to try to demonstrate the basics.  Some said they found it useful some did not.  I am keen to try anything new that helps learners to get it at the beginning before moving on to coding in a text-editor or IDE.,2017-08-30T18:51:02.083,2706
7620,3420,0,Thanks I wasn't even thinking of fun!  I used Scratch last year with mixed results.  I also used Blockly Games.  Maybe I can find a way to make Excel sheets fun :D  It's a good point though!  Fun = engagement => better learning?,2017-08-30T18:54:18.363,2706
7626,3433,1,I like to try different things every year.  Some work and some don't.  This would not be a major part of the course just an introduction before moving on to writing Python code in NotePad++ (and later- in the follow-on module- PyCharm).  For this module they must understand the elements in the intro and be able to create flowcharts modular programming (files and functions imports etc.).  Some may be familiar with Office and some likely will not.,2017-08-30T19:02:54.740,2706
7627,3435,0,A good and wise answer (IMO). Welcome to CSEducators. Hope to hear more from you.,2017-08-30T19:04:23.583,1293
7629,3433,2,Good then. A wise friend of mine has advocated for a long time that a certain part of every course (I think he says 10%) should be experimental. Try something new and evaluate it. But also be prepared to compensate if it goes especially badly. It also makes it less boring if you have to teach the same courses repeatedly.,2017-08-30T19:07:25.647,1293
7631,3432,2,_@Kevin Workman really good point.  Who wants a boring Introduction?  As someone said in another response- we need some fun in there too!  I may demo some of the work of previous years students to show what the end-goal is.  I've read through those links as well- there were some really nice suggestions in each.  Processing looks pretty nice and although I am happily married to Python I am tempted to cheat or even have an affair with Processing.,2017-08-30T19:14:16.797,2706
7632,3432,0,_@srattigan In that case you might look into using [Processing.py](http://py.processing.org/). See [this answer](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/3374/ide-vs-editor-and-terminal-for-cs1/3388#3388) for more info.,2017-08-30T19:16:17.457,2068
7633,3414,1,_@Buffy My rationale is that it introduces these topics in a more familiar and relatively popular application that many may have met before and to use the Excel environment to demonstrate the concepts of variables etc.  When I show the Python Interpreter math expressions will (for the most part) evaluate as they do in Excel.  If I use if/else the syntax will differ but the principle will be the same.  If we were to look at a function to sum a list we have to think about the algorithm that may be used under the hood in Excel and create it in Python.  Similarly for min max etc.,2017-08-30T19:20:09.183,2706
7634,3334,0,_@nocomprende I was active on Stack Overflow until about four years ago when the culture had settled down. But that aside the reason you come to SE and the reason for the SE exists don't need to be the same thing. SE exists to (among other things) make the internet a better place by collecting good answers to good questions. A well constructed self-answer can aid that part of the mission but site cultures vary which can lead to culture shock. That is something that should be addressed but systematically rather than in response to individual events.,2017-08-30T19:30:17.660,2735
7637,3414,0,See my answer here which I just updated to address this issue. If they are well familiar with spreadsheets then it is more natural of course.,2017-08-30T19:35:43.707,1293
7638,3433,1,I never know what the students are going to be like until they start so I'll know next Monday.  It looks like there can be benefits to using Excel: if they have some knowledge of using it vars expression and functions may be grasped more readily.  On the other hand it's not very exciting.  Scratch and Google Blockly are arguably more fun but it was considered useful by about half of last years cohort.  Another new thing to try is batch file scripts... there really are so many options I can use that getting the right balance is difficult.,2017-08-30T19:46:37.333,2706
7641,3421,1,Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/64854/discussion-on-answer-by-talha-irfan-introduction-to-programming-class-use-sprea).,2017-08-30T20:55:17.493,58
7643,330,0,you are correct that there is a plethora of r sources out there. I have suggested some ideas for the how below. Whether this works well for increasing student learning depends on the student imho. If you also set some work that relates to the resources perhaps they are more useful. Is there anything you need expansion on before you could select an acceptable answer?,2017-08-30T21:38:41.080,2706
7650,3422,1,I hope it works out for me :),2017-08-31T05:20:25.367,2605
7651,3439,1,to put some things in context I don't have a job but rather arrangements with various agencies. There is no job to lose because I don't have one. However instead of making 10 dollars I might make 9 (which is still more than what most of my peers make). While there is a monetary loss it is something that is acceptable to me. I feel that if I can figure this out (like say in the next 1 year) it will pay for itself.,2017-08-31T05:23:20.633,2605
7653,3446,1,Azure is broad. No doubt about that. However every one must start somewhere. Like with any programming I want to give them a rundown. For instance the azure dashboard itself is overwhelming for newcomers. However if a simple 3 hour session on creating a web service and connecting to it via FTP and putting some 'just coded' basic html files has worked wonders for me in the past.,2017-08-31T08:34:44.910,2605
7654,3446,0,The first paragraph was a comment and then I realised that I was extending it into a answer. Perhaps I didn't make the point clear enough: the course isn't going to be Azure because that's too big a topic so what is it *really* going to be?,2017-08-31T09:05:52.397,1219
7655,3418,0,_@srattigan Added to the answer. I worry that you will plant some seeds of false understanding confusion or concern unless you start with an above-average familiarity of using spreadsheets across the whole cohort. I was writing database applications when I first encountered spreadsheets and the spreadsheets made little sense to me at the time (35 years ago - so my early experience may match some of your cohort's only exposure).,2017-08-31T09:06:57.027,41
7656,3422,1,_@Jay I do work quite a lot with engineers in Asia (possibly well above average ability I can't judge). Maybe it's better to say the illusion of following process is a far bigger barrier than language in the cases where there are problems - and I see some of your question here resonates with that conflict.,2017-08-31T09:17:24.290,41
7657,3446,1,thats what I am doing here with the question. gathering thoughts to see if it can help me. I want them to not be overwhelmed. Perhaps attend successive Azure workshops which will be more fine tuned. And if enough students show interest I could allow the workshop to evolve into a full on training course.,2017-08-31T09:21:13.547,2605
7666,3441,1,Could you give us more details on what is the curriculum for the class is like?,2017-08-31T11:16:57.707,118
7678,3441,1,I think you should ask for help on the APCS mailing list. You may find others with more experience at this. You would reach a larger audience on the ACM SIGCSE list. Your issue isn't really limited to high-school of course. It can arise in any course at any level. With appropriate changes of language (emphasizing the CS less and the visual elements of the curriculum more) you might also ask it on other forums here at StackExchange.,2017-08-31T13:05:46.007,1293
7682,3451,0,I have updated my question to pinpoint the exact place where things are doing south.,2017-08-31T14:22:56.093,2605
7683,3450,0,Something like the following might help at least a bit. The key is the left-right rule as discussed there. http://unixwiz.net/techtips/reading-cdecl.html. I might try to discuss the C data types as a way to represent Java references and the structs as a way to build objects (with embedded references). Not a perfect analogy but maybe a place to start.,2017-08-31T14:23:30.480,1293
7684,3450,0,I have faced no challenge in using or explaining pointers when they are used within a C file. It is only when I decided to do 'separate files' with the .h and .c I ran into issues. You will find a sample code in the question which I just updated.,2017-08-31T14:25:53.360,2605
7685,3450,0,Pointers should behave exactly the same whether you're using them in a header file or not. In any case after your edits it seems like your actual question is more of a technical one -- I would try asking it on StackOverflow rather then here.,2017-08-31T14:36:24.850,732
7686,3450,0,_@Michael0x2a Agree!,2017-08-31T14:48:45.537,2537
7687,3450,1,Thats all very fair folks. I was hoping if someone could point me to a Pointer + header Files + Struct resource online or explain how it works in a post....that would have really helped me...like how things have been explained in the 'Pointer Examples in C' post.,2017-08-31T15:06:22.047,2605
7688,3441,0,Shouldn't this question be migrated to Academia SE?,2017-08-31T15:08:55.400,2537
7689,3453,0,Yeah thats the link I spent time reading as well before posting the question. I am confused if I should use the one with the * or without the * not using them together. and what do they signify in this context the one with the * and the one without.,2017-08-31T15:13:36.733,2605
7690,3450,1,This also seems to be a question about C and its usage not a question about education. The StackOverflow forum will have better answers.,2017-08-31T15:23:54.483,1293
7691,3453,0,You mean On the other hand if you say typedef struct samplestructrec samplestruct; right? without the *. Assuming that is the case that explanation solves my problem.,2017-08-31T15:29:23.307,2605
7692,3453,0,Yes. Fixed. But still not an appropriate question for CSEducators.,2017-08-31T15:30:55.390,1293
7693,3418,1,_@Sean thanks for clarifying what you meant.  I can see where you are coming from and while I do not agree entirely with your perspective it is food for thought.  I'm going to have to think about this a bit more...,2017-08-31T15:56:55.327,2706
7694,3453,0,`#include` is not ?€?just about as you would treat textual inclusion?€? it is textual inclusion. It is an instruction to the C pre-processor. It tells it to replace the `#include` line with the content of the file. (There are some other `__LINE__` and `__FILE__` stuff included  but this is just to reset some values used by the code that outputs the debug info. You may see this if you look at the output of `cpp` the C pre-processor. ),2017-08-31T16:54:25.813,204
7695,3450,0,_@Buffy I thought this question was asking for help on teaching pointers in C: What can I do to make it easier for my student to learn pointer? If so then it should be on topic. Am I wrong?,2017-08-31T16:56:25.757,204
7699,3450,1,Just because a question arises in a teaching context doesn't make it about education. Had it started out We are building the next Facebook replacement and are running into a header file problem... and then continued at the 3rd paragraph. The question would be the same. It isn't the context that makes it about education though the context is needed. It was a specific C usage question.,2017-08-31T17:24:49.570,1293
7700,3453,0,OK I yield on that. It's been a while since I used C and haven't kept up on advances in processing it so I was being cautious in my statement. But textual inclusion is in my memory bank.,2017-08-31T17:26:34.250,1293

7709,3450,0,The JVM is implemented in C. C pointers are a key part of the Java reference mechanics. You might start from there.,2017-09-01T03:06:37.127,1537

7715,3283,0,I would differ here as Turbo-C was used here in Pakistan as well but it was exactly the reason why I kept loathing programming for a long time. C is difficult or not is a separate topic but Turbo C is an awful IDE (imo) for sure. Being a teacher first thing I managed was keeping an arm's length between my students and Turbo C and it reaped dividends as well.,2017-09-01T07:22:49.490,2537
7716,3283,0,Just to clarify I am recommending go with C but please god please don't use Turbo C indeed. Man that thing (although OKAY at that time 15 years ago) is just awful by todays standards. Its easier to just use an online C compiler and if that is not available Visual Studio or GCC.,2017-09-01T08:25:13.940,2605
7717,3456,3,I just asked a similar question with different end goals last week and it was down voted till it was deleted.  Oh well I am simply glad that another person is talking about Minecraft in the site. Welcome to the site man.,2017-09-01T08:27:22.703,2605

7733,3458,0,Thanks Jay! I have done Bootcamps in the past too but in this institute its not possible unfortunately due to too much students and limited class rooms availability,2017-09-01T14:25:05.647,2537
7735,3459,0,I have updated the question statement to address your queries and I liked your suggestion of checklist tasks.,2017-09-01T14:41:20.973,2537

7745,3462,0,Doesn't that depend quite a lot on the OS? Can you be more specific?,2017-09-01T20:25:51.683,1293
7746,3462,0,Pretty much any useful program effects the system in some way whether reading/modifying a file outputting something to the screen or otherwise.  Even something like `int main(){int i = 0; return 0;}` has to implicitly request resources from the system to store the variable.,2017-09-01T20:30:28.803,753
7747,3462,1,Maybe an opportunity to talk about layers of abstraction in a system. The deeper you go the more likely it is you need to talk to the kernel.,2017-09-01T20:34:59.530,1293

7749,3461,1,_Why did it take you so long? You should be finding this stuff out as early as possible and correcting it before you start throwing tests at them_ I totally agree Kevin!

7752,3466,0,Welcome to CSE Stack Exchange! You obviously know a lot about Haskell but you may want to focus your answer more on procedural habits to break rather than the most difficult concepts to teach in Haskell.,2017-09-01T22:58:27.703,283
7753,3466,1,Thanks. The somewhat hidden message of my answer was exactly that breaking habits happens in the beginning of the course I would say first quater. But the problems with learning a functional language do not stop there. To name such a procedural/OOP habit: syntax of course!,2017-09-01T23:28:23.963,2879
7755,3462,4,The students would probably be familiar with `strlen` and `strcmp` which are not and do not result in syscalls. Then you have `printf` and `malloc` which are not syscalls but which may result in syscalls.,2017-09-02T02:10:56.890,2880
7756,3463,0,I agree +1 however memory mapped IO could result in an implicit system call if there is a page fault. Where as direct IO uses explicit system calls.  Also `printf` may not make a system call: The C library can buffer the data. The library will call flush if the buffer becomes full. You can also call `flush`. You will notice this sometimes ?€?Why does `printf` not work / why is output of `printf` delayed??€?. On a gnu system (such as Gnu/Linux) as well as `strace` you are free to look at the source code (though `strace` may be easier/quicker.,2017-09-02T09:27:17.890,204

7758,3463,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor As I wrote: ?€?Both of these statements have exceptions?€?. A page fault is not a system call. (This may be a matter of terminology but I'll assert it because I'm a professional OS developer and a ?€?system call?€? and a ?€?fault handler?€? are two separate ways to invoke kernel code and this matches Linux and Windows terminology.) Looking at the source code doesn't tell you which system calls are executed at most it lets you see the library calls which as you point out are not directly related (the example of buffered IO is a nice one thanks).,2017-09-02T10:10:32.673,124
7759,3463,0,_@giles [I was not disagreeing with you just exploring these exceptions] I said implicit system call I mean here that it triggers a service routine in the kernel. Is it correct that all access to the kernel is through interrupt service routines (hardware interrupts: page fault device ready; and software interrupts (syscall)?,2017-09-02T10:33:51.147,204
7760,3463,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor It's a bit dangerous to take such a general statement as absolute truth because there's usually some bizarre hardware somewhere. But for a sufficiently broad definition of ?€?interrupt service routine?€? that's true. Depends if you think something like returning from hypervisor mode counts as a software interrupt.,2017-09-02T10:37:51.400,124

7765,3450,1,Using typedef to hide real definitions provides a way to give some opaqueness (example : FILE) to user defined data types.  But It makes more harm than good when you're trying to explain pointers to beginners. BTW you used the same name in both typedefs. Better start with functions over some structs (without pointers like coordinates or dates with day/month/year) and explain pointers for parameter passing of structs. Keep dynamic allocation and chaining for a later stage (topic won't be unfamiliar to your java student).,2017-09-02T17:50:42.633,2103

7774,3471,0,_@bergi Learning to decompose a task into smaller subtasks write code for subtasks and combine it is the key to successful programming. Once learnt transposable to any prog. language. Programming languages provide mechanisms to express subtasks: functions  procedures... It's better to learn use them as soon as possible systematically. That's probably taught within the first 2 hours in the case of functional languages (except if you insist on writing bad Fortran in Scheme). Much later with C C++ Java etc. Functions unfortunately considered an advanced topic.,2017-09-03T09:39:14.213,2103

7778,3471,0,_@MichelBillaud Yes. We think it would improve your answer if you replaced procedural with functional in the first sentence.,2017-09-03T12:20:02.190,660
7779,3472,0,_@Derek it was originally but some variants add mutation. Thing is you don't need much to implement mutation just the basic building block. Therefore functional programming is a state of mind. The best way to get this state of mind is to learn a pure functional language such as scheme. And then add mutation your self when and only when you need it.,2017-09-03T12:31:41.170,204
7780,3468,0,_@BenI. I agree that creating good CS questions is hard. In this case it was a very basic programming course though and I think any book about programming will contain plenty of examples that could be useful. Thinks like for-loops string copying etc.  I understood the OP to be in a similar situation not university level CS. I didn't discuss it with the teacher but I'll have to assume it wasn't a big issue for him since he was willing to do it. I'd imagine they have a set of questions they rotate anyway from year to year otherwise the problem of leaking questions would easily happen.,2017-09-03T13:38:52.457,1090
7781,3478,0,I don't think you can compare Scheme and C in this way.  C _is_ used out there in real world projects. Operating systems and hardware related stuff is still a domain for C programmers. There is much less Scheme outside of education.,2017-09-03T16:43:31.330,847

7791,3475,1,Perhaps I'm corrupted by already knowing programming languages that are so different from Scheme but I've been poking at Scheme for quite some time now and still don't feel like I understand it.  The closest thing I've found to learn Scheme in 10 minutes is this: http://web-artanis.com/scheme.html.  I've also read [Norvig's claims](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) that he could do in 3 days what it took his Java competitors 30 days to do.  I'd love to have that kind of productivity spike but I remain skeptical.,2017-09-04T02:07:33.513,882
7792,3475,1,Scheme therefore remains one of those simple elegant tools that can be compared to a surgeon's scalpel: powerful but taking years to master.  Most people apparently don't have that kind of patience as evidenced by the ubiquity of curly-brace languages and the ongoing obscurity of s-expressions.,2017-09-04T02:14:10.027,882
7793,3471,1,_@Bergi Notice that the answers says Procedural _apporoach_ __not__ Procedural _programming_. The approach to teaching in _functional_ languages is to reduce tasks until each subtask is a single function. That process is a _procedural approach_ to the task while not being _procedural programming_. Let's not argue with terms and definitions when discussing _concepts_ to begin with.,2017-09-04T02:38:45.940,104

7807,3478,1,Your reasoning is flawed.  You are likely correct that teaching C is mainly due to inertia preventing a switch to something more modern.  C has little to recommend it for the purpose of teaching program except that *at one point in time* it was the most popular language around.  Neither of these is true for Scheme.,2017-09-04T11:53:50.813,848
7808,3478,2,Then Scheme has my compliments that it does not have any of the baggage that C has. Further I hope that someday the universities here in India will adopt Scheme so the youth in India can also benefit from it. You know prosperity for everyone :),2017-09-04T12:07:27.010,2605

7814,3480,0,Be sure to go for AngularJS first not Angular (Angular is a rewrite of AngularJS in Typescript) the eco system of Angular is quite different and your student will get lost into it. Binding one controller and a ng-repeat to list data loaded from the server should be like 10 line of HTML and 10 of Javascript. Of course if you want them writing a full application you will have a bit more of work because you will have an MVC on the backend (spring with REST as the view) and on the frontend. Velocity even if not maintened anymore is a good template engine too for backend generation.,2017-09-04T14:40:14.137,1375

7833,3491,0,How difficult is it to explain how to install? (I assume that they must have done command line by now (if not then it would not make too much difference).) They just have to type `sudo apt-get install eclipse monodevelop` (this installs two IDEs) and listen to the rest of the lecture and it will be done.,2017-09-05T09:52:20.570,204

7835,3474,2,__Recent__ languages like Python in contrast to languages like C++ Java is a bit confusing. Python was first published 1991 a quarter century ago. Java 1995. C++ was standardized 1998 (though dating back to 1979).,2017-09-05T11:56:14.770,2916
7836,3491,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor -- unfortunately I can't assume they have command line experience. I also need to give platform-independent instructions: I'm assuming most of my students will use either Windows or Mac. In any case installation by itself isn't the hard part: it's just that all the factors in combination lead to the death by a thousand paper cuts kind of effect if that makes sense.,2017-09-05T12:26:43.010,732
7837,3502,1,To answer your education vs training question -- I'm teaching how to use an IDE partly because I want students to start working on larger projects (specifically in Java) and it feels a bit cruel to have them do that without an IDE. I also think it's entirely possible to simultaneously teach students theory/the fundamentals/how to learn while also preparing them for industry with minimal compromise -- having to pick one seems like defeatism. (This is partly why I'm asking this actually: I have a lot of material to cover so the more efficiently and smoothly I can cover IDEs the better).,2017-09-05T12:42:16.310,732

7846,3475,1,Scheme's grammar is easier to specify to yacc than that of Python (it's probably simpler to just write a Scheme parser freehand) but where's the need to hyper-optimize an operation that happens *once per compiler*? The popularity of curly-brace languages and the ubiquity of byzantine natural-language grammars suggests that learning silly arbitrary grammar rules is massively cheaper for our brains than specifying those rules in BNF. That's not to say there isn't value in kids learning Scheme of course. Just not because it's easy to learn.,2017-09-05T15:01:29.440,2838
7849,3469,0,I was in college for CS(Software Engineering) between 2006 and 2012 never once touched Scheme. I believe it was part of the higher level CS curriculum though. The first language taught there was Python. Another university nearby starts off with C/C++.,2017-09-05T16:26:08.020,2918

Thankfully the problem doesn't seem to be quite as bad as @BenI is describing for me -- rather then complete incomprehension these students (usually Mac users?) just don't seem to know where precisely their files are stored what a home directory is how exactly to use the built-in file explorer GUI etc (but do appear to understand the concept of a folder thankfully).,2017-09-05T21:44:45.823,732

It is a **HUGE** language learning it at the same time as OO is putting to much on the students (zone of proximal development). C# and Java are at least smaller. A better choice is Eiffel (see a touch of class https://www.eiffel.org/doc/eiffel/Touch%20of%20Class%3A%20Learning%20to%20Program%20Well%20with%20Objects%20and%20Contracts ).,2017-09-07T16:55:11.317,204
7891,3455,0,Most of the recent additions to C# / .net have come from Eiffel. Eiffel was the 2nd .net language. Eiffel.net was released on day 0 of .net though it precedes .net.,2017-09-07T16:57:50.023,204
7893,3554,1,I'm sorry I thought I added one reason for using Scheme - that one of the best introductory computer science textbooks is based on Scheme. Other major reasons for using Scheme as an introductory language have already been presented in answers provided prior to my note e.g. its syntax simplicity and its emphasis on data and procedural abstraction. I believe that one should use a language best suited to introducing computer science/programming in an introductory class. Students can learn other languages in common use in follow-on classes.,2017-09-07T17:25:58.013,2925
7899,850,0,Excellent!! This is only example which is comprehensible to a common man!!,2017-09-08T07:10:14.470,2537
7900,980,0,I love these stages and their order showing students good code before having them write their own is a better way to build a foundation of coding skills necessary to tackle more advanced material.,2017-09-08T07:48:12.540,2927
7908,3477,0,Also you have macros.  This is similar to pointers in that the concept is _hard_ to wrap  your mind around.  Now it is data now it is code now it is data again.  Very few languages get this.,2017-09-08T16:25:23.550,1213
7910,860,0,IMHO the main advantage of visual languages is that beginners fear they have to remember the syntax of soooo maaany constructs and basic actions : they choose among the things they see. Convenient at first sight a waste of time later as they know the syntax.  The idea falls flat if they already wrote programs and anyway programming with blocks is not identified in the popular culture to serious programming (like web development doh).,2017-09-08T16:46:43.957,2103
7915,3569,0,Some of these are just what we called in the UK ICT. That is ?€?It uses a computer doesn't it.?€?. However some of them are very good examples: use of python R ones that don't use a computer,2017-09-09T11:00:40.600,204
7916,3569,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Which ones are just using a computer? I respectfully disagree. I purposely chose topics that had a ton of creativity behind them and that could be further explored by particularly interested students.,2017-09-09T15:41:10.240,2068
7917,3569,0,I agree non of them are negative. I was just thinking that some were not very computer science or IT. But using computers to aid in teaching the other subject. This is not a bad thing though just not what I was looking for (for those examples). +1,2017-09-09T18:35:37.370,204
7918,3569,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I don't think it's using computer to teach other subjects at all. I think it's finding the intersection of computer science and other subjects which is where a lot of interesting (and lucrative) research is happening right now. Getting students who are already interested in other subjects thinking about how computer science helps them with their interests is a good thing for everybody involved imho.,2017-09-09T18:38:51.757,2068
7919,3569,1,I agree. You are opening my eyes.,2017-09-09T18:42:55.273,204

7924,3291,0,IMHO if a student can prove that their program satisfies a specification they understand the program. Proof of correctness requires knowledge of types of values conditions on values and much more.,2017-09-10T11:12:52.370,160
7926,3095,0,I doubt this is specific to computer science. It is relevant to any science like physics or biology. The question should be moved.,2017-09-10T11:27:07.277,160

7928,2984,0,I am afraid that your requirements basics and rigor are incompatible. Introductory books are intended for programmers and programmers on average have weaker mathematical background and demands. Hence I recommend to pick a book for each topic in Computer Science. As you can see some answers (A Theory of Objects Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness) are already narrow.,2017-09-10T11:42:14.510,160
7929,2993,0,IMHO this book is not rigorous enough for a mathematician. There are no theorems no proofs.,2017-09-10T11:42:56.157,160
7933,2988,0,_@beroal I know. I was saying that the OP could skip Concrete Mathematics but others might find it useful background.,2017-09-10T14:40:05.200,283

7936,2988,0,_@EllenSpertus thought you meant for the answer. Oh well. Back to our regularly scheduled programming.,2017-09-10T14:44:20.103,1293
7937,2993,0,_@beroal it depends what the OP wants to learn. Not all of computer science is theorems and proofs. SICP is considered the deepest introduction to programming which is part of computer science.,2017-09-10T14:49:20.950,283
7939,3574,2,Good answer a couple of nitpicks. 1. It actually starts on the Experience paragraph this is a matter of style and not actually a problem. 2. Why mention mercurial? And before git?? It might be as good but git has won that war a long time ago. It's the de facto standard and they should concentrate on learning it (knowing subversion is also useful but not much to learn there).,2017-09-10T16:16:37.523,2149
7942,3574,1,Point 1 is not important no need to grok it. With a good GUI like SourceTree for example it's really not that hard you can mostly just use its basic features as you would use subversion. I don't see git being replaced in the near future and if you want a swarm there is [GitTorrent](https://github.com/cjb/GitTorrent). None of this is relevant people who want to work in the industry need to know git you said so yourself in your answer what I don't understand is why you also think they need to learn mercurial and by placing it before git it makes it look like you think it's more important.,2017-09-10T17:36:29.417,2149
7943,3574,14,_@ctrl-alt-delor If a CS graduate can't learn how to use the basic functions git *from the command line* in a day they should give up programming and go into management IMHO. (Don't complicate things by using a GUI that tries to make git look and feel the same as a different product and just gives you all the bad features of both of them!) Also I'm at a loss to see why you should have 200 students pulling anything of significant size *during a lecture* in any case. Lectures should be for *learning* new stuff not practicing using it!,2017-09-10T17:48:26.537,1352
7944,3574,0,The low self worth issue is usually curable unless it's so severe the person is incapable of attempting to do anything at all. Unfortunately arrogance usually isn't a treatable condition IMO - just filter it out in the recruitment procedure!,2017-09-10T17:52:07.873,1352
7945,3544,1,The UNIX alike file systems however **ARE** tag based if you squint just right. I have a file it has an Inode number and a reference count I also have some directory entries scattered around this tree structure that point to the file. One file many names. There is a reason the old school refers to the try structure as directories not folders. Also how did you manage to get those cats to stay in the boxes long enough for a photo? Glue? Velco?,2017-09-10T18:48:00.207,2963
7947,3574,0,_@alephzero I strongly agree regarding using git from the command line.  Regardless of if someone actually interacts with git regularly through the CLI knowing how your tools work under the hood is crucial to being an engineer.,2017-09-10T19:21:05.993,1630

7965,3574,0,As someone who has used CVS Subversion and Git I'd say **Git is only hard to learn if you already learned either of the other two.** Things with the same name mean different things and Git contains concepts not found in the others because it embraces the inherent distributed nature of DVCS.,2017-09-11T08:11:14.437,2972
7966,3576,2,Testing is so hard to learn to do properly that I'd strongly recommend finding a mentor for this. Unfortunately many people who think they know how to test create slow over-complicated test suites which are more for show than actually useful.,2017-09-11T08:13:41.603,2972

7968,3574,2,_@Oleg In the spirit of the question one thing I've learned since graduating is that any tool you can name will have *somewhere* where it's used. Mercurial is the VCS of choice for several sizeable institutions I know of including at least one university. A good software developer keeps abreast of *all* tools researches and develops their own opinions on which is the best for when they're able to choose which to use but is prepared to work with anything for when they're not.,2017-09-11T08:14:47.517,1129
7971,3572,0,Not sure I really like the question as-is but it may be relevant that post-degree employment in the UK seems spectacularly poor in CS (ref some research data from maybe 6 months ago). Supports the 'feeling unprepared'.,2017-09-11T10:08:55.643,41
7972,3576,1,We don't need grads who are good at testing. We need grads who know the value of testing and when to ask for focused help. Also knowing that testing is about catching the failures not demonstrating that 'correct' paths can be found.,2017-09-11T10:16:03.920,41
7973,3574,0,_@anaximander I strongly disagree the question is about what graduates need to learn with the current state of the industry knowing git is necessary mercurial much less so. The rest of your comment about all tools is preposterous ***nobody*** knows all the tools from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version_control_software) and this is not a comprehensive list. By your definition good software developers don't exist and you will need an infinite(probably with higher cardinality than the people making those tools) amount of time to become one.,2017-09-11T10:47:13.040,2149
7974,3574,2,_@Oleg A good developer prioritises what to learn I agree with you there and I agree that as it stands git is a better call. I'm not saying you must know everything; it's just useful to have a general idea of what's out there. If I mention Mercurial to a candidate at interview I'd want them to have heard of it maybe have a rough idea of how it compares to other options and if I said that they'll have to *use* Mercurial I wouldn't mind them having an opinion on that but I'd hope that they'd be open to the idea of using it and learning what they need to learn to be comfortable with it.,2017-09-11T11:03:32.320,1129
7991,3579,0,The second paragraph is both factually true and completely missing the point. Almost nobody in the industry actively works with 40 other people daily. Teams that large are split into subteams. Plus being able to work with **any kind** of team at all would be a huge improvement over the typical CS practice of training students to think that working alone is virtuous and working with others is for cheaters.,2017-09-11T15:26:56.233,1139
7993,3576,1,Hmmm...when I was at uni almost all my programming assignments were automatically run against specific test cases created by the instructor. The test cases were unknown by the students so it forced the students to test their code as failing the instructor test cases pretty much guaranteed a failing grade on the assignment. I remember sometimes the instructors wouldn't even accept the assignment if it didn't pass all the test cases. That was a couple of decades ago and I know times have changed where telling someone they failed hurts their feelings so do universities no longer do this?,2017-09-11T15:34:48.883,2817
7995,3586,0,Copy and Paste into an archive directory as the CM tool is more than sufficient for BS degree course work. How exactly would having a source control tool have saved you from many struggles? IME most companies that new employees go to are using different CM tools than what they already know. Thus they simply use the cheat-sheet created by the CM person and are on their way in minutes. There isn't enough time to learn everything the students are supposed to be learning as it is in most CS programs. Why throw something as trivial as using source control instead of some more overarching concept?,2017-09-11T15:47:19.023,2817
7996,3572,0,Some answers point out that programs might miss out on testing or source control. But even if the program includes these topics some people (including some answerers here) will find the graduate unprepared. It's mostly because they don't understand that the education gives overview and general understanding but can't and won't teach every pecularity and nuance in the languages development processes etc.,2017-09-11T15:49:13.683,1834
7997,3592,2,Exactly how are you going to know the answer to all your wish-list ideas from an interview? Also IME most computer science/engineering grads are introverts and it takes a few years experience before they even start to get better at those social skills you are looking for. But once they add those social skills to those technical skills they become quite good. Thus I mainly look for someone that demonstrates they can learn demonstrated that they are motivated to be a developer and someone that seems like they'll fit the personality of the team they'll be working with.,2017-09-11T15:49:45.160,2817
7998,3586,2,I used source control extensively in college- if you have any projects shared with multiple people its invaluable. Its also really good to be able to have GITTFS and SVN on your resume.,2017-09-11T15:52:21.547,2987
7999,3572,2,They general concepts are taught in every decent CS programme. The day-to-day things like certain tools and languages are usually not taught at least not in entirity because those things become outdated every few years and can be picked up within days (if you have good background in the general concepts) when needed in a certain workplace.,2017-09-11T15:52:55.837,1834
8000,3592,1,_@Dunk it's actually pretty easy. Ask them to talk through how they solve a problem how they resolve conflict with a team member (probably a group project) and a few questions about what would you have done differently on a project? and you get insight into most of those questions.,2017-09-11T16:02:35.813,177
8002,3584,0,But to be a successful programmer is not nearly as difficult as being a pro sports player so I think this is overly pessimistic for people who want to get into programming later in life.,2017-09-11T16:13:13.367,1979
8004,3595,19,`The main thing you need version control for is for group coding projects.` citation needed? I've seen _many_ instances where people do all sorts of things where VCS would be beneficial. Not the least of which is the CS rite of passage doing an accidental `rm -rf` on something important.,2017-09-11T16:22:15.123,177
8005,3595,0,Interesting; in my course (graduated this year) we did five big term-long group projects and probably a couple of dozen smaller group coursework pieces plus more pieces of coursework that could be done individually or in small groups. About the only work that was strictly individual was the exams.,2017-09-11T16:26:27.483,2981
8006,3595,0,_@walrus - Yay! Very encouraged to hear that.,2017-09-11T16:31:47.323,1139
8007,3592,1,pretty easy for someone with job experience. However I can picture the terrified looks in the eyes of new-grads if I asked them the same kinds of questions as their mind becomes completely blank with the cache-swapping going on because I switch contexts and asked them non-computer questions.,2017-09-11T16:42:15.230,2817
8009,3592,0,_@Dunk why do you think I answered a question `What is missing from a typical undergraduate program or not sufficiently emphasized that a person needs to know for successful employment in a software development position` with this list of questions then? What you just said _is entirely the point_.,2017-09-11T17:11:11.290,177
8011,3584,0,you're never going make it or at least the chances are very very slim. There are obvious reasons why it's important to start early with physical activities but I don't see why these would apply to intellectual activities. There are also many many many counter examples for CS (Don Knuth not programming in his teens doesn't seem to have hampered him that much). You just don't need 15 years of muscle memory to be a great engineer - yes the experience helps but the experience you gain as a kid writing MUDs is going to be of limited use later on anyhow.,2017-09-11T17:20:50.010,819
8014,3577,0,Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/65432/discussion-on-answer-by-dan-mills-what-does-a-person-with-an-undergraduate-degre).,2017-09-11T17:33:26.387,27
8017,3593,1,This answer seems to mainly address point b) from the question. Do you have any thoughts on why some universities ignore the benefits to them apart from inertia and lack of time (the latter of which I struggle to believe is a real issue in a 3 or 4 year degree).,2017-09-11T17:41:30.130,2981
8018,3584,0,`I've seen a lot of CS kids where it's just too late already` whaat? nearly my entire team is people who didn't program until after their undergraduate degrees. Are we all exceptions to this rule? I think not.,2017-09-11T17:55:53.960,177
8019,3593,0,_@walrus -- I think it's less that you're ignoring the benefits. Rather it's more that there are just so many things that could be teaching and it's hard to pick. An undergraduate degree has time to cover only a tiny fraction of computer science -- that's a part of why we have masters degrees and PhD programs after all (and even those can only cover a small fraction of what's out there)..,2017-09-11T18:02:24.123,732
8020,3593,2,Also it's worth noting that the university and the instructors themselves don't necessarily get any huge benefit out of using version control (it's sometimes the opposite in fact: somebody needs to set up and maintain all the infrastructure and tooling). Rather it's mainly the students who get the benefit.,2017-09-11T18:02:57.567,732
8021,3580,0,Seems this could equally be asked on a language stack - with regard to either vocabulary or grammar. More likely to be research in natural language teaching I expect.,2017-09-11T18:09:56.007,41
8022,3577,2,Most of these points are not things that a College graduate would/should be expected to know. All of them are nice to knows. Regression testing? I mean I'd love for applicants to have that experience but realistically it may not happen and that's okay. Almost all of these things can and will be taught on the job. Big O notation is the outlier but it is most often taught in CS 201 - Whatever name your algorithms class has.,2017-09-11T18:10:32.563,1028
8023,3584,0,I just graduated with a degree in CS in 4 years from a US college. Before starting college I'd never programmed. By the end of my first CS course I was in the upper half of my class. I disagree that not programming in my teens was a huge disadvantage. I'd say the ability to teach yourself to google and experiment and just not give up until you can do the task at hand is more important then previous experience.,2017-09-11T18:15:21.247,2991
8024,3584,0,_@all - Fair enough and all good points.  Most if not all good programmers I've known all started early on their own initiative and not because they were assigned classwork that required them to learn programming - maybe that's not always the case as it would seem but usually if you're interested in programming you're not waiting around for someone to give you an assignment before you start writing code; you dive in and learn because you want to.,2017-09-11T18:19:14.467,2976
8026,3599,0,Are people still using `rcs`?,2017-09-11T18:26:59.563,204
8027,3599,1,No don't think so - but good version control feels like a fairly new thing and there is a great temptation to teach things as you learnt them as your tutor learn them - etc.,2017-09-11T18:36:50.680,41
8028,3599,4,I think this is probably the main factor. The lifecycle (and inertia) for intro CS courses is quite a bit longer than the cycle for programming developments. Having a robust readily available version control system which can be instituted on a personal level and doesn't require major support infrastructure (e.g. a server) is relatively recent especially when measured against how frequently departments revamp their CS courses. As more people get familiar with Git and the like I imagine it will be incorporated more widely in the best practices suggestions/requirements given to students.,2017-09-11T18:38:35.820,2992
8029,3600,1,I love ?€?rewrite the assignment in their own words?€? I used to do that when I was a software engineer but it did not occur to be to get my students to do it.,2017-09-11T18:40:03.467,204
8030,3600,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor Back when I was a student the fact that I **read the assignment** before starting writing code basically gave me a super power. *How did you know how to do that??* *Well it's written in the assignment right here...*,2017-09-11T18:43:01.663,2068
8031,3598,0,I like the idea of an online portfolio i can read especially for web developers. I would definitely consider a well made one to be a plus when hiring.,2017-09-11T18:43:24.403,2774
8035,3595,14,This answer is ludicrous.  You don't need multiple people to make mistakes you'd like to revert or want to keep track of change history or try out experiments on a separate branch.,2017-09-11T19:28:42.510,2168
8046,3595,0,_@BlueRaja-DannyPflughoeft - You don't need a full-blown revision control tool to do any of that either though and its a conspicuously heavy solution if those are the only tasks you use it for. I was doing all that stuff just fine with VMS and its [automatic edit backup version system](http://www.mcm.edu/tutorial/vaxguide.htm) before I ever heard about their revision control tool. What I **couldn't** do without it was manage simultaneous work from multiple people.,2017-09-11T21:11:15.387,1139
8047,3595,1,Perhaps I should add teaching what a revision-control tool is really for to my list of CS complaints here since clearly a lot of people still don't understand this.,2017-09-11T21:16:59.020,1139
8048,3592,1,Everything you described in your post applies to a good programmer. I don't understand the distinction you made between a programmer and an engineer.,2017-09-11T21:19:16.403,2149
8049,3592,1,_@enderland - Your answer is fine just IMO I don't see a whole lot a college can do to teach much on your list. At most they could have more group projects but I'm not alone in saying that those were the worst assignments ever and I don't think they are as good of learning experience as some people think. Finally I'd be thrilled to death to find some new grad who could write beautiful code and come up with good algorithmic solutions on their own. I'd hire them in a second with the exception being that it is obvious they are going to be a people problem. I'll teach the engineering skills.,2017-09-11T21:24:09.973,2817
8050,3595,0,_@enderland - I believe my first crack at this ever with the VMS tool kept the repository in my main working directory. Early revision control tools liked to work that way and if you didn't like it you had to fake it out with link directories. The VMS equivalent of the rm -rf command would have likely deleted my repository just as easily. Remember that revision control tools are designed for controlling revisions from multiple people. If you can use it as a glorified emergency backup tool that's nice but it isn't its prime designed purpose.,2017-09-11T21:26:59.593,1139
8051,3584,0,Your post applies to what somebody needs to do to become a *good* programmer. With the current supply and demand for programmers lots and lots of bad ones manage to find jobs and stay employed.,2017-09-11T21:28:10.817,2149
8052,3595,0,_@enderland ...today if I use git that mistaken rm command will **still** delete everything I've done since my last merge push up to the master. If the master is in fact in my .git subdirectory because nobody else is collaborating with me then the mistaken rm will delete all my code and all history so your CS rite of passage is probably quite safe.,2017-09-11T21:45:12.340,1139
8055,3593,0,that's one way of looking at it. I suppose I'm surprised that you'd struggle to fit a course with only a couple of hours' content in especially considering some of the things that (both my and other) courses do find time to include.  Regarding the university getting the benefit; I can see that it could definitely be more trouble than it's worth but I can also see that it could make certain things a lot easier to administer for the university.,2017-09-11T22:02:03.843,2981
8056,3595,0,_@T.E.D. part of the rite of passage is understanding the importance of _pushing_ your code somewhere too ;-)  This helps you in industry if you accidentally `rm -rf ~` when you have too little coffee without fully thinking when trying to delete an errantly created folder named ~ (speaking for someone else of course).,2017-09-11T22:05:13.047,177
8057,3601,11,True story: I did quite a lot of theatre at uni and did an entire play script in LaTeX which I of course version controlled using git & github. The director (not at all technically minded) was confused to say the least.,2017-09-11T22:07:52.553,2981
8058,3593,3,_@walrus -- oh don't get me wrong. I think adding an extra lightweight course containing all of these additional things you should probably know is a pretty decent way of solving this particular problem -- that's exactly what my university does in fact. But the path of least resistance for a typical instructor is to modify their (existing) course and my point is that can sometimes be a bit challenging.,2017-09-11T22:09:27.693,732
8059,3595,1,_@enderland - Point is revision control tools don't fix this (and weren't meant to).,2017-09-11T22:19:13.647,1139
8060,3572,0,_@SeanHoulihane - indeed I've often wondered about those statistics.  It seems very odd that a career-oriented degree in a field that is very much in-demand should have such a high graduate unemployment rate particularly when you consider that in the US graduates in the same field have among the *lowest* unemployment rates.  There's something odd going on there and I'm at a loss to explain it.,2017-09-11T23:16:03.390,848
8061,3577,2,An appreciation that it is Worst Case that really matters not average case (This one may be specific to my hard realtime industry). -- I'd say it has good relevance to GUI design too.  A user interface that occasionally stutters and takes too long to complete an operation is a usability problem (and one that is alas all too common).,2017-09-11T23:22:13.800,848
8062,3593,5,Version control isn't that challenging to learn. I disagree with this. When I finally did need to learn version control it took me several weeks to really get the hang of it and I continued to learn more about it for years. And there are many *many* wrong ways of using VCS that are easy to fall into if you aren't taught well or don't have a deep enough understanding of what you're doing. Proper VCS usage could easily cover multiple lectures if not an entire unit in a class.,2017-09-12T00:16:19.367,1360
8063,3593,1,_@Kevin: I suppose it might depend on which VCS you're learning -- there are certainly some quirky ones out there. But I genuinely do think that a CS graduate shouldn't find it too hard to pick up something like Git by working through something like [LearnGitBranching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/): after all Git basically boils down to a tool for manipulating DAGs and graph manipulation should be the sort of thing that's extensively covered both explicitly and implicitly in a decent CS curriculum. The other best practices stuff is only a google search or two away with the right query.,2017-09-12T01:32:01.340,732
8064,3572,0,_@D??uris It's not that they don't understand what education supposedly gives they are looking for people who genuinely love and are interested in programming. Asking them about nuances in languages is one way to find them.,2017-09-12T02:01:24.553,2149
8065,3572,0,_@Jules It's the same thing in Israel. Graduates from top universities are recruited immediately because of their high potential all the others struggle finding their first job. Seems very reasonable to me nobody wants to invest a year until they will see anything resembling productivity from them. If anything it's odd that it's different in US maybe it's because of internship practices?,2017-09-12T02:06:27.223,2149
8067,3609,4,Huh? You don't need a server or Internet access to use RCS CVS Subversion or git; I haven't used any others but I assume they work fine from a pen drive too.,2017-09-12T08:33:44.283,1219
8069,3593,5,I second @Kevin's comment. See e.g. [this](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/2897/735) or [this](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/351607/78464) question. At the very least I **certainly** think it's wrong to say that you could learn Git *trivially* easily. This is supported by the fact that Git's primary documentation includes a [574 page book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and that book doesn't even explain *how* Git works a topic which the same author wrote [a separate 120 page book](https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf) on.,2017-09-12T14:06:04.173,735
8074,3572,0,I can't speak to other countries but here in the US it's assumed that a new CS grad isn't going to produce much for as much as the first year and will require a lot of supervision to do so. I guess businesses just consider it a good way to get an employee relatively cheap - assuming they stay long enough for the investment to pay off.,2017-09-12T15:46:33.393,1884
8077,3607,3,I think the point is not so much that they're difficult to use as that many people struggle to get by without them without realizing that their struggles would be alleviated by simply using version control.,2017-09-12T15:51:01.027,3021
8078,3609,2,_@PeterTaylor true e.g. `.svn` and `.git` folders can also be copied along with the project's subfolders. If revision control was heavily used in those repositories these folders may be bigger than the project itself but they can be completely copied to a pen drive and reused without Internet access.,2017-09-12T15:58:12.520,2906
8079,3572,0,The biggest thing I didn't learn was how to *not* write it yourself. The biggest most embarrassing thing I ever did my first week at work after graduating was writing a search algorithm from scratch because I was treating the assignment like homework. We have a whole framework for that sort of thing that does it way better than I would do myself way quicker!,2017-09-12T15:58:36.110,1263
8080,3593,0,_@Kevin I partly disagree with you.  I think that it's very easy how to learn how to use Git in a single-user environment where you are working out of master never branch and never merge.  (Which describes how you would probably use version control for most school assignments)  I agree though that Git gets very complex very fast as soon as you involve branching and merging.  That when you run into this: http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/,2017-09-12T16:24:05.967,3024
8081,3615,1,I learnt sccs in 1991 it was installed on all of the university computers.,2017-09-12T17:09:34.110,204
8082,3572,1,I've voted to close this question because there are too many possible causes for a CS graduate feeling unprepared to enter the job market. I'd suggest that you ask a separate question about how to resolve a specific concern that graduates have (e.g. lacking in workplace skills missing knowledge etc).,2017-09-12T17:13:13.627,58
8083,3599,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Yes with a [modern wrapper](http://www.catb.org/esr/src/).,2017-09-12T17:18:01.703,3026
8084,3615,0,Your answer rather ignores the fact that most institutions that teach CS will have one or more computer labs with machines on which they can pre install useful software but I can believe that using version control systems was harder in the past than currently and so many institutions will have no tradition/habit of using them.,2017-09-12T17:24:34.173,2981
8086,3593,0,_@JBentley sorry I still disagree. I do think Git is often taught poorly but don't think it's *inherently* hard to learn. All you need to know is that Git is a tool for manipulating DAGs -- you can infer what's possible and how to do it on-the-fly based on just this and a little googling without needing to read a ~600 page manual. For example if you didn't know about something like `rebase -i` you'd still be able to easily infer the existence of this command: you can rearrange nodes in a DAG so Git certainly must support such an operation. You can then google/read the book to get details.,2017-09-12T17:45:21.130,732
8087,3593,0,That said I do agree that if you try and learn Git without knowing about graphs or using a tutorial that doesn't emphasize the DAG that learning to use Git would be challenging: without understanding the underlying model Git would be very cryptic. Unfortunately many tutorials seem to de-emphasize the DAG (possibly to target beginners?) and focus on teaching specific commands instead which is probably why people find Git challenging to pick up. That fact that Git commands are often named unintuitively only compounds the problem for people who learned this way.,2017-09-12T17:46:10.717,732
8088,3610,0,Re it's quite tempting to [...talk] about the CRT and how an electron beam scans...  It's not like you need to explain how a CRT works.  All they need to know is that it scans the screen line by line at a fixed rate that the sync pulses define the top of the screen and the start of each line and that the voltage level controls the brightness of the flying spot.  Shouldn't take more than two or three minutes (assuming you show some illustrations including the wave form at different levels of detail.),2017-09-12T17:47:47.150,1269

8093,3593,5,_@Michael0x2a I've had to teach Git in a commercial setting a few times.  What I have found is that if you can start from learn the *correct* model of how git models everything under the hood and then learn how to use it Git is easy.  However if you cannot justify learning the entire model before doing anything it's very easy to develop wrong models in one's head.  I still grapple with issues regarding the index because I learned it wrong the first time.  Honestly I find most people want to being seeing productivity as they learn not after they learned it.,2017-09-12T19:17:57.713,812

8101,3601,1,I think it's a mistake to say revision control is  computer engineering topic. Revision control should be thought of as an essential tool for any area of study/work that deals with preparing files using a computer. And even if you won't be doing it using a computer the same principles should be learned for preparing creative works by hand - organizing and filing different revisions you went through (rough drafts sketchbook sketches recordings while preparing a song or a speech etc.) - because it's how you study and improve your own processes.,2017-09-12T21:15:10.917,1327

8114,3623,3,Well idk if I have a project idea for you but based on your updated description I think you can immediately reject your last three ideas. If most of your audience is new to programming I don't think they'll either appreciate care or have the background to understand those three mini-projects. I would also recommend not approaching this from the perspective of how can I introduce these students to Haskell/functional programming -- I'd approach it from the perspective of how can I introduce these students to programming and ignore the people who are already familiar with CS.,2017-09-13T05:44:20.187,732

8122,3628,0,We simply do not have the luxury of pursuing something which does not have an endgame that has no industrial applications. For us any time spent learning something is an investment and must have (monetary) returns. Would understanding Scheme eventually lead us to using F sharp better? We understand that it will be challenging but we have already taken that into consideration.,2017-09-13T14:08:29.900,2605
8123,3628,1,Then you have other goals of course than teaching functional programming.,2017-09-13T14:11:55.760,1293
8124,3628,0,That is true. Step 1 : Learn functional Programming with Language X Step 2 : Do something with it. Step 3 : Profits :P However we are still in step 1 and we have to finalise on a functional programming first. If we need to start with Scheme then we will do that but I thought I will ask the experts here first since you folks talk about functional programming so much as it is. My own mentor is convinced that F sharp is awesome for functional programming but he has no option on other languages.,2017-09-13T14:17:49.787,2605
8125,3628,0,At the same time while I got lucky with these 2 students we are unable to convince other students to join us because they are asking us 'what is the end game if we learn'. So if we can prove that functional programming has practical applications we can get more students to participate next year if not this year.,2017-09-13T14:19:53.467,2605
8126,3628,0,I assume your students have most experience with languages that use concrete syntax. A shorter step for them would be ML (OCAML) or Haskell rather than Scheme. It would seem more familiar but would _require_ the change in mental processing.,2017-09-13T14:20:28.890,1293
8127,3628,0,We have already agreed that we will have to fundamentally alter the way we do things with functional programming. We are ready for that. So ML or Haskell. Hmm....alright I will add that to my notes then.,2017-09-13T14:23:00.210,2605

We actually did learn how to *program* (not play - I said programming monopoly in my comment above you twisted it to playing) in university but as an exercise to anchor the learned (theoretical) material.,2017-09-14T11:11:00.563,3038
8149,3590,2,Why Excel isn't thought in CS?,2017-09-14T11:46:37.490,3052
8150,3631,1,I support the call for more clarity on the students. What is the purpose of this class for them? I can't tell if they are a general cross-section of the uni (who need to be taught not to do too many stupid things) or if the cohort believe they will soon be working as infosec professionals?,2017-09-14T12:00:10.530,41
8151,3590,2,Extreme example: using a computer and/or typing with more than two fingers is also desirable for employment and useful during the degree.  Why is it not taught in a CS curriculum (or a Philosophy curriculum as I expect philosophy students to type long essays as well)?,2017-09-14T12:19:18.143,757
8152,3625,3,_@ErikE I don't think that the complement set of university-level stuff is stuff that all students know already or stuff that is taught in high school. See also: using a graphing calculator or a word processor.,2017-09-14T12:24:13.327,757
8153,3609,1,_@Armfoot nitpicking: you probably want to `git clone --mirror` instead of copying the `.git` folder.,2017-09-14T12:25:18.213,757
8154,3609,1,_@Jay `for me version control without server access is essentially useless` -- you are missing out. I'm surprised that you can't find value in having a history and being able to revert your changes alone.,2017-09-14T12:27:00.247,757
8155,3609,0,Looks like I am missing out indeed. My first experience with git was at an office and yeah it was all connected. Yet here I am learning stuff.,2017-09-14T12:42:46.670,2605
8156,3615,2,>Subversion requires you set up a local server on your computer - It can be used without one just like git. This is how we did it at university  a year or two before git was created,2017-09-14T13:32:41.887,1221
8157,3590,1,_@CalculatorScience Because there are more intuitive functional languages available.,2017-09-14T13:44:54.240,654
8158,3590,1,_@TobiaTesan Probably because it's assumed those skills will have been developed earlier in general education. I had classes in middle school about how to type properly (though I'd already developed touch typing skills by that point from personal use). I don't think most grade schools teach how to use version control (yet).,2017-09-14T13:46:18.577,654
8159,3590,0,_@TobiaTesan that strikes me as a bit of a straw man really.,2017-09-14T13:51:58.040,2981
8160,3590,1,_@JAB I have never heard of typing classes in high school where I come from but you can replace that with any practical skill of your choice that happens to be relevant in day-to-day university and work life and is not taught in general education. My point is that at the end of the day there is a plethora of practical skills and mechanical tools you end up learning how to use on your own. Besides it being impractical to set aside more than an epsilon of class time for Word 101 Google 101 Emacs 101 etc...  I am not sure that teaching the use of standard tools is University's main job.,2017-09-14T14:14:50.450,757
8162,3590,1,_@walrus I did say extreme and it was an exaggeration on purpose - but why does it strike you as a straw man? I believe therein lies a possible answer to your question.,2017-09-14T14:23:40.627,757
8163,3623,0,If you can't tackle the problems in 10 minutes yourself don't expect beginners to do so in 1 hour.,2017-09-14T14:48:06.620,2103
8165,3590,0,_@TobiaTesan it struck me as a straw man because it is both extreme and *not equivalent* - as JAB says it's a skill that you can reasonably assume students to have learned before university.,2017-09-14T15:06:51.313,2981
8166,3631,0,What background do the students have? Are they taking this to fulfill some kind of requirement? Are they computer science majors business majors something else? What are they hoping to get out of it?,2017-09-14T17:10:51.550,2068
8168,3334,1,Thanks for pointing out the network bonus. I'd known about it but hadn't thought of mentioning it to my students. FWIW it's pretty easy to gain reputation in English Language Learners.,2017-09-14T21:52:01.027,283
8171,3631,0,Question edited,2017-09-15T01:28:07.950,3049
8175,3632,0,Any suggestions on what math problems I could talk about?,2017-09-15T02:40:59.903,3036
8177,3625,1,I did misread what you said and thought you were referring to playing those games not programming them. My apologies. Had that been your actual statement I would stand by what I said. It was not an ad hominem attack that meant your argument was invalid because you were not an adult but simply that anyone making such a ridiculous statement is not acting in an adult way. What I *thought* you were saying **deserves** to be called not adult.,2017-09-15T06:55:25.103,3048
8178,3625,2,A serious comment then. The types of commits you make what changes you include together how you comment your commits and your workflow options for collaboration and code review are integral to coding. These change how you code. I don't agree version control is an afterthought or mere application like the way you might program a game. I see developers struggle with git *all the time*. It's a valuable tool and all else being equal I would take a developer who'd learned git over one who'd learned b-trees or any other three data structures taught in college.,2017-09-15T07:00:01.407,3048
8179,3625,1,Git rebase splitting a commit index editing fixing problems like the public repo getting rewritten recovering lost commits solving tricky merge conflicts rewriting or replacing a commit several commits back and so on and so forth are super useful knowledge that CS graduates ought to be well-versed in. It's hardly like using a word processor.,2017-09-15T07:03:30.610,3048
8181,3633,0,Thank you @Buffy i edited the question. If you can add other information in your answer feel free to do so. (It already helped a lot  thanks!),2017-09-15T07:43:45.067,3049

8184,3632,0,On the other hand if it's a demo rather than an exercise a functional $O(n)$ Fibonacci can be just `fibhelper 0 a _ = a; fibhelper n a b = fib (n-1) b (a+b); fib n = fibhelper n 0 1`. (Although I suspect an idiomatic Haskell version would use a lazy infinite sequence and take the nth element).,2017-09-15T10:31:30.090,1219
8185,3636,0,I'm not quite sure what you're saying: do you think that as a dinosaur in my mid-30s I use kaolin and India ink?,2017-09-15T10:55:29.160,1219
8186,3636,0,_@PeterTaylor The older we are the more history we have embedded in our knowledge (and less the younger we are). So I do remember the smell of the blue print machine from long ago (only seen kaolin and linen in the museums;-) and I now use Git when I can. At my work site (established during WWII) our (computerised) version control system has many attributes of the older DO systems. In part I was noting that modern CS 'version control' have developed from perhaps unexpected origins - Is it still my grandfather's axe? Is this the one that cuts down trees?,2017-09-15T11:20:58.733,1759
8187,3636,0,Welcome to CSEducators. While history isn't our main focus here it was nice to see a bit of it here. As an old person I can agree..... wait I forget...,2017-09-15T11:54:07.410,1293
8188,3632,0,_@PeterTaylor very good. However you made an error: you call you called `fib` with 3 arguments. I changed it to `fibhelper` tested it thought it through and it worked. Fixed code `fibhelper 0 a _ = a; fibhelper n a b = fibhelper (n-1) b (a+b); fib n = fibhelper n 0 1`,2017-09-15T12:01:35.200,204
8189,3639,0,I downloaded structure and interpretation of computer programs a short while ago. It is available in html and pdf. I would also recommend this book. May be not as a reference book but as a learning book. Can you get a scheme reference book I thought you could only get a scheme back of a postage stamp. This language is so tiny.,2017-09-15T12:07:09.840,204
8191,3638,0,Is the reference book for you or the students? What level students are you teaching? What do you want them to learn?,2017-09-15T13:30:36.700,283

8194,3627,0,I think that Scala looks interesting and it builds on the JVM.,2017-09-15T00:26:45.903,21
8195,3636,0,_@Buffy the history helps provide the why's that put the how's into context ;-). E.g. I personally like FORTH as a language (1976-) because of it's ease of use and contrasts with other programming styles. (Knowledge of) It helps one think!,2017-09-15T14:58:47.613,1759
8200,3638,0,_@Jay: If you plan on using the SICP book along with Racket keep in mind that the dialect of Scheme taught using the book isn't exactly the same as Racket. However Racket has this interesting feature that lets you change/modify the language to all sorts of different dialects and variations of Lisp including a [variant designed specifically to be compatible with SICP](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) which you may want to use.,2017-09-15T15:29:49.343,732
8202,3640,1,DrRacket along with [How To Design Programs second edition](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/) was the way I learned FP as the Intro CS course at my undergrad.,2017-09-15T16:32:45.043,2842

8205,3641,0,Huh I didn't know GNU had another Scheme implementation besides Guile. I think this is the first time I've seen them have 2 programs for the same task. Kind of weird as I thought their (original) grand goal was to make their ideal open source operating system.,2017-09-16T00:47:38.093,1482
8206,3638,1,_@Jay Please don't count on people to read both questions. Put the same information in both questions instead.,2017-09-16T03:04:21.507,58
8207,3637,0,Can you elaborate on the type of class you're teaching and the type of students? That could impact implementation choice.,2017-09-16T03:05:29.647,58
8208,3638,0,I'd recommend HtDP Little Schemer and SICP in that order based on my own preferences,2017-09-16T05:45:04.923,130
8209,3638,0,_@thesecretmaster I don't think they are the same question. I would like to keep them separate as per community guidelines on not making things too broad.,2017-09-16T06:51:16.640,2605
8210,3638,0,_@xuq01 I will add your recommendation to the consideration list. perhaps post your suggestion as an answer if possible.,2017-09-16T06:52:08.727,2605
8211,3590,1,Very well you can indeed assume students who graduate from high school know how to use a graphing calculator or Excel. But in high school they don't have classes on how to use a graphing calculator or Excel and certainly middle school children don't know their way around the things so how do they learn? It's just another example of a handy tool that people can and eventually *will* learn to use on their own by R'ing the good ol' FM if you get what I mean. Excel is to high school what a VCS or an IDE is to college.  At least that's my humble point of view: it's not the University's job.,2017-09-16T08:07:19.653,757
8212,3638,0,You might also be interested in [Concrete Abstractions](https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/concrete-abstractions.html) - which is available online for free as well as in dead tree form.,2017-09-16T08:09:52.137,757
8213,3638,0,I shall look into that. and as always a more detailed sentence as an answer post would be most useful since comments can get deleted after some time.,2017-09-16T08:50:32.823,2605
8214,3641,0,_@Jol I did not know they had two ether (I did not know about guile). As for there goals the main one: ?€?The goal of GNU was to give users freedom?€? that is all software should be Free Software. Then to make an Operating System and all of the software that runs on it (directly or with other peoples help). From the name I think MIT way have written this scheme.,2017-09-16T10:06:14.910,204
8215,3641,0,_@Jol While (almost) all Open Source software is Free Software they are not the same. Some philosophical differences. Also I have found it very difficult to explain Open Source but easy to explain Free Software. People often miss represent both: When someone says ?€?for free?€? it is easy to correct them. Just explain the meaning of free (not free of charge but free as in freedom). When someone says that ?€?source code openly available?€?. It is much harder to put them right. All that can be done is point them to a long definition document. Also Source is focused on developers Free is about users.,2017-09-16T10:14:32.420,204
8218,3648,0,Thanks. Can you tell more about I am doing something similar but with functional programming? By functional programming do you mean some other languages than C#?,2017-09-17T12:09:33.460,1532
8223,3646,0,_@Buffy: I value concepts as much as technical details in specific languages because that will help me learn concurrent programming knowledge that can apply to all/most languages without being lost in the differences between specific langauges. I am not sure if searches in specific languages will help me achieve that goal.,2017-09-17T12:50:30.450,1532
8224,3648,0,I do a lot of self learning too and most recently (since 3 days or so) I have started self learning functional programming and asking questions about books and stuff.,2017-09-17T13:03:48.153,2605

8230,898,0,Giovanni is asking about CS1 and CS2 in a post-secondary environment. The typical high-school course articulated to post-sec CS1 is AP CS A a course using Java and the syllabi are required to indicate that the course includes teaching waterfall methodology. So College Board thinks we should teach methodology in high school CS.  They name waterfall rather than Agile only because the objectives are stale. In writing a high school CS curriculum I interviewed industry engineers. Agile and version control were named often as skills that they wanted to see more of in undergraduate programs.,2017-09-19T05:02:31.367,765

8232,3656,2,Do you know if lack of effort is a problem just in your class or with your university as a whole?,2017-09-19T06:11:01.007,732
8233,3656,0,Hello Ryan welcome to your community. Hope you enjoy it here and ask many good questions. You can also look at existing questions and add an answer. This question may be of some relevance to your question https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1410/how-do-you-encourage-students-to-take-criticism-of-their-code-constructively?rq=1,2017-09-19T07:51:09.403,204
8234,3656,0,Gaming development or coding or just learning in general there is not much you can do to encourage masses to do something. if you are talking about an individual then sure but a whole class....thats a tough one.,2017-09-19T09:14:10.607,2605
8236,3656,0,It might also be the fact that these are upper level graduate courses that is at the heart of the problem. Such students may have more pressing concerns than this course.,2017-09-19T10:40:03.300,1293
8237,3657,0,In addition games like Planning Poker (Scrum Poker) can help a class of individuals meld into a team quickly. It is used in industry partly for that purpose: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker,2017-09-19T10:44:40.333,1293
8238,3656,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se] Ryan!  May I ask what country this is in?,2017-09-19T12:47:27.617,27
8239,2537,1,This question might benefit from a [tag:united-states] tag. It could as well be written in Greek for (non-Greek-speaking) people from other academic cultures.,2017-09-19T14:50:31.833,1219
8241,3656,0,What were the prereqs for the class? What language or framework are you using? What types of games are the students creating? What are you covering in lecture? What exactly is expected from the homework assignments?,2017-09-19T17:38:46.663,2068
8242,3658,0,Even fining (reducing grade) for lateness may not work. There was a study that showed that when a day nursery fined parents for late pick-up. late pick-ups increased. Parents no longer felt guilty they just paid the fee (they saw it as $fine = fee$).,2017-09-19T17:42:58.267,204
8243,3656,0,_@KevinWorkman I added a response to these questions in the main topic since I should have included it in the first place.,2017-09-19T19:49:30.433,3078
8244,3658,0,Assignments that get turned in late are reduced by 10% each day. If you are late 10 days you get a 0. Also the assignments are laid out in such a way that student X and student Y may have completely different games by the end of the semester but still get 100% on every assignment. It gives students the freedom to make games that they find fun and exciting instead of Make pac-man.,2017-09-19T19:52:23.097,3078
8245,3663,0,Thank you! I added another edit to the main topic to answer some of your questions. The students aren't under prepared I can assure you. To get to this point every single one of them have had to take the same courses. I've been a TA for a while and there were classes I took Sophomore year where X person was there with me. I then TA'd that class a year later and they were in it again failed and now I'm the TA in that class again this year and they are in it again and they either haven't turned in the assignment or turned it in two days late. (I'm speaking about two individuals),2017-09-19T19:56:49.837,3078
8246,3663,0,Feedback is given on every assignment that doesn't receive a 100%. It is given both at a broad level and for each section of the rubric. I try to keep it down to just a few paragraphs because I know that when I see a wall of text I generally move on unless I'm truly interested. Also your comment about asking them to respond to the feedback on the next assignment is brilliant and I'm going to try to work that in.,2017-09-19T20:00:33.960,3078
8247,3664,0,Oh my god... I put upper level graduate when I meant upper level under-grad... Besides that answering your bullets: I've talked to many students and I've gotten feedback that there is too much homework given but there is no way that we can reduce the load considering it is roughly 5 hours a week for the average person (per class of course). In terms of how I can help them I offer office hours and basically 24/7 methods of contact yet I only ever get contacted by those who are already getting A's. Those who are struggling never contact me or the professor.,2017-09-19T20:06:28.547,3078
8248,3664,0,Make it anonymous. Then you might get different (possibly more honest) answers.,2017-09-19T20:08:51.913,1293
8249,3664,0,The GDD degree at my University is essentially a UX focused CS degree done with game design. IE: Instead of Assembly and Machine Language you take UI design and development. So if their goal is to be a game designer programmer or UX dev then these courses benefit them greatly. While they might not be focused on doing well in class or building a portfolio they know how useful it is in the long run because of how often I talk about my person experiences with it. I had a hard time getting a job with just a resume but once I put everything in a portfolio I got a few calls within a week.,2017-09-19T20:10:22.247,3078
8250,3664,0,That's a great idea. I'll work on getting an anonymous feedback system in place.,2017-09-19T20:12:05.627,3078
8251,3665,0,You bring up some good points and I agree with you entirely. There might be some issues in the course structure but I am certain the key contributor is the lack of motivation. Myself and the Professor are available almost 24/7 through email and phone yet the only people who come talk to us are the ones getting A's already. I know for certain these students are capable of doing this material as they often do in-class labs that involve developing with Unity3D. Also the first assignment was to create a minimum viable product which is as simple as to make the first level in super mario bros.,2017-09-19T23:16:45.247,3078
8252,3665,0,Am I wrong in assuming that a 3 credit hour course should have ~5 hours of homework per week? Could this be something that is intimidating them to where they put it off until the last minute?,2017-09-19T23:19:55.190,3078
8253,3665,0,_@Ryan Take a look at my edit whenever you get a chance. But I will say that doing an in-class lab (where you have neighbors to ask the topics are fresh in your mind etc) is a different beast than going home and doing a homework assignment. One does not equal the other.,2017-09-19T23:32:44.127,2068
8254,3628,0,Just to add to user2923's comment: if you teach them OCAML they can use it for F# in the 'real world' (it is pretty much ML compatible). I was taught OCAML at University (already knowing some F#) and even ended up using F# documentation for some of the ported libraries because I had an easier time reading them. This way you hide away the 'imperative' features without using an 'obscure' language.,2017-09-20T09:50:32.473,1333
8255,3663,1,_@Ryan -- the more I think about it the less comfortable I feel with my answer (and by proxy you accepting my answer). I have to agree with Buffy and Kevin in particular -- if 85% of your students are getting Cs and Fs I do think that there's some fundamentally deeper issue at play that lack of motivation alone doesn't explain. And if that's the case making things harder as I suggest would be a terrible move to make. I'd start by getting feedback first talking with your professor and other professors + TAs in your department before making any changes.,2017-09-20T13:43:50.107,732
8256,3663,1,_@Ryan -- I also want to remind you to keep in mind that *not all students are you*. While *you* may have excelled at your coursework and found it to be engaging interesting and valuable that doesn't mean that other students have done the same. I've been guilty of falling into the same sort of trap myself: just because you might find something doable doesn't mean it actually is for the majority of students.,2017-09-20T13:50:08.693,732
8258,3666,0,Does your school have independent studies? (Where the student spends a semester doing research under your guidance for credits towards graduation.),2017-09-20T20:56:20.860,2068
8259,3666,0,?€?Gifted?€? do you mean born in September? (birth date is a bigger predictor of educational outcome than parents wealth/income). But more importantly see Carol Dwecks work on mindset ?€?I don't believe in ability?€? or more precisely I don't believe that thinking about ability produces good out comes.

8260,892,0,Yes build something useful. Something fun if you can. That would probably work with Scratch as well.,2017-09-21T11:48:57.800,1293
8272,3670,2,Some more context might help us to answer your question.,2017-09-21T16:31:47.943,41
8274,3670,4,What exactly do you want them to do during these breaks? I don't see how standing around in the hallway looking at my phone for 10 minutes is any better than staying in my chair and looking at my phone for 10 minutes. How do you know this is making them unhealthy? You've tagged this with [tag:adult-education] so treat them like adults. If they don't want to take a break then there isn't much you can (or should) do.,2017-09-21T17:00:31.693,2068
8275,3672,0,Since the difference between a compiler and an interpreter is actually very small most good compiler books will give you the basis. The difference is only in the back end where an execution engine replaces the code generator. The front and middle sections are the same: scanning parsing semantic analysis maybe some optimization. It may even create intermediate code and work from that. Otherwise from the parse tree usually.,2017-09-21T20:52:34.120,1293
8276,3672,0,And welcome to CSEducators.,2017-09-21T21:21:20.023,1293
8277,3672,0,Can you give some more context about the age of the students the previous experience the environment etc? Also welcome!,2017-09-21T21:56:13.993,58
8278,3666,0,If you have a 9th grade student doing PhD level work you have a gifted student. Not every adult can do that level of work so why would you expect that every student can? Would you deny Reed Jobs (son of Steve Jobs) his role in cancer research because he was in 10th grade when he started? Would you expect every 10th grade student to have that natural ability?,2017-09-22T02:59:47.103,1537
8279,3667,0,+1 My daughter was already experienced in videography when she started high school so she spent much of her high school time teaching video and media classes  allowing her teacher to do the non-teaching parts of the teaching job (securing funding planning projects etc).,2017-09-22T03:04:46.493,1537
8280,3670,1,Hey man I hope this is not a joke. Are they glued (literally) to their seats. Or are you that good a faculty that they don't wish to stop hanging out with you. I got to vote to close this question.,2017-09-22T04:44:14.467,2605
8282,3671,0,If you can teach something in this game time even better: They will learn something and may engage more (as they don't see it as wasting time). Also explain why you are doing it as this will help.,2017-09-22T08:28:36.283,204
8283,3670,1,I have had this same problem in industry. It can result in reduced performance lower quality code as well as poor health. First explain why they need breaks and that you expect them to take them and not use hand held devices as a substitute to a break. Then issue consequences when they are overdone ( Ask a question of someone that did not take a break and looks tired make them stand outside for not paying attention. Be real mean but fair. ),2017-09-22T08:37:31.240,204
8285,3526,1,+1. The (main) reason I still use emacs for development: I haven't come across enough problems that require a 'modern' IDE to fix.,2017-09-22T14:51:04.140,2040
8286,3670,2,_@ctrl-alt-delor If I took a class for adults and the teacher made me sit outside as punishment because I didn't take a break in the middle of class I would immediately ask for my money back.,2017-09-22T16:29:55.193,2068
8290,3670,0,_@KevinWorkman I said nothing about punishment. I said consequences. I no most people don't know the difference and substitute the word when asked to change there behaviour. So if they fall asleep send them for a break send them now and choose a now that will have the biggest impact.,2017-09-22T18:20:07.053,204
8291,3675,0,The way you pose the question suggests that you have doubts yourself. Given that I don't think it will work. However an analogy doesn't need to be perfect in every way. If it were an exact match it wouldn't be an analogy but the real thing. You can use a simple analogy to introduce a topic and get the synapses in the student minds aligned in the right direction. For the deeper case either use a more sophisticated analogy or depend on the fact that they already know something about the topic so analogy is less important.,2017-09-22T18:33:32.107,1293
8292,3670,3,_@ctrl-alt-delor A negative consequence that is enforced to be real mean as a result of violating some rule is literally a punishment. My point still stands. This question is about [tag:adult-education]. Saying that the teacher should make an adult stand outside as punishment for not taking a break is ridiculous.,2017-09-22T18:36:10.640,2068
8294,3670,1,_@kevin if being hit by a car is a punishment for not looking then you are correct. Saying that being an adult is a licence to not have consequences for your actions (to be irresponsible) ?€?,2017-09-22T18:38:06.630,204
8295,3670,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor I mean it kind-of is. But we aren't talking about that. We're talking about a teacher forcing a student to sit outside because the student didn't do something that the teacher wanted them to do. That's a punishment.,2017-09-22T18:39:39.473,2068
8300,3677,3,Seems a bit weak actually. Where is the recursive call? Might be better for `while loops` where you also need a stopping condition.,2017-09-22T20:00:05.257,1293
8302,126,1,I read this to my intro class when we introduce recursion. It's not a perfect match but works really well to intro the concept. Plus high school kids love it when their teacher reads them a Dr. Seuss book.,2017-09-23T14:04:36.573,30
8303,3679,1,This is probably a US only question. I think many other countries require more training for teachers. In the US the requirements differ radically by place and by type of school. But as the poster implies there are few subject level requirements for CS teachers at this level. Worse not every CS teacher actually desires to teach it being required by circumstances.,2017-09-23T23:49:26.623,1293
8304,3671,3,What does any of this happy-clappy nonsense have to do with *learning computer science?* If I was forced to take part in that sort of time wasting I would just leave the class - and you are *forcing* people to take part through peer pressure from those who will prefer throwing balls around to using their brains.,2017-09-24T01:35:01.820,1352
8305,3679,3,Teacher requirement differ by State. Most States have no certification for CS at all but some are changing that. Answers from faculty involved in teacher preparation (from any country) are welcome. Although my question is hypothetical?€?what should a program include??€?I am interested in hearing about successful existing programs.,2017-09-24T10:09:31.207,2197
8306,3679,0,Are you asking because you want to create one? Is it just for one school? If you already exists maybe for a different place would you be interested in adopting it? Can you update question not just reply to comments.,2017-09-25T08:49:16.383,204
8307,3666,0,what kind of gifted? that is quite a broad term and one that has quite a few levels. Gifted students might have extreme abilities in some fields and almost nothing in other fields. Could you explain what kind of things make it clear (beyond a professional diagnosis which I assume exists) that said students is gifted? some things he or she said that shows a special way of thinking perhaps.,2017-09-25T09:51:49.743,150
8308,3684,0,Since there have been recent meta discussions about the suitability of questions without clear answers this looks to me like a good specific question where the answers may be useful for lots of different scenarios.,2017-09-25T10:36:55.267,41
8309,3684,0,User interaction design or user interface design? There is a difference. User interaction design is not just a new name it is a new way of thinking (see the inmates are running the asylum ?€? Alen Cooper for a good introduction).,2017-09-25T11:21:38.240,204

8311,3684,0,Are you looking for case studies of good design or horror stories primarily? The latter are more dramatic of course.,2017-09-25T12:20:49.237,1293
8312,3679,0,I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because I think when it comes choosing faculty for an established education system there are already systems in place. Set protocols which seems to be working okay. Unless you can give a new context I believe this question is no serving any specific purpose.,2017-09-25T13:00:50.450,2605

8322,3679,2,This question is getting at something interesting but I think it needs to be more specific to be on-topic. Theoretical or just wondering questions are off-topic as per the help center. I'm voting to close for now but I hope you edit your question to be more specific so we can reopen it.,2017-09-25T16:23:57.377,2068
8323,3675,0,I don't think any analogy is going to help. Delegates are conceptually pretty simple. The problem is that the .NET implementation is a bit weird and no analogy can help with that. The fact that delegates are an abstract concept means that you should be trying to explain _how_ to use them not how they work. Don't talk about power strips - which are concrete and nothing like delegates - talk about _events_ and _callbacks_ and show them _Linq_. Give them some use cases and let them work out the rest (there is much).,2017-09-25T16:40:29.833,1333
8324,773,0,I had a quick scan through the first part. I wouldn't say it's undergrad level but maybe I missed some detail by not looking at the lab work. It feels to cover too much of the low-level implementation (an add in verilog is '+' not a mess of gates!) none of the interesting parts of an architecture and really feels quite software orientated. It addresses it's stated aims but for computer architecture to the point where you'd understand someone explaining a specific MCU implementation you need more detail in the middle layer.,2017-09-25T20:37:10.687,41
8325,764,0,Not a course but this ARM document covers an implementation of architecture from a mainly software perspective. Skim through it and it may give you a feel for the scope of the problem. http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0552a/DUI0552A_cortex_m3_dgug.pdf Questions on the details might be on topic on EE.SE.,2017-09-25T21:19:35.120,41
8326,3666,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor yes growth mindset is important but to be quite honest it is ridiculous to pretend that all students are at the same level. Some students are ready for more advanced study than others.,2017-09-25T23:14:29.690,919
8327,3687,3,+1 for the first paragraph agreed completely. I'll just add that I'd also get sick of constant let's get up and moving! type activities. I'm there to learn. I paid money to be there. Don't waste my time with cleverly disguised breaks that I know I don't need. (Or that I might not be physically capable of! Being an adult sucks and my knees aren't what they used to be!),2017-09-25T23:42:48.113,2068
8329,3671,0,_@alephzero *Breaks* have to do with *learning*. I'd love to see how well you function after 4 hours of continuous learning with 0 breaks. As for the happy-clappy nonsense this heavily depends on the teacher. And I have to admit you have to be on a very very high level to pull this sort of thing off. But if you can it will work wonders. Also **this answer is about spending time during the breaks and clearly about elementary school** level. Why would it upset you is beyond me...,2017-09-26T10:51:49.363,51
8330,3687,0,Why would it offend you that a break is held e.g. every 90 minutes? The teacher needs it more than you but you would need it too. (Even @KevinWorkman needs it at least his mind and body does even if he denies it.) Breaks are not a waste of time just like sleeping. Yes we sleep every day what a waste of time! But try working after 24 hours of wakefullness...,2017-09-26T10:55:08.030,51
8331,3687,0,The 2nd and 3rd paragraphs deserve a + though.,2017-09-26T10:58:05.567,51
8332,3671,1,Actually I did this with _adults in a doctoral program_ but just for the reasons you suggest. It is very successful - and necessary - and team-building. However if you are seen by your students as primarily authoritarian then just send them out and lock the door. (No I didn't really say that.) As I said above it is teen-agers who have the hardest time with such a solution. On the other hand if a student came to me as a brain in a jar then I'd probably exempt them from game-time. But they would resent the fact they were left out I think.,2017-09-26T11:34:31.403,1293
8333,3687,0,_@vacip sure there's a place for breaks but that place is not in a paid for adult education class.,2017-09-26T12:03:41.640,919
8334,3690,0,While I think the question is more about students working by themselves for too long to be healthy there is research that suggests that a lecture should not exceed 20 minutes or the attention starts to drift. The idea is to break up longer sessions with lecture and other more active things though not necessarily physical activity. The usual thing is to use active learning after a short lecture.,2017-09-26T12:05:09.527,1293
8335,3690,1,You've added some example context which is still absent in the original question - I expect that in this context the breaks are more likely to be taken (e.g. lunch even in the same room requires some engagement). I don't see the experience you're describing reflected in the original question. Fortunately you've not suggested gamification of the primary activity...,2017-09-26T12:05:18.923,41
8336,3687,0,_@heather even if that class lasts 360 minutes (4*90 minutes but I do hold breaks) - this is the case in many adult education intensive courses actually 90% of the courses I hold. I'd love to hear your opinion on this at 14:30 when there is still 2 hours to go with no lunch or toilet break since 9 AM. :),2017-09-26T12:49:07.543,51
8337,3686,0,Thanks Jay. I very much like the idea of discussing some screw-ups and their fixes in combination with relying on familiarity. And thanks for the link to the Wikipedia page! Could you point me to some more detailed sources thta you have found useful (if any)?,2017-09-26T13:31:17.713,3117
8338,3685,0,Thanks for the response! I think you have a good point that I need to get them hooked somehow. I'll definitely take a look at Alan Cooper's book to find inspiration. However my experience with my own classmates in these kinds of courses is that if you show them examples of clearly bad UIs they'll be engaged but they'll also say: That's obvious why would I need to take a course to learn this? But I'll see if Cooper has some examples in which the problem is not as obvious - and then let my students think about what could be wrong before giving them the answer.,2017-09-26T13:36:41.550,3117
8339,3684,0,_@SeanHoulihane: I'm glad you think so!,2017-09-26T13:39:30.757,3117
8340,3684,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor: Interaction design. Although there is a big focus on just UI the focus is broader than that. Thanks for pointing it out though. I'll be aware of it when looking at Cooper's stuff.,2017-09-26T13:40:52.143,3117
8341,3684,0,_@Buffy: I'm just as interested in case studies of good design as I am in horror stories. I'd like my students to learn to reflect on why something works well not only to be able to point out (obvious) flaws. Thanks for asking.,2017-09-26T13:40:56.263,3117
8342,3691,2,http://csunplugged.org/ has some good active learning stuff and all relating to computer science.,2017-09-26T14:11:12.783,204
8343,3687,0,_@vacip Please understand what is being said before you attempt to offer criticism. I never said that nobody should take breaks. I'm simply against the idea of **punishing** students who would rather remain seated during said break. I'm also against the idea of using children's games to trick adults into being more active on these breaks. I'm an adult. I paid hundreds or thousands of dollars to be in the class. I'm not there to play ring around the rosie or to stand in the hall as punishment for not being active during a break.,2017-09-26T16:25:04.827,2068
8344,3690,0,I don't really disagree with anything you said here. Please note that most of the hate in this question is directed at the idea of **forcing** students to take a break in a certain way or to **punish** them for not taking a break exactly how the teacher wanted them to. If I recharge by looking at Twitter for ten minutes who are you to tell me otherwise? I'm pretty sure you and I are saying more or less the same thing especially with your last paragraph.,2017-09-26T16:29:23.300,2068
8345,3687,0,_@vacip oh I meant in terms of breaks being required/for anything other than quick-use-the-restroom-get-a-drink breaks (or lunch breaks or whatever).,2017-09-26T20:28:06.430,919

8347,3693,0,Thank you for the general advice. :) My classes are mostly hands-on classes with lot of practice so not a lot of frontal lectures in it. Anyhow I'm looking for actual wake-up exercise ideas. Nap time role playing algorithm related questions session - good ideas. I'll leave the question open though in hopes of more. Thanks!,2017-09-27T07:44:49.763,51
8348,3691,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Really nice! Why not post it as an answer (add two more sentences and maybe highlight one idea from the site)?,2017-09-27T07:45:41.863,51
8349,3691,1,For the drive-by downvoter: why not add a comment to let me know how I can improve the question? Same goes for the answer downvote... I'd love to improve it if you told me what was wrong.,2017-09-27T07:47:10.507,51
8350,3691,1,I've not voted on either Q or A yet but it only takes one bad experience with 'fun games' to turn people against them. Once one irresponsible trainer has pushed someone over the edge just the suggestion of gamification is enough to trigger some people to walk out.,2017-09-27T08:36:03.883,41
8351,3695,3,I wonder whether your primary mission is to create scholars or professionals. Are you mostly getting students ready for university or for jobs in industry? I think those sorts of overall goals should have a strong influence on what you do.,2017-09-27T14:14:01.173,1293
8352,3697,1,I have used a tool to automaticaly create UML class diagrams form code. Because we needed them it was policy.,2017-09-27T18:29:07.867,204
8353,3696,13,I disagree that `goto` has no place; I would agree that there is little value in teaching it to new programmers: it can be mentioned (and discouraged) and they can work it out for themselves when (if) they need it. There is nothing to it if you can already 'read' code and one is more likely to understand why it is generally inadvisable with an existing understanding of higher-level flow-control techniques (as opposed to Here is `goto`! NEVER USE IT),2017-09-27T18:29:27.560,1333
8356,3697,4,Flowcharts work well as a tool to define/describe the desired flow (on a higher level) of a program. They can be important tools when explaining your program to a stakeholder or when attempting to grasp a new subject domain that you are developing for. I would argue they're not a waste of time to learn when used correctly.,2017-09-27T19:51:16.193,3131
8357,3696,27,As an old programmer (learned on a TRS-80 in 1980) I think that teaching GOTO **is** a good idea because it teaches the students that at the bottom of all that fancy flow control and OO stuff are nothing but jumps (both conditional and unconditional) and pointers.,2017-09-27T20:32:15.670,3132
8359,3704,1,Hey LordFarquaad! Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-09-27T20:59:13.017,58
8360,3700,1,There is a fourth one: `throw`.,2017-09-27T21:10:45.993,653

8362,3700,1,Also note that the Java virtual machine bytecode has unconditional jumps (of course). It could be instructive to show the bytecode for loops and conditional expressions (instead of comparing unrelated 6502 assembler).,2017-09-27T22:33:33.467,1675
8363,3696,8,You'd be surprised how many people don't seem to get the computer does things in the order they're written - flowcharts *might* help explain that.,2017-09-27T23:31:10.190,1275
8365,3700,1,_@PeterA.Schneider 6502 is useful for me because it is what they have studied so it's a good point of reference. It's also a beautifully clean and simple assembly language,2017-09-28T01:51:54.580,27
8366,3704,1,Don't forget that COBOL is still the most prolific language out there and all of the flow control in COBOL is through equivalents to GOTO,2017-09-28T01:57:33.837,1537
8368,3696,7,_@immibis computer doing things in order : a typical misunderstanding is thinking that during a `while ( x != 0) { statements; }` the `x` variable is monitored  during the statements execution and the loop break as soon as `x` gets the value 0.,2017-09-28T06:59:45.107,2103
8369,3699,20,People should actually read Dijkstra's letter. He states the less gotos the better. The context at the time was goto's for everything including decision and repetitions. Dijsktra advocated that programming languages should include constructs (like while/repeat until if-then-else) helping to avoid the use of goto. Didn't say that loops/if-then-else were sufficient constructs to get clear code without gotos (talks about Jacopini's theoretical way to eliminate all gotos where euphemistically the resulting flow diagram cannot be expected to be more transparent than the original one).,2017-09-28T07:20:29.873,2103
8370,3704,1,Although this makes sense as an answer I'm not sure it will help the subset of teachers most at risk of incorrectly introducing GOTO to their cohort.,2017-09-28T07:23:45.927,41
8371,3696,39,If you don't teach the kids about `goto` they will learn it on the streets.,2017-09-28T07:50:58.210,3138
8372,3711,0,I agree except the last paragraph interrupts cause subroutine calls not `goto`.,2017-09-28T08:06:07.093,204
8374,3707,0,I agree that flow charts in non-programming contexts is often good. For example to describe a manual procedure. Flowcharts are an abstraction of unstructured code such as assembler. If your machine is a human then this is appropriate.,2017-09-28T08:37:03.250,204
8375,3710,0,You have used a flowchart to model a program flow tree to model a decision tree. Just use a decision tree. This is basically the same as what you have draws but minor notation change. And more importantly no suggestion that this is what the program looks like. Imagine writing a program from this flowchart that can sort 100 items.,2017-09-28T08:47:01.577,204
8376,3710,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor sometimes the decision tree grows indefinitely and when you remark two situations are similar comes the idea of jumping back to a previous point. Then you recognize a loop. Or a regular infinite tree if you are more mathematically inclined. PS: I dont teach a notation for finished programs but an approach. When you recognize a loop you know what is the condition and what you want to repeat.,2017-09-28T08:52:24.467,2103
8377,3700,0,And a fifth one: `switch`,2017-09-28T08:57:07.523,3137
8378,3697,0,There are cases where you really *need* goto or labelled break. Example :       outer_loop :  for (X x : list_of_X) {                            for (Y y: list_of_Y) {                               if (some_condition(xy)) {                                  do_something_with(xy);                                  break outer_loop;                            } },2017-09-28T09:01:09.887,2103
8379,3711,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor That's just a force-pc with some side effects. Where goto fits as a better analogy is that exceptions are less structured. SVC can be considered a subroutine because it is planned IRQ less so (although it uses an identical mechanism).,2017-09-28T09:05:10.490,41
8381,3700,0,_@Manngo `switch` would involve conditional jumps not particularly unconditional ones (unless you are referring to the `default` at the end?) But in any case there is a philosophical dissimilarity here. By that measure so do `if` statements. The purpose isn't to find every jump that a compiler would generate but rather to find the ones that pull a program out of the narrative flow of the program (which is the use-case that so readily creates spaghetti code),2017-09-28T10:11:02.103,27
8382,3697,0,Well _need_ is relative. You have set up a case in which a targeted break is really _convenient_ but there are other solutions to such a problem. Otherwise Python programmers would be just _stuck_.,2017-09-28T11:13:29.177,1293
8383,3697,0,Nor is a targeted break precisely speaking a _goto_ though easy to explain as if it were assuming your students know about `goto`. But it isn't necessary to explain it as a specialization of a wild _goto_ when they don't.,2017-09-28T11:24:04.767,1293
8384,3715,0,Yes when reading this is realised that as a professional developer I have **sometimes** invented a Domain Specific Language and used that to help me design a program. Because I had not written a compiler for it it was a pseudo-code.,2017-09-28T13:12:15.543,204
8385,3697,0,_@buffy My best effort with a boolean looks like this  `boolean want_to_leave = false; for (int i = 0; ! want_to_leave && i < list1.size(); i++) {   String w1 = list1.get(i);   for (int j = 0; ! want_to_leave && j < list2.size(); j++) {     String w2 = list2.get(j);     if (w1.length() == w2.length()) {       println(w1   w2);       want_to_leave = true;     }   } }`  and doesnt seem much clearer than `outer:  for (String w1 : list1) {   for (String w2 : list2) {     if (w1.length() == w2.length()) {       println(w1   w2);       break outer;     }   } }`.,2017-09-28T13:27:31.980,2103
8387,3699,0,Actually D. Knuth _agreed_ with E. Dijsktra. He just provided a more detailed view with good examples of no-so-easy to remove gotos (with arguments on clarity and optimization: error management n+1/2 loops etc.) and honestly explained he had lot of difficulties to change his programming  habits. Anyway it doesnt hurt to explain that what happens in a program actually turns into ridiculously small things like moving data comparing it and jumping elsewhere.,2017-09-28T13:40:40.073,2103
8388,3711,2,Why is while(true): in any way more sensible? Write down a full explanation of how the two bits of code work. Which is simpler to understand?,2017-09-28T13:42:01.190,3129
8389,3711,0,_@PaulPowell `While (true)` captures the intent not the mechanics of how the code operates. If you look at [tag:coding-style] there are several questions about readability and intent. Professionally readability is the critical thing students need so I think this has to come first. Generally when you start to teach coding the 'how it works' involves a lot of abstraction so using 1980's style doesn't make sense. This question has slightly missed the point in your article that the 'how it works' really is important. To explain how it works `BEQ` `CBZ` are preferable to `GOTO` IMO.,2017-09-28T13:56:54.617,41
8390,3711,2,_@PaulPowell It might be interesting if you ask your question about how control flow teaching is leaving gaps - particularly if you have specific student groups in mind.,2017-09-28T13:59:29.023,41
8394,3704,0,Well @pojo-guy you really should update to COBOL 85 or more recent.   Cobol 74 really was a pain in the *** but since 1985 it has all you need for structured programming : loops if then else and even a very interesting EVALUATE verb much more powerful than the rudimentary switch of C/C++/Java etc :-),2017-09-28T14:07:01.660,2103
8395,3711,1,_@sean I think it is simpler than leaving gaps. It is about a student being able to express themselves in code. Did you try writing down a full explanation of while true?,2017-09-28T14:15:14.283,3129
8396,3711,1,Really awkward leaving comments here as I can only access it on mobile at the moment.,2017-09-28T14:16:32.567,3129
8398,3703,3,I think one of the best reasons to teach `goto` is so that people understand why it's problematic.  Often old bad ideas are recycled in software and it's the people that don't know the old ways that get suckered.  While your at it build an app in VB where all the code is buried in button events.  Then change the requirements.  Same goes for [doodleware](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/02_doodleware.html).,2017-09-28T14:42:14.290,2087
8400,3713,0,I feel this question is lacking a clear definition... Is your Pseudo-Code just a weakly structured language with implicit gap filling? The Arm Architecture defines a formalised Pseudo-Code which is used to completely describe the architecture...,2017-09-28T14:50:19.767,41
8401,2751,0,After reading the comments I was thinking that if you have XOR you can make not because (a XOR 1) = (NOT a). But after watching the video I see the problem. For the domino XOR gate to work you have to knock down the two inputs simultaneously. So for a NOT gate to work someone would have to be standing over the machine knocking down a domino every time the NOT gate was about to be hit in the circuit. This defeats the purpose of an automatic computer.,2017-09-28T15:01:32.640,587
8402,3717,0,Good to know your history of course: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem. You have something nice and tricky but not essential.,2017-09-28T15:33:30.173,1293
8403,3717,1,_@Buffy I guess nothing is essential if you give up on readability. I really like the Single-while-loop folk version of the theorem section from the page you linked even if it addresses an extreme form of what you have to do with control flags (`p` is completely artificial and is only needed because of the shortcomings of the structured flow). I especially like the last quote before the block of code which neatly sums up my PoV.,2017-09-28T15:38:44.177,2038
8404,3717,0,I worry about readability. Suppose that your simple flowchart results in code that is spread over about 5 pages. Is it still readable. The history of computing languages seems to imply that go-to should just go. Python Scala etc don't include it and there are other ways to think than with low level structures. These result in cleaner and more maintainable code. One problem with go-to is that it often results in write-once or even write-only software that is impossible to maintain in the face of changing requirements.,2017-09-28T15:45:56.540,1293
8405,3717,0,For Ruby's support of goto see: http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/2/29/the-joke-is-on-us-how-ruby-1-9-supports-the-goto-statement,2017-09-28T15:46:17.097,1293
8406,3699,8,Yes Dijkstra was a _purist_. He was also extremely arrogant. But he wasn't wrong as I think you are trying to imply. Yes there was controversy about his claims at the time but the paper influenced the development of _every_ later language. It has taken a while to eliminate goto altogether of course but the trend is now nearly complete.,2017-09-28T15:51:20.237,1293
8407,3717,1,A five-page nested loop won't do you any good either so that's a job for another structuring tool (namely functions). Anyway there's no doubt that structured control flow is a benefit in the overwhelming majority of cases. But wanting in the tiny number of cases when it isn't enough to simulate a goto by misusing a control structure is just a bad idea. The tell-tale symptom is the apparition of infinite or do-once loops with `breaks` or the proliferation of control flags. That's not more maintainable code in the slightest compared to a simple labeled `goto`.,2017-09-28T15:57:02.083,2038
8408,3717,0,Hmmm. No one is suggesting misusing other control structures. And yes functions are one of the classic ways to solve many such control issues. Could you imagine suggesting such a control structure to a Scheme programmer? You seem to be insisting that such things are _needed_. They are not. Finding out why and how will expand your horizons I think.,2017-09-28T16:06:23.833,1293
8409,3717,0,For a little more perspective. For replacements of some of these poor control structures a small local change may not do the job resulting in even poorer code and misuse of structures. Sometimes you want to step back and re-think the algorithm. There is likely a clearer simpler more readable more maintainable way to do it. I'd suggest the Gries book mentioned elsewhere here (The Science of Programming) as a good place to learn such things. https://www.amazon.com/Science-Programming-Monographs-Computer/dp/038790641X,2017-09-28T16:11:45.207,1293
8410,3717,0,_@Buffy you can implement it in a functional language by wrapping it in a function and tail-recursing from the first condition. That's not ideal in imperative languages though. As for misusing control structures ending up with loops that don't actually loop or depend on some phantom flag unrelated to the data you're processing or have their condition in a weird place (granted that one is pretty tame) seems definitely off.,2017-09-28T16:11:51.003,2038
8411,3696,2,You are confusing the goto concept with the goto keyword - the latter of which is generally considered bad but that's actually more of a religious objection than a practical one. Every loop every recursion every function call is a GOTO/GOSUB conceptually. We can't program anything without that concept.,2017-09-28T16:14:12.063,1257
8412,3717,0,Procedural languages can do tail recursion as well: The C and C++ specifications allow it but do not mandate it. `gcc` implements it. But tail recursion is no more `goto` than `if` is. It is a `while` with out mutation.,2017-09-28T16:26:10.213,204
8413,3696,0,_@Jasmine the article is advocating direct use of goto that is by using the `goto` keyword. I have said that goto is useful in teaching assembler language (they have branch/jump instructions).,2017-09-28T16:28:47.097,204
8415,3699,2,_@Buffy Dijkstra's paper protects (in part) against [these practices](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/118793/239446).The thing is those practices aren't supported by higher level languages. It was absolutely correct when he wrote it but technology has changed. It's like us sticking with QWERTY. Back when it was designed it made sense. Now it doesn't at all. Obviously I'm not switching to DVORAK anytime soon but can we at least agree that advice from 50 years ago using different technology might not be the gold standard for the technology we have today?,2017-09-28T16:35:42.530,1578
8416,3717,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor it still isn't that idiomatic and might not fit the meaning of the algorithm. Not sure about your comparison with `goto`: tail recursion is equivalent to just jumping back to the beginning of the function while wiping the stackframe.,2017-09-28T16:42:15.323,2038
8417,3717,0,_@Buffy I do make this answer on the premise that this flow *is* the best you can do to model your requirements. I also didn't design it but actually stumbled upon it while writing actual C++ code. I've also been bitten by another case in Java which doesn't have `goto` and left me needing to write a degenerate `do`-loop with `break`s so I could skip to the end.,2017-09-28T16:47:09.187,2038
8418,3717,0,@I can accept that tail recursion is goto when I accept that while and if are goto. Depends how you look at them. I prefer mainly to look at there structure not their implementation. I too have sometimes had to do weird things with goto and flags. I have come to realise that it because the languages we use don't have the higher order structures. Same as in the 1960s we used goto because we did not have the basic structures (whileforif). There are still other higher order structures. If our languages did them then we would not need to do weird stuff.,2017-09-28T17:03:29.950,204
8419,3717,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor yes maybe some new structures would be the solution so we can avoid falling back to `goto` and its caveats. I'm purposefully avoiding the but a `while` is just a `if+goto` in disguise argument because it's moot for the reason you stated. I do invite you though to try implementing that flowchart and then verify that each abstraction and structure you used is actually meaningful -- loops actually loop conditions are about the (imaginary) data you're processing and there's no weird flags floating around. Maybe you'll get a great idea for the missing structure :),2017-09-28T17:11:20.070,2038
8420,3699,11,Dijkstra was right for most cases and purposes. Can I just ask if people criticising the approach have any experience of trying to teach low ability 12 year old children? When I trained to teach my biggest problem is I thought I could just explain things and children would understand. In reality I had been hanging out with the top 10% of the ability range (even in school I had no idea about the struggle of bottom sets.) I also teach year 11 maths and pupils struggle with place and value along with adding negative numbers. It is a different world.,2017-09-28T17:19:59.407,3129
8421,3717,0,_@Quentin I took up this challenge once before when it was a concrete problem. So I could re-write it. But I agree that this abstract problem is not elegantly solved.,2017-09-28T17:25:16.207,204
8422,3704,0,I agree that Evaluate is much more powerful than switch but COBOL is crippled in other ways. Problems that take three lines of java code can take hundreds of lines of COBOL code - for example finding the intersection set of two sets.  Each language expresses different thoughts easily so they are all valuable.,2017-09-28T17:33:22.080,1537
8423,3699,9,_@PaulPowell I have taught exactly one 12 year old to code (although to be fair it was me). In support of what you're saying I was learning TI-BASIC so I learned what a goto was before a for-loop and it made perfect sense. Computers always read the next line of code unless you tell it to jump to a different line instead. Can't get much easier than that. When I got to loops and method calls which implicitly jump around the first thing I'd do was mentally stick the `goto`s in and then they made sense too. I couldn't imagine learning loops first (or god forbid how a stack pointer works).,2017-09-28T17:38:29.853,1578
8424,3712,0,I can't tell what [hacking... is] completely based on jumps not loops is trying to get at.  I would suggest removing your third bullet point or trying to provide evidence for it.  That doesn't match my experience of security.  Are you perhaps trying to hint at ROP attacks?  But that's something entirely different; ROP has to do with CALL/RET instructions and I don't see what the difference between jumps vs loops has to do with it.,2017-09-28T17:43:22.643,1106
8426,3712,0,Anyone analysing malware or looking at vulnerability testing that requires analysis of compiles software will need to dip into assembler. Which means understanding assembler CPU address (+other) stacks (and perhaps interrupts) and so on. Which means understanding code that exclusively uses jumps and branches such as JMP/JEQ/JL/JNE (or whatever the equivalent is on your CPU/SCAD). AKA understanding goto. Crucial for infosec work.,2017-09-28T18:16:28.850,1629
8427,3696,0,Sometimes you don't have a choice.  I taught myself to program on my TI-83 plus calculator with TI-BASIC which didn't have functions so the best you could do was either subprograms (not viable for large numbers of them) or gotos and lbls.  If you really want it to be understood that goto creates problems then yes you should teach it and illustrate the problems.  Have them debug or describe code that makes liberal use of goto.,2017-09-28T18:23:44.680,1387

8432,3723,0,These actually are CS majors; this is a discrete math course for CS majors. I edited my question for clarity.,2017-09-28T19:56:02.230,587
8433,3722,1,I think I get what you're saying. A student would have to use the algebra rules to try to find an equivalent expression. A particularly stubborn student might still use two truth tables to prove that the rewrite is equivalent to the original.,2017-09-28T19:58:26.483,587
8434,3719,0,You're right; I need to consider what my learning goals actually are. I think I have two reasons for teaching this practice: (1) manipulating logical expressions is a common activity in computer programming and (2) practice with algebra of any kind helps with the mental skill of mathematical abstraction.,2017-09-28T20:11:11.103,587
8435,3718,0,Discussing simple circuits (gates) might also give some an incentive to do more ... but don't teach them about Karnaugh maps or you have given them another reason *not* to mess about with Boolean algebra! [/devil].,2017-09-28T20:27:28.843,1352

8437,3712,0,That's an argument for eventually teaching students assembly language at least if they want to do infosec reverse engeering.  That's not the same as an argument for teaching goto.  And it has nothing to do with jumps vs loops.,2017-09-28T22:08:46.733,1106

8441,3724,1,Hey MuffinMan! Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2017-09-29T01:06:24.563,58
8442,3719,3,Yet in the workplace if you presented boolean algebra math to prove something most people will not understand it.  I don't care if the truth table has 1000 rows; everyone can understand that!  And if you have a problem that has EIGHT variables then it's time to break the problem down to smaller bits... god be damned if I were to look at an SQL statement with 8 joins or an if statement with 8 conditions.,2017-09-29T02:30:41.203,1285
8443,3696,2,Look at it from the other end of the telescope:: Language features like if-then-else while loops break and continue keywords in loops case constructs catch-throw exceptions function calls recursion etc etc are just syntactic sugar to avoid using that nasty G-word (and in some instances to avoid explicitly using a stack as well). Of course you can use the G-word for other programming purposes as well as the ones where the language designers gave you a sugar-coated alternative - and some of them are perfectly good ways to write code in real life but others are not!,2017-09-29T02:42:32.390,1352
8444,3719,6,_@Nelson -- I disagree with the claim that most people in a workplace don't understand basic boolean algebra laws. If a dev doesn't understand things like De Morgan's law or laws like `(a && b) && c == a && (b && c)` or `(a || !a) == true` then they're grossly incompetent and should never have been hired full stop. I'm also not sure why you have prove in scare quotes. Applying boolean algebra laws is a perfectly valid proof strategy as is generating a truth table.,2017-09-29T03:01:44.550,732
8445,3697,0,_@Buffy have you actually USED Fortran in the 20 years or so? You do realize it now even has classes? - plus a whole range of other structured features of course. Sure there are one or two things that still *need* the concept of gotos and statement labels (like low-level error handling in I/O statements) but those are very much a minority - and of course you can (and should!) encapsulate the low-level I/O in its own classes and/or modules so the implementation is invisible to the rest of the program! Teaching people Fortran IV is about half a century out of date now.,2017-09-29T03:03:12.743,1352
8446,3719,6,_@Nelson -- Also regarding truth tables not scaling if you have many variables: are you familiar with the SAT problem as well as SAT solvers SMT solvers and the like...? They're pretty useful and come up in several subfields of CS/software engineering -- it turns out the SAT problem is NP-complete and SAT solvers can do a pretty good job of efficiently finding solutions in most (though not all) cases. When you're taking your domain-specific NP problem and converting them into propositions to feed to your SAT/SMT solver it's not uncommon to generate thousands or millions of variables.,2017-09-29T03:05:20.037,732
8447,3725,0,And your experience of delivering this knowledge to 28 mixed ability 11 year olds is?,2017-09-29T07:18:32.633,3129
8448,3722,0,Yes you could use a truth table to check the answer is correct. Therefore you could find the answer by brute force guessing and checking. If they are that stubborn then you need a question that has too many possible answers and a large truth table they are both correlated so $O(n^2)$. You should find (as long as you have done nothing to annoy the student to make them stubborn) that they are not stubborn they are just pragmatic. Truth tables are easier and sufficient oh now they are not I now see why boolean algebra may be of use.,2017-09-29T07:44:07.967,204
8449,3725,0,_@PaulPowell  Teaching goto is not the problem. It may even be easier that teaching structured programming. But then you have a class full of pupils that need to be un-taught. I have been in gilles position and have had people on my team that have been taught these bad habits. It can take longer to un-teach them than it took you to teach them. Use scratch as a basis (this is taught to 7 year olds) then have them translate scratch programs into python (see https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/178/204 ). Both languages do not have `goto`.,2017-09-29T08:05:46.113,204

8453,3719,3,_@Michael0x2a A lot of my completely competent colleagues of mine throughout the years would have had no ideas about De Morgan's law... and yet they were able to program things of amazing complexity. That's the thing sure a law like that can save you a couple of seconds or give marginally clearer code but in the end 99.99% of real world programming has nothing to do with that. So calling those types of programmers incompetent and not worth hiring is beyond naive and rude showing a complete lack of understanding of the real world.,2017-09-29T11:22:50.893,675
8454,3722,0,_@psmears Anyway we won't use them with functions with more than 10 arguments so it is reasonable to use them to compare (by computer) if 2 combinatorial circuits have the same behaviour and who where the differences are. Just print the (first) lines  where they differ.,2017-09-29T11:27:33.823,2103
8455,3719,0,In a programming-teaching context you have to convince students that boolean expressions ARE expressions not things that only appear as condition parts of if for while etc. As expressions computations can be done on them and some computations can be simplified/clarified either by case analysis (truth tables) or routine transformations (algebraic laws). Unfortunately De Morgan laws don't really work in this context as evaluation is often left-to-right with some reason `( i==n || t[i] == x)`... so **multivalued logic should be used instead** (sorry for the math teacher :-)),2017-09-29T11:41:39.553,2103
8456,3704,0,_@pojo-guy COBOL has never been intended as a general purpose language it has some dark spots but ir does rather well in its category for a 60y old language.  Remark that COBOLS's `add A to B C D` is much shorter than `B += A; C+= A; D += A;` :-).  Back to the point it allows structured programming.,2017-09-29T11:55:05.350,2103
8457,3717,0,Use the Jacopini method:  1. Give different a block-number to each block. 2. Define a `next_block` variable with initial value 1.  3. replace first action by `if (next_block == 1) { instructions for action 1; next_block = 2 }`. 3. Replace first test (block 3) by `if (next_block == 3) { if (condition1) next_block = 1; else next_block = 4;`. Do the same for all use number 0 for exit. 5. Put it all in a `while(next_block != 0)` loop. 6. Done: structured flowchart where all the logic disapeared and nobody can understand anymore.  That what Dijkstra was referring to.,2017-09-29T12:06:08.550,2103
8459,3704,0,_@MichelBillaud Structured programming is a way of thinking as is object oriented programming. I have done both in BASIC (olde style not what is called BASIC today). COBOL expresses some thoughts more elegantly than other languages and it is still far from dead. Now that it runs on a JVM it will live another 60 years.,2017-09-29T12:24:50.843,1537
8460,3717,0,Seems your flowchart can be written as `action1; aux; action3; while(condition2) { aux; action3;} action4` where `aux` is `action2; while(condition1) { action1; action2} ;`.    (obtained by loop unfolding),2017-09-29T12:26:59.573,2103
8461,3704,0,and it officially has objects since 2002 if you're desperate enough to use it (a lot of my students earn their life in Cobol code maintenance for banks - where the money is- but AFAIK everybody sticks to Cobol 85 no objects).,2017-09-29T12:38:35.943,2103
8462,3711,0,I'd take a guess and say that it might be easier for some coders to grasp programming when there is one action per line (where each line has text) maybe it's easier for them to understand `JMP wherever` instead of `while(condition) {}` (where the brace at the end means go back up to the beginning. When I first started I remember a C `for` loop seemed very daunting and I had a hard time remembering it (e.g.: When do each of these things in the parentheses even run? Once? After the loop? Before it? Both?).,2017-09-29T12:45:35.833,933

8466,3717,0,_@Quentin If it is a problem to have the same code change the names. Well no better idea put the repeated code in a function and call it where it is needed.  Joke aside It is probably a theorem given a finite set of 'flowchart schemes' there are flow charts where gotos cannot be be removed without code duplication or use of extra variable. Should check. So the the point would be : what are the schemes needed for most practical use ?,2017-09-29T13:35:09.530,2103
8467,3717,0,_@MichelBillaud as an anecdote this very scheme popped up while I was implementing a turn scheduler similar to that of HoMM5 which handled a list of actors and had to work with turn skipping reordering etc.,2017-09-29T13:49:35.483,2038
8468,3717,0,_@Quentin It means that a specific structure is needed to express clearly what you need to do which seems to be retrying previous steps.  `#define retry(label) goto label`,2017-09-29T13:56:06.930,2103
8469,3704,0,_@MichelBillaud it has objects but they are skewed from what OO programemrs from other backgrounds think of as objects.  As one language junkie and COBOL guru friend of mine says Object Oriented COBOL is neither Object Oriented nor COBOL but it makes a lot of sense for the right problems,2017-09-29T13:58:17.350,1537
8470,3707,1,_@PeterK.: A specific example: error handling in a C function that took a lock.  [`linux/mm/msync.c`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5924bbecd0267d87c24110cbe2041b5075173a25/mm/msync.c#L103) uses `goto out_unlock;` inside many error-check `if()` clauses.  It implements a system call so all its args are untrusted and there are many return-error cases that are only detected after taking a lock.  It's C so RAII to release the lock isn't an option.  Obviously this applies to any other cleanup task that you don't / can't use RAII for in whatever language.,2017-09-29T14:11:30.847,1654
8471,3707,0,Can also be used for breaking out of a double-nested loop although that's getting into spaghetti territory if done too much.  Some languages have a `break label` for this.  e.g. PERL has [`next LABEL`](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/next.html) for outer loops.  Still possible to abuse though.,2017-09-29T14:14:14.297,1654
8472,3725,1,Real-world example of `goto` for cleanup: [`linux/mm/msync.c`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5924bbecd0267d87c24110cbe2041b5075173a25/mm/msync.c#L103) uses `goto out_unlock;` inside many error-check `if()` clauses.  It implements a system call so all its args are untrusted and there are many return-error cases that are only detected after taking a lock.  It's C so RAII to release the lock isn't an option.  (There are 12987 hits for `goto` in the Linux kernel tree; all like this or `asm goto` as a way of optimizing `if (asm_statement)` to avoid producing an actual boolean.),2017-09-29T14:23:03.093,1654
8473,3719,0,_@DavidMulder -- sure I can concede that some devs might legitimately have never heard of De Morgan's law. But I still stand by the rest of my assertion -- are you really claiming that your co-workers are completely incapable of understanding things like why `(a && b) && c == a && (b && c)` and `(a || !a) == true` are true? I find that extremely hard to believe.,2017-09-29T15:37:05.773,732
8474,3719,0,_@MichelBillaud -- I suppose. That said OP said in their question that this was for an upper division class about specifically discrete math so I'm making the assumption that the students are already familiar and comfortable with programming.,2017-09-29T15:42:16.577,732
8475,3728,0,Hey man happy to have you here but this seems more like a discussion. Come over to the chat room to discuss this. I am going to have to recommend to have this closed. Further the answer to your question is whatever got you interested in the first place. Just say what got you interested. You don't need a community suggested answer for that.,2017-09-29T15:51:36.847,2605
8476,3722,0,_@psmears I didn't expect the Argument Clinic sketch. My point is : the theoretical complexity is a barrier when values of n are sufficiently big.,2017-09-29T15:53:58.063,2103
8477,3719,0,_@Michael0x2a It's one thing to logically understand such a thing another entirely to understand one specific abstracted model from which such logic can be derived. Let me put it this way a decade and a half ago in my early teens I started programming seriously and I am sure I could've reasoned those two things within seconds... yet if I would've opened the Wikipedia page about Morgan's law I would've gotten stuck in literally the first sentence. Personally I never took a computer science education (very intentionally) (cont.),2017-09-29T15:56:55.740,675
8478,3719,0,and the only reason why I have any knowledge about the computer scientific model is because I am naturally curious not because I need it professionally. So yeah boolean algebra is not something I would recommend anybody to use in a professional setting (unless you're doing some very specific type of tasks which are comparatively rare in the real world).,2017-09-29T15:58:34.747,675
8479,3725,2,_@PaulPowell I don't have any experience teaching this to 11 year olds but I have as much industry experience and I'm telling you that your teaching will neither make them better programmers nor make it easier for them to learn. The example you cite from the Linux kernel is an example of the pattern I state as being the only common use case for goto in my world.,2017-09-29T16:36:29.190,124
8480,3719,0,_@DavidMulder -- I'm not sure if I agree with your conclusion. There aren't that many boolean algebra laws and most of them are common sense (for example things like `a && b == b && a`). As a result I think it's very reasonable to expect devs to be able to follow most boolean algebra proofs even if they've never been formally taught the material -- after all all you do is just apply these (mostly) common-sense laws one after the other. That is I claim all you need to follow a boolean algebra proof is the ability to logically understand something as you put it.,2017-09-29T16:52:26.630,732
8481,3719,4,_@DavidMulder -- Regarding De Morgan's law -- sure if a beginner starts with Wikipedia they'd be lost but Wikipedia is pretty obtuse in general. De Morgan's law is usually presented within most intro classes as just two factoids: `!(a && b) == (!a || !b)` and `!(a || b) == (!a && !b)` (and the instructor then spends some class time working through truth tables to convince students why this is the case). So sure I can agree that not everybody might have run into this factoid but I don't think it's some hugely complicated thing a beginner will have trouble understanding.,2017-09-29T16:54:00.487,732
8482,3725,0,Firstly the Linux comment wasn't made by me. Secondly If you have no experience of KS3 education then what apart from the height of arrogance compels you to presume it works how you think it does?,2017-09-29T17:12:18.330,3129
8483,3696,1,There is always value in teaching flow charts at least in my opinion. (Disclosure: I am not an educator just a programmer :) ),2017-09-29T17:40:03.237,3165
8484,3728,0,While the question is quite different from what we normally see here the issue of motivating students through faculty connection is a valid one for any educators site. However the issue is broader than just _CS_  education of course. However newer teachers may need to know where they should try to place themselves on the formal to informal scale in dealing with students. So I think advice from the community is valid and valuable.,2017-09-29T18:23:22.280,1293
8485,3696,0,_@Restioson your comment has no information except that you have an opinion. Can you elaborate?,2017-09-29T18:48:10.410,204
8486,3725,0,If you think it's just a jump you don't understand goto  Wow well aren't you a gate keeper?  We don't need this kind of language on any Stack Exchange site especially not a site for educators with the explicit purpose of making CS education better.    Always *always* explain after statements if you think X your are wrong.  If you don't all you've said is I think I know something you don't and I just wanted to let you know that and I really hope I don't have to explain what is wrong with that statement.,2017-09-29T20:36:15.693,3168
8487,3725,0,_@snb I recommend that you read my answer not just one sentence. I *do* explain why goto isn't just a jump.,2017-09-29T20:44:29.980,124
8488,3727,1,Generated programs are a radically different beast from code that humans maintain. Most (I hesitate to say all but I can't think of a counterexample) state machines I've written in the real world are better written out with an explicit state; conflating program state with program counter location the way you have to do it if you rely on goto for state change would have made them very hard to maintain because the states are not clearly disjoint. Admittedly goto might be the easiest way to express a state machine which is a toy exercise designed to keep the states simple.,2017-09-29T20:51:58.497,124
8489,3725,0,_@PaulPowell By the way your authority argument might conceivably carry some weight if you at any point explained why goto is better suited for 11 year olds than for adults (undergrads and up).,2017-09-29T20:55:20.737,124
8490,3725,0,_@Gilles No you don't explain why it isn't a jump you state  It's a jump to a different context  and no underneath it would still be a jump regardless with semantic rule control in the compiler if you're in a language like C++ goto is a jump.   You seemed to want to find a way to display arrogance when what you actually should have said is Goto isn't dangerous because you jump to another point in a program its dangerous because that jump to a completely different context in the program. The invariants that ....  with out your gate keeping statement.,2017-09-29T20:59:14.263,3168
8491,3727,0,_@Gilles - There are of course good ways and bad ways to organize state-machine goto code (believe it or not) just like any other kind of code. But you aren't fixing that by artificially imposing an unnecessary loop-switch structure on top of it.,2017-09-29T21:23:25.413,1139
8492,3727,1,My point is that the state machines I usually see are a loop around *something that contains a switch or at least a bunch of conditionals*. The loop body is hardly ever *just* a switch. It tends to be something like: read and parse a message run consistency checks analyze the state update some data structures emit a log message make a state transition loop. That's hard to express with goto statements even in the best of cases where ?€?analyze the system state?€? only comes up once.,2017-09-29T21:37:21.457,124
8493,3712,0,_@D.W. I think that by ?€?goto also has considerable importance in security/vulnerability?€? Stilez means ?€?goto is important to write native exploits?€?. Which is true as part of the more general fact that writing native exploits requires a very good understanding of how a machine executes a program. But teaching how to write exploits is not relevant to  the context of the question which is teaching to fairly novice students (the author of the article seems to insist that it's especially relevant for middle school students).,2017-09-29T21:41:21.000,124
8494,3712,0,By the way the statement ?€?at a low level there are no loops only conditional and unconditional gotos?€? is partly wrong (some processors do more than that for you e.g. they manipulate the stack and conversely a jump can actually be *more* than a goto if it involves changing processor modes). It's also misleading because even in microcontroller programming very little code is written in assembly and goto is rarely used in C let alone higher-level languages.,2017-09-29T21:45:40.200,124
8495,3725,0,_@Gilles if you teach undergrads then you are looking at worst at the brightest 50% of the population. Imagine your brightest undergrad and your absolute dimmest. Now imagine someone who is that much less able again. Now imagine all of them have six or seven fewer years of being educated. To put you in the picture I spent 5 minutes today with a Y11 student exploring different ways he could attempt the sum 21/3. He is at the bottom of the range and although he eventually could do it today he will have the same problem tomorrow the day after and probably for the rest of his life.,2017-09-29T22:01:12.347,3129
8496,3725,0,Difference enough for you?,2017-09-29T22:01:36.903,3129
8497,3725,0,_@PaulPowell I'm well aware that teaching to Y11 is vastly different from teaching to undergrads. What I fail to see is why goto would be more appropriate to Y11. It's a very complicated concept. Why on earth would you teach the more complicated concept to middle schoolers?,2017-09-29T22:19:42.027,124
8498,3727,0,_@Gilles -  If there's really a significant amount of always run code yes that's a good reason for a loop. However I tried that for a while with my first serious manual lexer and gave it up. The problem is that stuff outside the switch tends to end up only running at the end or beginning of *most* loops not all of them (practical example: don't bother updating the lexeme in comment state.) After about the 3rd interlocking exception you end up just making that stuff subroutines and calling them at the end of the states that need it. That's much easier to follow code.,2017-09-29T22:24:22.277,1139
8499,3728,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. This seems like a good discussion to have and I'm sure that there could be some good questions generated from either that discussion or this question. As written however this is more an invitation to share experiences than a _question_ looking for __an__ _answer and is too broad for the Stack Exchange format. Have a look at the [Tour](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/tour) and the [Help Center](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/help) to get a better idea of how things work here compared to most other forum sites.,2017-09-30T00:52:27.357,104
8500,3719,0,_@Michael0x2a I'd be concerned about the opposite.  While I agree that I'd expect a developer to be able to understand that `(a && b) == !(!a || b)` the real question would be if someone made a mistake with said logic would the developers be able to catch it in a code review?  That's a much harder question.  (And a funnier one too.  You'll know it when you get it!  It was actually quite unintentional),2017-09-30T01:56:28.657,812
8501,3719,0,_@CortAmmon -- well that's what things like unit tests code coverage analysis mutation tests fuzz tests and the like are for right? To catch accidental errors like that one. But yes typos can be hard to catch in general. I'm not sure what that fact has to do with boolean algebra in particular? (I also note that correctly applying boolean algebra is likely to *reduce* bugs -- after all if you simplify an expression it'll be easier for somebody else to reason about and verify.),2017-09-30T03:18:23.263,732
8502,3716,1,There's lots of boolean algebras that aren't just on the set {True False}. e.g. take a big square-free number; then its divisors form a boolean algebra where conjunction is lcm and disjunction is gcd. The truth table approach can easily be made unapproachably tedious (or even infinite!) with a careful choice of boolean algebra.,2017-09-30T05:20:54.367,3171
8503,3719,0,_@Michael0x2a To catch an error like that a developer not only needs to understand that laws like DeMorgan's work but to be able to apply them subconsciously and see that a piece of code just doesn't smell right.,2017-09-30T05:24:06.210,812
8504,3719,0,The thing is I'll rather put a truth table in a requirements document than expect a client to understand boolean algebra.  I can walk through the truth table automate the unit tests and tell them right then and there whether my code meets the requirements.,2017-09-30T05:34:25.820,1285
8505,3725,0,First I said year KS3 is where I am doing this not Y11. I gave a Y11 example it illustrate where the bottom of the ability range is although if I were required to teach this child CS I may well use GOTO. You might be theretically aware but try going to a local non-selective comprehensive and teaching a class (not a selected group) of year 7s. Then try the same thing in London.,2017-09-30T08:00:55.030,3129
8506,3725,0,The whole article and everything else says that this is an experiment so I don't know if they will find it easier yet as we are just getting started.,2017-09-30T08:02:11.823,3129
8507,3725,0,You are asking me to say what is simple about goto (which is always harder than saying why it is complicated). Two things first: one line one sttatement one action for all statements. Secondly context is pretty much irrelevant at this stage - about the worst you could do is reference a variable before it has been defined. Thirdly they don't have to think about what is in and outside the loop - just what happens next. We are using BASIC 256 as our language. Now you tell me what is so complicated about this.,2017-09-30T08:20:41.233,3129
8508,3696,0,_@ctrl-alt-deor oh I'm sorry I accidentally left that out I guess. Essentially I see great value in being able to reconcile code with the flow of your program and being able to visualise it like that. It's an exceptionally useful debugging tool too - whenever I have mangled or wrong output I mentally step through my program like a flowchart to see what's gone wrong,2017-09-30T09:11:25.650,3165
8509,3712,0,This isn't hard to understand. C wont help you nor is it about writing exploits. Example paper: malware analysis of stuxnet: https://www.codeproject.com/KB/web-security/StuxnetMalware/Stuxnet_Malware_Analysis_Paper.pdf . Among the earliest pages (bottom of p.6) is _ at the place of the entrypoint of the unloaded module stuxnet writes a jmp instruction_. `jmp`. That's effectively `goto`. Is there any value in teaching goto? Evidently yes if analysing malware or you won't be able to do so.,2017-09-30T09:37:44.490,1629
8510,3696,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Not to be flippant (well a little) but what is `IF THEN ELSE` but a giant Go-To? As in: **Step-Skipper**?

8512,3722,0,_@somebody You are right psmears is right and  I should have started by anyway whatever the theoretical complexity it can be handled (by student written programs) in such practical cases with only a few (<= 10 or 20) variables.  3 methods : truth tables by hand algebraic transformations case exhaustion by program.,2017-09-30T16:17:58.937,2103
8513,3696,0,_@GwenKillerby I have added a link to one of the copies of the paper. You are correct `if` `then` `else` `while` `for` etc all use `goto` however Dijkstra's argument was that these are some safe ways to use `goto`. We call it structured programming. I and others would argue that this is not enough that conditionals and mutation are also a problem but like `goto` they can be tamed with appropriate structures. I use conditionals and mutation very little and have an intuition an how to use them well. As a consequence my code have very few bugs.,2017-09-30T16:53:06.347,204
8514,3722,0,I am not making any sense of the last few comments so can not tell if you have made any sense of mine. What I am saying is that if you get students to do the type of question in my answer then the complexity of `repeat until I get it correct: guess an answer draw up truth table compare` should be enough to discourage this approach. This is $O(2^n)$ for the truth table ?? $O(?)$ for the guesses which is quite a lot.,2017-09-30T17:00:51.337,204

8516,3731,1,I agree with you completely. However too many teachers are assigned such courses when they are not ready at all. But if you are going to get training get something that doesn't just help you keep a day ahead of the students.,2017-09-30T20:07:51.720,1293

8518,3731,0,Yes. Can you develop that into a complete answer here? Such a plan might require the backing of some organization behind it i'd guess.,2017-09-30T20:17:57.833,1293
8519,3679,0,Currently NY does not have any certification requirements for CS. Discussions have started about creating a certification program and one of the State Universities of NY (Albany) has something for new CS teachers. This is all very preliminary so I didn't want to give out any specifics. In planning to design propose such a program a group of educators was asking each other precisely the question I posed here.,2017-10-01T02:46:04.733,2197
8520,3679,0,_@Jay  In the U.S. much of the curriculum and teacher preparation is left up to individual states. While the Computer Science Teachers Association has created guidelines and a curriculum framework few States have adopted this. We have a national push for more computer science education without a clear path in place to train teachers for the task. There are many teacher training workshops available but no clear requirements in most states.,2017-10-01T02:52:47.683,2197

8524,3722,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Doing truth tables by hand is quick for <= 4 variables but fastidious enough so students will soon discover the interest of algebraic manipulation of expressions by themselves.  To answer the OP question : yes identities valid in all Boolean algebras (true/false sets bitvectors whatever) can always be proved by truth tables on the basic true/false algebra.,2017-10-01T08:20:52.743,2103
8525,3732,0,I might make more explicit the relationship to other perhaps more familiar algebras. It may not be motivational enough but will probably sparkle curiosity.,2017-10-01T11:18:28.187,1000
8526,3646,0,My first book ever on this subject was Concurrent C - this is not a book about actual C it suggests an extension to C which would implement communicating-processes calculus. This book seems to have inspired Go authors and perhaps Erlang authors (not sure which came first the book or the language). Clojure has implementation of CSP though due to the difference in syntax the similarities aren't immediately apparent.,2017-10-01T11:29:36.843,1000
8529,3480,0,Today it is considered a bad idea to generate HTML on the server before displaying it to client. The typical process involves generating only the data required to render the page but have the page enough JavaScript to be able to render those data.

8530,3482,0,I strongly disagree with the choice of proprietary technology which only really runs on top of another proprietary technology for academic use. (Yes I know there's open-source version of ASPX and Mono but they don't really work...) But even if they did it would be far too easy for students to be led astray and into the non-free world of perpetual hand-holding and hand-twisting performed by large corporations on unsuspecting users.,2017-10-01T13:34:03.943,1000
8531,3455,1,C# is a disaster of a language and surely not a good fit for introducing concepts like objects (it would be a great example of how to overcompilcate drown in inconsistencies and incompatibilites etc.). MSVS is a disaster of a code editor especially the MSBuild part. It completely obfuscates the programming process. It is a miracle that some students master any of the above. But when you say they started with C++ I can't help but to sigh and think this is how we have such bad programmers for the last 40 or so years.,2017-10-01T13:49:24.653,1000
8532,3732,1,Another method to prove identities between truth tables and algebraic manipulation : 1. select the most frequent variable v 2. replace it by 0 apply simplifications prove (recursively) whats left. 3. do the same with v=1. Applying at to the first consensus law : with a=0 `(0 ??? b) ??? (??0 ??? c) ??? (b ??? c) ??? (0 ??? b) ??? (??0 ??? c)` iff  `b ??? (b ??? c) ??? b` and on the other side if a=1  `(1 ??? b) ??? (??1 ??? c) ??? (b ??? c) ??? (1 ??? b) ??? (??0 ??? c)` iff  `c ??? (b ??? c) ??? c`. To prove `b ??? (b ??? c) ??? b` b=0 leads to `0???0` and b=1 to `1???1`.,2017-10-01T16:54:05.380,2103
8533,3715,0,Sometimes I have wondered if pseudocode is actually more useful to students who have learned basic programming rather than complete beginners. To be able to write good pseudocode the programmer needs to be able to pinpoint the appropriate level of abstraction which is something beginners have a hard time doing.,2017-10-01T21:18:54.333,3187
8535,3725,0,I upvoted. I am a retired software engineer who learned programming using BASIC in 1981. Basic's `GOTO` was the *most confusing* part of trying to learn how to program and I had real trouble with control flow in more complex programs until I encountered structured control flow in Pascal ca. 1985. I later programmed quite a bit in assembly language even microcode where understanding the concept of GOTO is useful. My programming teaching experience is limited to being a TA at university. Based on that: GOTO is an *advanced* concept that should be kept away from beginners learning a HLL,2017-10-02T02:07:37.470,1940

8539,3696,0,goto *can* be helpful in languages such as C to avoid repeating oneself in error handling code where its scope handling provides a legitimate advantage as well as in escaping multiple nested loops.,2017-10-02T04:22:14.843,3189
8540,3734,1,I don't think your description of the difference between `for` and `while` actually describes what happens in any reasonably popular language. These are just some used-to-be macros that due to historical reasons made their way into some programming languages. But there isn't really anything that warrants this particular number of kinds of loop keywords (some languages have more some have less).,2017-10-02T06:25:35.970,1000
8541,3734,0,What language? (python `for` in much like C# `foreach`),2017-10-02T08:35:39.903,204
8542,3734,0,The for loop (in C-ish languages) is here to give a clear separation between the control and the code to be executed at each turn. Then it leads to idiomatic forms like the well-known  `for(int i=0; i<n; i++)` or `for(char *p = str; *p; p++)` that every programmer recognizes without thinking. Can be done with `while` but the `i++` part would be hidden far away. So the preference of the students for `for` over `while` relies on their ability to abstract the control part from the repeated part. Takes some time and exercises with usual structures like do sthg for x between min and max.,2017-10-02T08:38:47.340,2103

8550,3734,0,_@SeanHoulihane I added it because some of the previous commenters felt that language played a role. If there's a broader language tag that would be more appropriate that's fine too.,2017-10-02T12:00:44.600,830

8556,3738,0,_@PeterTaylor I agree you should teach them to use `java.math.BigDecimal` for real money calculations. The use of such objects in the `for` loop is left as a funny exercise to the reader.,2017-10-02T16:56:49.307,2103

8558,3696,2,Last flowchart I did was in 1979 and I never had much faith in them even when I was taught them in 1971. For a start they reduce every non-trivial and trivial action or decision to the same sized box. For another thing they draw on graphic skills that CS students tend not to have: at least I didn't. There is no harm and indeed a considerable necessity in teaching `JMP` but `goto` as a language construct has certainly seen its last hurrah.,2017-10-03T09:38:20.533,3202

8560,3738,0,Actually the first example is worse than that. Using floats in any counting situation can easily lead to a classic off by one error. You have to assume that 0.5 is exact (which it likely is) but other very similar situations will fail. Try to count by 0.2 for example up to about 1000.0. (I don't know if that one actually fails but some will). Just as in base 10 1/3 isn't precisely representable many things in base 2 are not.,2017-10-03T10:47:12.153,1293
8561,3738,0,And note that BigDecimal is _arbitrary precision_. But that isn't the same as _infinite precision_. Rounding happens. Good enough for money but not for everything.,2017-10-03T11:24:45.553,1293
8562,3738,0,_@buffy Of course it happens and it has to for money handling applications.

8565,530,1,_@GypsySpelweaver Traversal of strings is also a typical use of the for loop in C.  `for(char *p = s; *p != '\0' p++) { do_something_with(*p); }`.

8579,3742,0,You say 'there are better ways of writing the above' ... 'this prompted a nice discussion'. So you may not have meant that the discussion was about better ways of doing it but if you're presenting some code to introduce a topic (rather than presenting a problem to be solved by the students as I inferred in the Q) showing an example which can be improved upon is often constructive.,2017-10-04T15:47:00.683,41

8581,3747,0,There seem to be two issues conflated in the question. One is structuring a program to be modular the second relates to the concept of pipelining several individual programs. I guess that the question would be equally valid without the STDOUT part. Or maybe you mean to include this as your current teaching example which is not as effective as you want?,2017-10-04T16:30:09.133,41
8582,3747,0,Indeed I try to impress upon them the importance of modularity otherwise I might just say it's OK to create gigantic main() functions with the whole code there (and of course it's impossible to teach something like recursion without resorting to functions). The main issue indeed is teaching the necessity of pipelining the output of a function to another piece of code. They seem to think that somehow once I printf() something the computer understands this is what they mean to return from the function but obviously it doesn't work like that.,2017-10-04T16:36:12.837,3209
8583,3747,0,Maybe you can update the question to identify your process more specifically so questions address the right detail. It's not always easy for people from different places to answer the question you thought you asked! The issue does resonate with my early coding experiences.,2017-10-04T16:42:38.763,41
8584,3747,0,I'm not entirely sure what I should change in the question. Perhaps you'd like me to stress this point of pipelining function outputs to other code?,2017-10-04T16:44:24.920,3209
8585,3747,0,I edited - mostly re-ordering two paragraphs. So I think now you might need to also share the example problem. I have a feeling it might be too similar to your previous examples. If you do `print (f(i)))` then its different to `for (::)i+=f(i); print(i)`,2017-10-04T16:55:45.507,41
8586,3747,1,OK I added a concrete example.,2017-10-04T17:01:12.373,3209
8587,3747,16,Why is this such a long question? Students cannot seem to differentiate between return and printf. Then give an example. Please edit out all the noise. Meanwhile let me share in the answer section what I did to solve this.,2017-10-04T18:13:40.667,2605

8590,3747,5,_@Jay Sorry for the question being so long. I guess it is my style to try to be as thorough as possible and also to point out the context of the issue and what I've tried.

8596,3755,0,Actually for this year I have decided to delay as much as possible introducing printf() to them. Sometimes I will provide code samples where it is used but I did not formally introduce the concept to them. When someone does ask about it I reply in jest that it is a very dangerous concept that made quite a few former students fail the discipline previously (which in a way isn't far from the truth). Unfortunately having seen it in action a few times they've already realized how it works and keep trying to use it.,2017-10-04T22:42:52.960,3209
8597,3740,0,Count numbers from 1 to 10? Next lession: `if` `break` `continue` and count only odd numbers and stop when encounter a cubic number? It feels hard to describe exactly the difference between `for` and `while` if there are no things that have no a priori known size. But user input as hinted below might be a good idea.,2017-10-04T23:07:31.153,2879
8598,3754,1,I think it's overkill.  I think it would be faster and more effective to [*thoroughly clear the words* involved.](http://www.effectivetrainingsolutions.com/wordclearing)  For example actually thoroughly clearing the words return and function and operator rather than taking them for granted as understood.  To the extent that your approach works I think it will be because it conveys the meanings of these words?€?but I think that by explicitly addressing the definitions it could be done faster and more directly.,2017-10-05T00:13:24.420,1103
8599,3748,8,The play-acting idea sounds fantastic. I wonder if it might help to implement `return` by whispering rather than passing a paper? Or alternatively make `print()` write the result on a chalkboard visible to the class (not the actors)?

8602,3747,4,I remember that this was one of my big aha moments. My reasoning for why it was hard to grasp back then was that I was coming to it from BASIC which had no concept of scope. Once I understood scope  the role of return became obvious.,2017-10-05T01:48:00.263,1537

8621,3749,0,This is great and +1 however I would like to make a suggestion for it. Perhaps explaining to the students that computers are dumb and they cannot intuit on their own what to do with things that you display on screen or audio played. Likewise you being the computer for the role-play only understand what is in your computer memory and the paper is your computer memory. Your microphone might hear the shouted answer so I would not even discourage shouting the answer but when they expect you to react they get I'm a PC and not programmed to respond to audio; put it in my computer memory.,2017-10-05T12:14:44.627,1740
8622,3749,0,Further; with my above suggestion inevitably someone will ask Then why don't we just program the computer to understand and use the audio or visual data so it can just pick up on the printf and know what to do? To which you can reply Billions of dollars are spent trying to do that. OCR speech-to-text artificial intelligence; that is required for what you suggest. It is possible but it does not work as well and it eats a massive amount of processing power... when you could just explicitly return this value.,2017-10-05T12:17:37.197,1740
8623,3749,1,It just so happens I do a lot of what you said. I pretend I am a computer and then do literally nothing until I am explicitly told. I can be pretty dramatic at that point to drive home the point that computers are fast efficient but totally just dumb.,2017-10-05T12:23:58.367,2605
8625,3755,0,`Setting a standard that printing only happens in main() may help` I would hesitate to agree with @ctrl-alt-delor... I would say main should call a calculate function which stores `result`... and then sends `result` to a separate function that prints - neither function is main. Then a third function that waits for enter to continue. `main()` `int results(int a int b)` `void printresults(int a)`... separation of concerns. Each block does one thing. 1) Main coordinates 2) results calculates 3) printresults prints... results.,2017-10-05T13:01:24.700,3220

8640,3766,0,Am watching the video and am impressed with what I hear. I was thinking that there is a need for up/down votes for questions. However the approach you are taking of the quiz also marking it self seems better. I wonder if it would be of value to do both. To compare or as an initial score for the question (would it speed up the systems initial learning).

8641,3774,0,Brilliant explanation of command query separation and of naming methods. The only thing that I would add is adjectives for when a method returns a boolean.

8646,3775,0,A bat is not an abstraction of a tennis racket.  Bats and tennis rackets are two different specializations of the same abstraction.  The common abstraction is a thing that you can swing with your arms to send a flying ball back in the direction that it came from.  Bats and tennis rackets both have concrete properties that are unlike each other but which can be abstracted away when we want to talk about what they have in common.,2017-10-05T20:29:49.720,1269

Subroutines-with-side-effects can call side-effect-free-subroutines or subroutines-with-side-effects. print is a subroutines-with-side-effects. main is a subroutines-with-side-effects.

8670,3747,1,I don't have enough rep to answer but one neat idea an early CS professor did was assign groups of students to play the role of function. If your team was called you had to calculate the result. But just calculating it wasn't good enough; if the team calling you needed that result you had to write it down on a piece of paper and return it to your calling team.

8711,3798,0,While not answering the question it does provide some missing (previously implied) context. Where does/could the gain come from? The bit about the teachers motivation is very important. Also embedded software is more common than desktop+server software by at least 5:1.,2017-10-09T08:34:43.947,204
8712,3747,0,It's been over a decade since I taught CS but @MrDuk's professor's technique is exactly what I did to illustrate functions and scope. Get the students off their laptops and have them physically participate in an analogy. It's amazing how well this technique helps stuff sink in. I taught working professionals late in the evening (they were exhausted and had attention issues) so sticking to straight-up lecturing was a recipe for failure.,2017-10-09T11:07:33.077,3269
8713,3766,0,Aren't questions that ask the student to group objects or find an object not belonging to a group already testing abstract thinking? In the end of the day this is what it is: you get a bunch of objects imagine an abstract concept that might fit all of them or most of them--and here you are making abstractions.,2017-10-09T12:54:37.573,1000

8717,3803,1,When at university I represented a peer from Singapore that had lost grades for not using a plural. To the staff member it was obvious that there understanding was poor because it should always be plural. However in Singapore they speak mandarin. Mandarin has no plural/singular. Therefore the pupils English had been assessed not their subject knowledge.,2017-10-09T16:02:21.763,204
8718,1360,0,pojo-guy: That is ignorance. Happiness is not measured by wealth. That is a western concept that is used to enslave the stupid. The most people happy != responsible for own happiness. If that were the case everyone would be doing anything they want which would be anarchy and wouldn't be very happy for most people. We live in social structures and it is the responsibility of everyone in that social structure to support and help everyone else not leech off the ignorant and force them in to some type of slavery(which is what Walmart does as almost every corporation including the government).,2017-10-09T17:48:31.180,1638
8721,3755,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Probably because your short form implies C makes a distinction between functions and procedures which it does not. When you frame it in terms of C it seems like a rule of C (but it's not actually a rule of C hence you are wrong). When you frame it as a general design concept it is correct. However I assume students at this level cannot yet grasp the general design concept (or perhaps even the idea of software design) so it's not useful.,2017-10-10T03:52:25.743,1275
8722,3774,0,_@RonJohn that might not work because: it also doesn't say *return* so it shouldn't return!,2017-10-10T03:55:08.750,1275
8723,3778,1,I imagine you could also solve the first issue by using a more complex function... such as the absolute value (provided they don't yet know it's built in) or vector length.,2017-10-10T04:01:08.340,1275

8728,3774,0,_@RonJohn And if they do not understand the difference between *print* and *return* why do you suppose they understand the difference between it doesn't say *print* so it shouldn't print and it doesn't say *return* so it shouldn't return?,2017-10-10T04:38:58.037,1275

8730,3755,0,_@immibis sorry it is not a rule of C or of many languages. Just a rule that I have picked up that makes programming easier. You can however configure a lint tool to do the checks at least for C++. C++ has the idea of side effect free methods (almost) but the lint tool can be made to be more strict. I would also argue that all examples should be best practice even if you don't teach the best practice directly.,2017-10-10T08:38:08.660,204

8733,3774,0,_@immibis completely flawed logic in that people have been paining for *at least* 32000 years while -- as I wrote -- the whole *raison d'etre* of the **computer** and it's baked into the very name -- is math.,2017-10-10T20:50:24.570,3132

8735,3696,0,structured-programming control structures are not always the clearest way to express the variety of structures you have in mind when programming. An easy example : business application where you have to do a dozen of tests (like field contents is numeric or blank value doesnt exceed something etc.) before doing the real job.  You probably dont have a 12-level intrication in mind.,2017-10-11T10:14:58.033,2103
8736,3696,0,_@MichelBillaud I have worked on very complex systems. I write highly structured code and never go beyond 4 levels of indentation and rarely more than 3. I have heard all the excuses before. You can not untangle spaghetti; If you think spaghetti it is too late. You can not convert it in to structured.,2017-10-11T13:37:14.513,204
8737,3707,0,_@immibis it is a code maintainability problem in say business programming when you have a lot of things to check before doing something. And the list of tests has to change over time. In this case a flat list of tests + break if they fail is much easier to maintain over time.,2017-10-11T15:37:58.863,2103
8738,3696,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I'm impressed by the argument of authority :-) I'm not advocating for spaghetti code. If you have ten things to check before doing some thing better write is as action 1 ; if test1 fails return; action 2 if test2 fails return; .... if test10 fails return; you_can_do_it_now() the code is easier to maintain than multi level imbrication.  That's not unstructured code but structured ideas expressed in a language lacking the proper control structures. Talking about authorities in SP even Disjkstra had his skip and abort statements...,2017-10-11T16:20:48.400,2103
8739,3696,0,_@MichelBillaud I have just noticed in your fist comment: ?€?control structures are not always the clearest way to express the variety of [control] structures?€?. I think you are saying that sometimes even modern languages lack the needed control structures so sometimes we still need to synthesise them with a jump/goto. (see my answer I think I covered this.),2017-10-11T18:01:33.213,204
8740,3797,1,Start with the big picture. Don?€?t make it about coding or wiring diagrams or blinking lights. Make it about helping to change the world. All kids want to change the world. Develop that big picture and then work backwards to the blinking led. A blinking LED is about sustainability and a reduction in the production of greenhouse gases because an LED can appear to be on when it is off. If it is on for half the time and off for half the time then it is saving 50% of the power needed to run it. See: https://iearn.org,2017-10-09T03:59:25.847,3266
8741,3797,0,Don't teach kids to change the world teach them to make it better. All of the problems are caused by change. Some change is good some is bad. Making the world better will involve change but change dose not always make it better.,2017-10-09T08:26:37.227,204
8742,3727,0,_@T.E.D. Create/Use a meta compiler (a compiler compiler). Compilers are allowed to output `goto`s. Any domain specific language should be well structured but may output code that is not intended to be maintained my humans. Every other compiler outputs `JMP` instructions.,2017-10-13T13:00:08.253,204
8743,3816,0,Interesting but this is for USA. I am asking about UK. Also you say you got the knowledge in early 1990s but I am asking about a definitions from a paper written in 2012.,2017-10-13T15:24:07.463,204

8745,3803,0,**Example referred to in the question:** ListBox results returned using the SelectedItem vs *SelectedItems* properties. I leave it to you whether this distinction of singular vs plural is important. How does this translate for people with a language that does not have plurals? Microsoft did not think of that I guess. Too bad that most of the computing technology has been developed by one country but hey that is how it went.,2017-10-13T13:42:13.050,3289
8746,3819,0,What age group are you teaching?,2017-10-13T17:34:05.663,204
8747,3818,1,It would be great if you could expand that a bit. What tool or site do you use to manage the discussions?,2017-10-13T17:44:21.917,1293
8748,3816,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Whilst this may theoretically answer the question [it would be preferable](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.,2017-10-13T18:39:05.833,150
8751,3815,0,So apparently teaching students how to develop computer software isn't even on the radar!,2017-10-13T20:36:10.957,1269
8753,3816,1,The [CSTA Standards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TlX1G3mywqXzNWMVdKX0lTSkU/view) provide a reference implementation of the Framework. They're worth a look.,2017-10-14T07:14:08.880,44
8754,3815,1,_@jameslarge why do you say that? Programming comes under computer science.,2017-10-14T08:38:01.817,204
8755,3824,0,this gives another point of view ?€?Foundations/Applications/Implecations?€? as opposed to the view in the question ?€?CompSci/IT/Digital Literacy?€?. I think I have a pretty good idea of what should be in and out. But I would like to know for the examples in the question where they fit in (or not).,2017-10-14T08:51:46.177,204
8756,3824,0,I would argue that none of ?€?big data Page Rank Big Table / GFS?€? are ?€?underpinning principles of computer science?€?. But exploring them could lead to exploring the ?€?underpinning principles of computer science?€?. (What is GFS?),2017-10-14T08:54:53.210,204
8757,3815,2,Sure.  Computer scientists need to know how to program and so do software developers.  But programming is a low-level skill--slightly above learning to type.  The difference between computer science and software development is the difference between being the one guy (or one of two guys) who dreams up and proves the merits of an algorithm like [page rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) and being a member of the (possibly huge) team who turns it in to a robust reliable mutable(_long list of desirable qualities elided for brevity_) service that can be used by millions of people.,2017-10-14T12:27:21.770,1269
8758,3815,0,_@jameslarge 1st if you have a huge team then it will take longer: apparently the android facebook app was developed my a very large team and is bigger than most operating systems. But does very little in comparison. 2nd the role of programmer that you describe is from the 1960s it has been replaced by a bit of software called a compiler. If there are people on your team that are not what you call software developers then drop them from the team.,2017-10-14T14:48:59.113,204
8759,3815,2,It's a fair criticism that the English curriculum focussed much more on computer science than software engineering. This might be because most of those involved were computer scientists rather than software engineers or it might be because our focus was on what all should learn as part of a general education rather than what some should study as vocational training. By analogy we teach all children physics we teach few if any e.g. mechanical engineering.,2017-10-14T19:03:33.653,44
8760,3716,0,Your final question is intriguing. Booleans have some deep properties. See for example: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook?€?Levin_theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook?€?Levin_theorem). I doubt you were trying to get to situations where that would apply but it is worth a look.,2017-10-14T19:56:54.147,1293
8762,3791,0,I like the analogy to a biology or chemistry lab section. In the lab session though there are often reflective questions a student must answer to show that they have an understanding of what they did. I remember writing endless lab reports explaining why my results meant something. What are examples of those reflective questions for Arduino projects?,2017-10-14T20:31:32.147,2045
8765,3838,0,Simple but I like it!  What better way to show the difficulties that students might otherwise gloss over?,2017-10-18T04:54:34.003,1015
8766,3837,0,I agree this is a very important point and I will use it to deepen the exercise during the teacher (me) demonstration stage.  Thanks!,2017-10-18T04:57:30.640,1015

8769,3840,6,This sounds like a good way to totally confuse yourself. You might look here for some general advice: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/1111/1293. Python and JavaScript have different underlying structure. It might be best to build a foundation in one or the other first.,2017-10-18T13:31:24.070,1293
8770,3840,1,Could the down voters and close voters please leave a comment to explain why. Closing a question without explanation is rude. And could lead to @redshift running away fast.,2017-10-19T08:37:52.673,204

8775,3844,0,_@Buffy Yes true novices. I've updated my question.,2017-10-19T14:35:29.260,830
8777,3840,2,I'm also puzzled by the close votes.  This question certainly seems topical to me.,2017-10-19T18:55:32.193,27
8778,3844,0,I would say one reason I never did pre-planning for programs in college was that we were never given programs hard enough to require it. Most were small programs to teach a principle or algorithm.,2017-10-19T22:30:23.010,1402

8782,3847,0,This is fantastic! I appreciate this approach particularly the in-class guidance and pair programming that then leads to a lab. I feel like this is what I have been missing this integration - we do one example in class another in lab another for an assignment. In response to your comment about when to teach this I might ask a different question about that.,2017-10-20T16:24:02.460,830
8783,3849,0,If a student asks a question using one of these mechanisms do all the other students automatically see it and your answer?,2017-10-20T17:58:27.523,1293
8784,3848,1,At on of the answerers on you other question I am sorry if you interpreted the answers this way. I said nothing about critical thinking and for planning I only said that there should not be too much planning. Start with none and build it up. However I did say that some people do too much planning; Planning should be useful. I had a section in my answer to the other question **The value of planning** that (partly) answers this one.,2017-10-20T18:03:27.327,204
8785,3095,0,_@seanyt123: Well there is a proposal for Science Educators https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/113414/science-educators .You may want to support it. There is also Mathematics Educators https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/ ; your question is about mathematics too.,2017-10-20T18:13:57.363,160
8786,3849,0,That's the reason I tried Slack this year. I thought that having a public space for questions would work better than it has. Only a few students ask me questions on Slack and they typically DM me instead of posting publicly. If it's a good question though I'll post my response on the public side so that everyone can see it.,2017-10-20T19:23:55.770,30
8787,3848,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Nope didn't mean to be critical! The answers just challenged me to reconsider whether such skills should even be taught at all and if so where in the curriculum. I personally think they should and early but wanted to solicit thoughts from others particularly if there is any research on the matter.,2017-10-20T20:23:57.497,830
8789,3840,0,I have not voted to close (if I had the question would be closed) but I believe the close voters rationale was that the question is about programming more than teaching. I personally think that it's related to teaching and should be left open.,2017-10-22T14:47:03.910,58
8794,3860,1,This comment isn't worth a full answer but I wouldn't try to convince anyone to join any field based on perceived economic effects. The world changes and students will face different situations than we now see. It is much better for those who can manage it (not everyone I realize) to _Do What You Love_. CS makes them better thinkers. Better thinkers have an advantage in any world. You can be happy and poor. You can also be miserable but rich.,2017-10-23T20:16:54.433,1293
8795,3860,0,+1000 to what @Buffy just said. Don't use statistics to excited people about CS. Use examples of the cool stuff they can create the fun projects they can work on the problems they can solve.,2017-10-23T20:40:47.903,2068
8796,3860,2,_@Buffy There's been a recent discussion on Twitter that focusing on CS only for reasons of interest and passion is a privileged position. https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/921336589581766656 . I think that many low-income students are looking for well-paying jobs to help improve their family situation. But of course if a job can be both high-paying and fulfilling that's the best.,2017-10-23T21:14:36.180,2045
8797,3860,0,I will type a full answer with sources later but have to leave for now. The short answer is it probably won't hurt but whether it'll help is kinda dodgy. Women tend to state varied reasons for joining or not joining STEM fields and this doesn't factor into the most prominent ones. Also these stats can be a tad misleading for various reasons despite being a neat recruiting tool.,2017-10-23T23:58:37.277,3326
8798,3860,2,Some of it is know your audience of course. Female-identified people make up around half the population after all middle class girls low-income girls minority girls immigrant girls and so on are all going to have varying needs and priorities.,2017-10-24T00:01:00.213,3326
8799,3860,1,I don't see any reasons not to share the stats. I think they'd only be a problem if that was all you talked about.,2017-10-24T00:36:05.333,283

8804,3871,1,`int(eval(aString))` is very dangerous if `aString` comes from user input. It will allow the user to execute arbitrary code.,2017-10-26T13:09:41.270,204

8807,3869,0,Let me note that the video referenced has at least a couple of fatal flaws. At one point the order of suggested operations on pointers is backwards leading to a loss of the tail of the list. This could be incredibly misleading to a student who is careful to follow the explanations carefully.,2017-10-26T15:06:08.360,1293

8826,3881,7,I will have to dig up the answer but a question like this was asked previously.  The comments and answers pointed towards a study where one professor created a test to determine whether you will ever get it or not.  He showed evidence that it was a good test.  Many years later he came back and said I'm sorry.  I claimed the test worked.  It in fact did not.,2017-10-30T23:23:58.800,812

8829,3871,0,I think this might also be well coupled with a lesson on writing good specifications is hard.  You don't really get a sense for just how hard it is until many years into programming but you can at least explain that spec writers have to make tradeoffs.  This might be well coupled with ctrl-alt-delor's example of `int(36/5)` which starts to show how hard it can be to draw the line on functionality.,2017-10-31T00:33:05.080,812

8835,3882,32,This is also lacking any kind of evidence. You may *think* ?€?that students who don't learn either have little desire to learn or have had poor teaching in the past?€? but can you actually back that statement up with some kind of evidence? I have read evidence contrary to that statement and while it was far from ironclad proof of any kind I think this question desperately needs more than generalities and possibly-wishful thinking.,2017-10-31T03:52:11.780,1246

8839,3881,1,In a proper University the professors would *completely* ignore your UI and would rather focus your implementation of an ADT or your implementation of an algorithm. As that is what they ask you for the assignments is it not? Maybe a good idea is to separate a text-based UI library like you have above that you re-use every time you submit an assignment. Make sure your Professor is OK with that though you most most likely will not earn extra points for it. Then again cops aren't enrolled to Universities huh?,2017-10-31T06:56:08.187,3359

8854,3881,0,Since this has more to do with your example than your actual question I am leaving it as a comment. Could your student understand the code rewritten in plain English? For example: *Suppose I was given the integer negative one. While any integers I am given are less than one and greater than five I will state Please enter a number from one to five. and then I will request an integer.* If she could understand this then there may be an element of the syntax that is confusing her.,2017-10-31T13:42:13.173,7
8856,3889,3,I disagree with the notion that a teacher (of X) should be advising a student to not study X (arguments can be made if the student is not their student; but that is not the case here). You mention the possibility that the OP isn't a good teacher; which is exactly why he shouldn't suggest that the student quits the study he might end up discouraging someone while the fault lies with the OP.,2017-10-31T14:34:54.993,2164

8860,3883,7,My experience as a dev (mainly teaching interns/juniors but also as a quest teacher at our local uni) is that you hit the nail right on the head. The comparison with musical ability is spot on in my view. I tend to give these students the same tough love my guitar teacher gave me: If you like it by all means continue but I would look elsewhere for a career if I where you. Maybe they will learn 'eventually'  and with 'enormous difficulties' but the student you described in your question will never get hired here as we value 'learning speed' over actual knowledge.,2017-10-31T15:26:16.237,3367
8863,3889,3,That's not really the point. Whether OP phrases it rudely or kindly it still ends up discouraging the student who may simply have been subjected to a bad teacher in the past.,2017-10-31T15:40:45.160,2164
8866,3881,2,I want to chime in and agree that this is badly-written code (it makes the reader think unnecessarily hard) and thus I can?€?t help but empathize with the student. It could be rewritten into pseudocode that shows its intent more clearly: `int answer; repeat { ?€? } until (answer ??? [1..5])`. The confusing initial value of `answer` vanishes and the postcondition of the loop is immediately clear. I might wager that the student *would* get this pseudocode ?€? and in that case the student is hardly at fault Java and/or the author of the code is.,2017-10-31T17:09:19.450,3368
8867,3881,0,Of course badly-written code occurs in the wild and understanding it is a vital skill when programming in the ?€?real world?€?. But it is hardly *essential* to understanding computer science and such code should not play a role in the assessment of someone?€?s comprehension of the basics of CS.,2017-10-31T17:17:17.903,3368
8868,3881,14,_@Lynn I agree that the code could be clearer but it's still not deeply complex. After how many course hours of study in Java would it still be reasonable for someone to be unable to follow this snippet code imperfect though it may be? 20? 100? 500? 10000?,2017-10-31T17:34:20.247,27
8870,3896,1,Did I just read that some teachers are using ?€?Fixed mindset?€? as a disability label. ?€?They have a fixed-mindset that is why **they** don't learn (it is not my fault).?€?. Oh the irony: that attitude is so fixed mindset.,2017-10-31T18:49:04.660,204

8874,3886,18,_@kubanczyk -- come on don't be factious the answer isn't saying science doesn't work or anything silly like that. Rather this answer is saying that regardless of what the predicted value is the best thing for the educator to do is to help all students to the best of their ability. So since the predicted outcome doesn't (or at least shouldn't) influence how you teach and since prediction is difficult why expend effort worrying about it?,2017-10-31T20:02:11.777,732
8875,3883,6,+1 for wiring. I don't have so many data points (only ~20) but I once taught Intro to Programming for non-CS Majors easily the most challenging course I ever taught ?€? not because the material was hard but because so many students found it hard to grasp basic concepts. There were three groups in the class: the naturals who programmed with ease from Day 1; the lost who struggled with *Hello World* and struggled even more mightily as the course progressed; and the learners who struggled at first but eventually turned a corner. (Only one of my students that term was a learner.),2017-10-31T20:42:02.287,1824
8878,3884,6,I agree that there are wrong languages for teaching programming.  However if it were possible to develop a right language that would permit anybody to learn to program I'd expect the past half-century of looking for it would have produced at least some hint of success.,2017-10-31T21:38:45.390,2781

8882,3884,4,Sure it have not existed? What about pascal or python?

8884,3884,3,If the code snippet was using some obscure part of Java then that could definitely be true.  However this is simple enough that anyone who understands a while statement should be able to answer it.

8885,3895,0,You have a more serious problem if your students need instructions on how to start Idle for every lesson. That's like starting every math lesson with a review of the base-10 number system or every reading assignment with a review of the alphabet.,2017-11-01T14:24:26.520,1111

8888,3811,0,Flip the classroom.  All readings etc. are to be done out of class.     Use your LMS (or a free shell hosted by a vendor like Canvas) to host a discussion for questions/answers related to readings so concepts etc can get clarified.  Students should then come to class time ready to work on labs/projects where they can get immediate help from both their peers and you the instructor (or TA or whatever other role is available).,2017-11-01T16:38:27.800,662

8890,3881,0,_@BenI. 2-3? couple more at a stretch?  I'm not a Java programmer myself but all the topics needed are covered by the 6th page of the language tutorial on cplusplus.com.  assuming that each CS class your student has done (class!=lesson right?) does cover some programming I would have thought this would be prior knowledge.  My degree course intentionally avoiding a language that (m)any would have used (no coding requisite) reached this point in the first lecture. (I am aware that this isn't degree level),2017-11-01T17:06:22.083,993
8891,327,1,from my experience - laptop out for practical lessons - as @GypsySpellweaver says some people learn best by doing.  If students save code samples - that's the majority of their notes right there.  for theory however - pencil and paper.  It's far faster to get information down especially when it involves diagrams etc.,2017-11-01T17:14:35.937,993
8892,3889,0,Or maybe the student is not suited to the vocation and he's doing the person and society a great favor. As I see it either the student with come to realise that its good advice and adjust their major before it's too late or they will buckle down and work harder. It's quite possible that the student knows the correct answer but is afraid that they are wrong so doesn't want to say anything.,2017-11-01T17:49:11.513,3389
8893,3884,0,_@Mark Pascal was designed for the specific purpose of teaching programming concepts and good practice -- or at least good practices as they were understood at the time.  And it was great at teaching but not that great for large-scale maintenance.  Unfortunately tools designed to teach and tools designed to be used in large-scale deployment don't always mean the same tools.  And these days we demand that fresh graduates be immediately employable and productive so they're taught industry standard tools instead of useful for learning tools like Pascal.,2017-11-01T17:55:08.360,3390
8895,3886,6,I think you're being a little too naive here. If person A requires 10x as much work to get a topic X as person B in school then there's a nontrivial chance that that's going to be just as true on the job as it was during school. Meaning that hiring them for that job might be bad both for them and for the employer. You don't expect see this when they're hired because they could (and should) have already spent the 10x time necessary to become as good as everyone else who is applying. But their recognizing this can be useful knowledge for them: they can try doing something they are better at.,2017-11-01T18:13:59.043,823
8896,3886,0,So if you're going to take this practical view you should be asking yourself whether it's better to inform them of this when you think you recognize it or better not to. Of course I can think of arguments both ways and I'm not claiming that do not tell them is necessarily the worse option. But the point is it's not about whether *you* will be able to teach them that particular topic or whether *you* should just give up but about whether it'd help them in choosing the right path (future career etc.).,2017-11-01T18:16:51.033,823
8897,3881,3,Why the hell is that code so hard to understand? Here are some potential reasons: (1) int... what is int? That's not an English word. (2) answer < 1 || answer > 5 wtf are those two bars? Oh it means or? Then isn't that saying if answer is less than 1 or itself or if it's greater than 5? (3) println what the hell is printing? I don't even have a printer. Where would I be printing? And what's ln? natural log? (4) myScanner ...first my printer and now my scanner?? what even is a scanner?? I don't have a scanner! (5) if answer is -1 how can it also be nextInt?

8899,3884,0,That is only true for the first version of Pascal. It to be only usefull for teach is wrong: http://pascal-central.com/ppl/chapter4.html#Myths.

8901,3884,4,_@mamcx Yes Pascal was created as a teaching language.  So was Python.  So was Basic.  So was Logo.  AppleScript had anyone can program as a goal.  Wikipedia lists almost a hundred other languages for teaching people to program.  And yet somehow people still have difficulty.  Maybe it's not the language that's the problem?,2017-11-01T21:12:04.907,2781
8902,3884,0,_@Graham Well it might be. But there's always the chance that the person not understanding doesn't know Java but knows Python. If you only know Python there's a decent chance you have no idea what || means since Python uses the more understandable or keyword. && would make sense probably. The ln on println may have gotten confusing what the heck is a myScanner etc. With only 3-5 minutes looking at it there's also the chance that they misread >/< or something trivial like that too.,2017-11-01T21:14:58.793,3393
8903,3885,2,I read that code fragment and saw instantly that the value of (a = b) could only be false. Wrong! the author was writing in one language I was reading in another.

8904,3881,4,_@Joshua One of most important skills in CS is reading and comprehension of code (and when it comes to SE it's *the* most important skill). And this includes bad code. You can't pretend bad code doesn't exist. Plus while I agree that code could be better if you think it's bad code you clearly haven't seen really *bad* code.,2017-11-02T10:52:44.043,1093
8905,3884,1,_@Delioth By the time you get to the third set of lectures though they should understand ||.  The OP isn't really looking at println and myScanner - he says she can't even explain answer needing an initial value or what values of answer cause the loop to stop. For me this either demonstrates that she copied answers for earlier classes and never did the work or that tests for earlier classes weren't effective.  And really it shows that she generally does not understand structured logical reasoning like if you do this then that happens which is a concern for a student.,2017-11-02T10:55:01.883,1864

8909,3886,0,They might just have trouble to get the basis since they finally got their degree without doubling all their year it's seems that what you assume here is not enterely true. If we generalize (and exagerating a little) that you're basically saying that anyone that made a year of class twice (excluding personal matters and keeping only learnin problem) should just have drop school from where that year. Nova : I guess this is why it's always better to try to explain differently instead of just repeating.,2017-11-02T13:05:57.790,1375
8910,3881,6,_@Mehrdad Apparently the student has already had all of that explained to them so there's an expectation that they *shouldn't* be confused by any of those things. Maybe that expectation is wrong though. Maybe they just pretended to understand it when it was explained in the past maybe they thought they understood it - or even did understand it - at the time but have now forgotten it all. Is the failure to comprehend an inability to understand some or all of the individual parts or an inability to put them together - despite understanding them individually - to figure out the overall intent?,2017-11-02T14:28:14.417,1924
8911,3900,2,certainly most people can be taught some formal logic and ideas about algorithms. Not in my experience. It is not uncommon to see a student who has learned some of the basics of programming to nevertheless struggle mightily when they get to classes like Discrete Mathematics or Algorithms and Complexity. *Introductory* CS courses typically concentrate on programming for the same reason that introductory math classes concentrate on basic calculus. It isn't what the major is really about -- but it is an essential prerequisite.,2017-11-02T14:57:06.067,2715

It is just that we remember the ones that annoy or traumatise us. 2nd I am currently looking at ways to make programming accessible e.g. http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/,2017-11-02T16:43:46.120,204
8924,3914,0,I think actually that it is having power over people that makes for bad behavior. Witness the spate of sexual harassment cases recently coming to the fore. These are power issues not sex issues and it doesn't derive from the effort to achieve success. If some people have power they think they can misuse it without consequence or regret. Arrogance among students is a different issue though.,2017-11-02T16:50:21.547,1293
8925,3905,0,I like that. Sorry I didn't think of it myself. Maybe there should be a pedagogical pattern Honor Mistakes.,2017-11-02T17:16:43.183,1293
8927,3914,0,Another argument against the ideas in this answer is the fact that most of the bad actors are male. If it was a by product of a hard driving personality and the efforts to master programming etc wouldn't you expect to see similar behavior among girls and young women. I'm pretty sure that you won't find it there though many of the females I've encountered have as much reason to be arrogant as any male.,2017-11-02T19:05:02.540,1293
8928,3914,1,Still another reason for rejecting this idea is that it would seem to make any amelioration impossible. It is what it is. Nothing to see here. Move on. or maybe Boys will be boys. I worked long hours and had a lot of drive for my doctorate. It didn't turn me into a jerk. (Other things maybe but not that).,2017-11-02T19:10:27.187,1293

8932,3881,0,This is an anti-pattern (bad design) but should be clear to anyone reading it.  It's typical beginner code. I have known many data modelers who squeaked by their programming degree and then avoided programming because they really didn't get it. They could follow and enforce rules and recipes but could not wrap their heads around any degree of indirection.,2017-11-03T00:56:21.843,1537
8933,3881,0,This is a serious question so no flame please. Based on your empirical evidence/experience is there a gender bias for students who don't get it? If so what is that bias? How statistically strong are your numbers? ie How many students have you taught and what percentage did you find don't get it?,2017-11-03T06:12:20.857,3416
8934,3882,1,You may be onto something here. There was a girl like that in my CS classes back in the 80's. Her goal was just to get a degree so she could go into teaching. She was in CS because her dad was a prof in the Engineering department so her classes in that department were free. CS was less math than ChemE so there she was.,2017-11-03T10:17:07.333,1139
8935,3883,0,I can speak to the combination of desire to learn and inability to do so. I cannot hold a tune. In fact at most I can only tell that one note is higher or lower than another no more than that. Yet I still played Clarinet for years. My only reference for whether the note was actually in tune is if someone else told me I simply had no ability to tell myself. I tried so hard to learn but I am seemingly fundamentally incapable of hearing if a note is in or out of tune and what the note is or isn't.,2017-11-03T11:39:05.447,1919
8936,3883,3,I had all the mechanics of playing an instrument down I just had no way of knowing if what I was playing was actually in the correct pitch.

8937,3881,1,_@Bohemian I have not kept numbers that could be easily organized like that so I only have impressions. I have not noticed any gender divide (or any patterns really). I have definitely had more males with serious problems than females but I have also had many more males in my CS courses in general so it doesn't add up to any information on a gendered comprehension gap. I believe that I have taught CS to between 400 and 500 students at this point.,2017-11-03T16:06:05.743,27

8943,3881,1,On the comment about it being specifically the condition that's confusing my experience as a TA for an introductory course was that students new to programming were never taught about boolean values.  Only the magic structure of conditionals that the `<` in `if (x < 1)` is part of the `if` and only `x` and `1` could be slotted in with values/variables.  The ability to do `bool is_lower = x < 1; if (is_lower)` was mind-warping when I explained it during office hours.,2017-11-03T18:31:39.547,3262
8944,3881,3,If you ask me it's a clear sign that the student more than likely should have not passed the prior CS course(s). The student may have had someone else do their work or would always seek help as in someone explaining how the write the code while also telling them how to produce code at the same time. Therefore they would just regurgitate what was said rather than actually learning. This piece of code is by no means complex and should be able to be deciphered by someone exiting a beginner level programming course.,2017-11-03T18:42:05.897,3423
8945,3881,0,For the record I did get confused by some simple things when I learned to program. One day some topic I would find confusing would just click. I now look back and think about my blunders and wonder how on Earth I was even confused to begin with. The answer? I didn't put in enough practice lacked ambition and didn't feel confident in my skill. I was able to overcome the challenges and learned to really love programming :),2017-11-03T18:46:31.163,3423
8946,3881,2,I've found a real good analogy that I believe is amazingly accurate--think of programming as you do playing sports.  Your question can become can every child learn to play basketball--pretty much.  Can every child become a basketball pro?  Probably not.  There are various obvious physical and mental issues that clearly prevent it (Although anyone who works at it hard enough can become extremely good).  There is just as much variance in programming ability--and just as few pro-level coders.  Most of us Professionals are just playing hoops outside our garages and will never meet a pro.,2017-11-03T19:33:11.510,1399
8947,3919,0,It is only my observations my friend. I am not the only one who sees this type of behavior and the other responses support that. At first I thought it was a cultural thing but I can tell you that teaching in USA and Spain and it is very similar. I like for every student to participate in discussions and make it as fun and enjoyable as possible by making this material accessible to everybody (not just the smart tech savvy children I mentioned earlier). It is these tech savvy children that exhibit this rude behavior that I speak of,2017-11-03T20:43:39.980,3330
8948,3919,0,_@AndresAlvarez I still think you're bringing a lot of assumptions with you but let's agree to disagree. In any case my answer still offers several suggestions for creating a more inclusive environment that encourages non-traditional students to participate.,2017-11-03T20:47:59.530,2068
8949,3881,1,As someone learning programming I had a huge trouble with creating classes in Java. It wasn't until I switched languages twice until VBA functions that I truly understood what classes actually did and were used for. Even now I rarely use classes and instead find myself creating functions instead. Sometimes all it takes is a bit of time and a shift in perspective to turn a complete failure into an unqualified success.,2017-11-03T22:21:22.590,3426
8950,3920,0,Sure that's one way to think about it. Or the way I like to think about it is...,2017-11-03T23:49:15.737,2068
8951,3920,2,I don't have time for a full answer now (maybe in a day or so) but you could ask them to elaborate how their analogy is _not_ like the thing itself. Get them to explore the range. No analogy is perfect anyway and this exploration is valuable even for strong analogies.,2017-11-04T01:48:07.953,1293
8952,3886,0,_@nova I am no educator and have no knowledge of learning science; but my life experience seems to indicate that there are truly stupid people. (More generally there is a wide spectrum of intelligence but this discussion centers on the lower end.) Obviously a stimulating and supportive environment can improve intelligence even with young adults but my layman's idea of the state of research is that there is a limit to environmental influence at that point. That would indicate that yes there is an intrinsic leaning rate (ceiling). That fits with my personal experience. Do you disagree?,2017-11-04T07:04:07.577,1675
8953,3918,0,Separating the algorithm and the exact implementation is a very good idea. I think describing the desired functionality in complete sentences should give some pointers already on how to translate that to pseudocode. For each cell visible check whether it is alive or dead and output the corresponding characters.,2017-11-04T10:00:36.803,2584
8954,3892,0,I am reminded that Bertrand Russell's wife. I was curious about this anecdote which I'd never heard of before. I think it mght be Russell's grandmother not his wife. I got an hit on Russell's autobiography which says She never could understand how locks on rivers worked although I heard any number of people try to explain it to her. It's possible one of Russell's wives has a similar problem but it seems more likely you've read a scrambled version of this anecdote or remembered it incorrectly.,2017-11-04T11:11:53.207,3432

8957,3918,0,_@JarkoDubbeldam Before I was teaching I was anti-pseudo code but now I can see its value when we are learning to program. I even used it a bit as a professional programmer but with higher lever pseudo code (like a DSL (Domain specific language)).,2017-11-04T18:13:20.443,204
8959,3923,0,Pedagogically it can help to form an interest. From a CS point of view it shows emergent behaviour that is complex behaviour emerges from simple rules. You can set it up to do things that are not codded into the rules the behaviour emerges. I think that it is not 100% understood: there may be undiscovered patterns with interesting behaviour. I think it is Turing complete.,2017-11-04T18:25:12.577,204
8960,3881,1,_@Anoplexian +1 good point. It was my third language before I was able to abstract the problem from the code.,2017-11-05T01:01:14.127,1537
8961,3925,1,I absolutely applaud your desire to fill in gaps in your knowledge before it all snowballs but it's hard to even begin to give guidance without something to go on.  Could you give us a hint about a thing that you've had trouble with?,2017-11-05T04:34:03.523,27
8962,3925,0,I second Ben?€?s comment. Is there a particular language with which you have some facility? Are there things you *have* done with programming that you can build upon? More information as to what you *can* do will help us point you in the right direction.,2017-11-05T04:37:18.230,76
8963,3925,0,Thank you for wanting to help me! I have troubles converting algorithms from the textbook to source code in C++ and Java. Sometimes I struggle in implementing data structures such as queues/and stacks into C/C++ or java. I understand iterative programming and i need to improve my understanding of recursive and dynamic programming techniques.,2017-11-05T06:04:49.853,3438
8964,3881,1,There's one thing pretty much everyone seems to be missing here. The return value of `nextInt()` isn't obvious. Someone who isn't used to Java would have to check the docs to know what it returns when it can't find a number. I'm guessing from the way the code is written that it's `-1` but I can only guess that because I'm an experienced programmer I can't see a reason why a beginner would logically assume that.,2017-11-05T08:44:54.930,1538
8965,3882,0,I have to agree with this. One of the reasons I never bothered to futher my education was because I found the stuff we were doing in class to be far below what I was capable of doing at home (make a simple asteroids game vs simulate rigidbody physics make a simple 1 operation calculator vs write a recursive descent parser).,2017-11-05T08:52:38.247,1538
8966,3925,1,With regards to programming Java and especially C++ are hard languages to learn. And even harder to learn when you are learning to program. Eiffel is a good language to learn Object Orientation.We had a question on here a short time ago about first languages. Another on books to read. I will but together some ideas when I get back. Can you tell us what your background is; What you have learnt so far; What you struggle with; what you are good at; what you enjoy.,2017-11-05T09:49:32.423,204
8967,3882,2,This post seems to be 80% about bad teachers. However programming is a *constant never-ending learning process*. If you want to be successful you must be able to study and learn new things by yourself without the assistance of a teacher. Having a good one can help but a good programmer ought to have enough learning aptitude to learn to program from scratch if need be.,2017-11-05T10:19:32.917,3440

8969,3923,0,I'm not certain on what your audience would know when taking this course but my understanding of importance of GoL is in illustrating a different system of computation in asking what computation is (perhaps also showing other examples like lambda calculus or Horn clauses). I don't think GoL is a particularly good example of simulations. Also while I'm aware of mixed reception received by Wolfram's book New Kind of Science I think it would be still worthwhile to mention it when talking about GoL.,2017-11-05T15:12:36.623,1000
8970,3929,0,The lego tower is good in a couple of ways. First is the concept of the tower (list) as a whole not just its head can be easily discussed. I note that the tower is really more of a double-ended queue (dequeue) than a simple list. How do you deal with an empty tower?,2017-11-05T23:04:31.387,1293
8971,3923,0,Conway is a bit subtle to program correctly. This may be a plus. If you change the neighbor of a cell before you evaluate that cell you don't have a true representation. So you can for example talk about two generations. The first creates the second and then reference switching resets the second to the first. If you aren't careful you can get chaos that doesn't match the literature. Those two generations are like paging and off-screen bitmaps conceptually.,2017-11-05T23:10:46.847,1293

8988,3925,0,I would defiantly recommend Eiffel as a language to learn OOP. How that will work when the teachers are trying to teach another language I do not know. If using java then see this answer for how to bootstrap into OO. Java is not 100% OO. Then try to stick to OO (e.g. no static).,2017-11-06T18:00:39.213,204

8992,3881,0,Sometimes it is odd but I think programming is one of those cases where it isn't that you *can't* learn something but that it sometimes takes something else to make it click. It's been a while but there were some concepts that didn't come right away yet after taking a Digital Logic Circuits course everything started to fall into place mentally. It may be that everyone is explaining it directly as it is (programming concepts) whereas something else may illuminate it. And once the basics are grasped well it makes it easier to grok things that follow the more direct way.,2017-11-06T19:47:36.727,1477

8997,3881,0,Is there any empirical evidence that shows some people can't learn to program? Yes. I've been working in and around programming since the 1980's and I meet more and more of those people every year. They're usually working in Java or C# doing web development. Just because your student doesn't understand anything about programming doesn't mean she won't be able to find work in the IT industry as a developer.,2017-11-06T21:24:35.610,2785

8999,3882,2,Sure with tons and tons of work everyone can pass a course. *But if they need that much special attention next semester as well they haven't learned how to program*. I have a colleague who googles his problem then pastes in whatever code he finds on stack overflow randomly into his code. He kinda gets things working most of the time. This isn't someone who has learned how to program. This is someone who spent a lot of time with his teachers who helped him pass courses. Getting your code to work or passing the course through the application of sheer brute force is not learning how to program.,2017-11-07T05:36:58.150,2777

9006,3881,1,Learning is a highly emotional and relationship based process. If you were standing over this student while they were reading the code they may have been extremely nervous and they might have started off confused by why **answer** is assigned -1 instead of the simpler choice of 0. So they think they are being tricked and have been taught that it's better to say nothing than say the wrong thing. They panic and assume there is something basic they are missing and give up on trying to understand the code. It's not the student it's the *situation*.,2017-11-07T12:15:59.383,939
9007,3886,1,_@Mehrdad and Peter The key point is that prior knowledge greatly influences ability to learn. New knowledge is incorporated into existing knowledge structures which may be more or less receptive to the addition (see: constructivism). Those with well-organized prior knowledge can see patterns others can't and therefore learn better (see https://www.nap.edu/read/9853/chapter/5#32). I believe there may be differences in intrinsic learning rate but I think those are dwarfed by the effect of differences in prior knowledge.

9012,3886,0,_@nova: Apply your logic to something more tangible and you'll see it makes no sense. It's like I'm claiming that one airplane can be intrinsically more fuel-efficient than another one and you're trying to somehow counter it with *No the key point is that the number of passengers greatly influences the fuel usage and those with fewer people use less fuel. [1] [2] [3] I believe there may be differences in intrinsic fuel consumption but I think those are dwarfed by the effects of differences in passenger count.* I mean you can believe what you want but your argument doesn't support it.,2017-11-07T13:37:42.890,823

At some point I figured people really do just have different strengths. Now of course that won't convince you and you'll instead just conclude oh but you're just 1 sample (no I've seen others too) or oh you were learning it *incorrectly* (uhm yeah sure...) but I hope you realize your personal beliefs aren't any more convincing.,2017-11-07T13:52:24.093,823

9032,3951,0,An apparent difference between DFAs and NFAs is that they are functions and relations respectively. Functions are familiar to programmers because they can be programmed. (Except uncomputable functions of course.) Relations can be easily described by logical formulas but not programs.

9037,3958,0,Yes there is confusion outside of education it seems to be every where. Virtual memory is used to implement swap. Then people started to call swap virtual memory. But this answer does not answer the question. It is not about education. It does not answer my dilemma.,2017-11-14T22:09:00.540,204

9044,3948,0,I've been using regex'es since 1980 and still have problems translating requirements into them.

9045,3964,0,I understand your point and @Ben I. made the same one when I posted this question. But there's a lot more to a database than just the data (e.g. constraints on attributes primary/foreign key relationships). I am certainly fine massaging data - I am no stranger to that - but it would be nice to *also* not need to go through and add all of these different DB-specific components/guess what the designer had intended for their dataset. I want students to be able to manipulate the data and see these things in action (e.g. delete a primary key see it cascade to foreign key tuples).,2017-11-16T11:05:28.573,830

I was thinking about making two groups. The first group for Scratch the second for Godot engine or something that involves coding (with objects properties methods etc.). Do you think going directly with Godot for a boy around 14years is too much?   Those classes would span for ~8moths 1.5hours per week.,2017-11-16T15:16:51.450,3493

9050,3819,0,`the simplest first program: a DataGridView that allows full update of a table` That is in no way a simple feat especially when you're still at the stage of trying to understand what's going on. I would suggest splitting all the steps (at the very least Read Update Delete) and looking at them separately. You first learn to walk then you learn about music theory then you learn to play an instrument.

9051,3964,0,_@cryptic_star Adding those restrictions is part of the massage process I'm talking about. The chances of you finding a data set in exactly the format you want is very low. My point is that you should just put it into the format you want yourself and stop trying to find perfectly formatted data. You'll open yourself up to a lot of cool data sets if you think about it that way.,2017-11-16T16:42:28.470,2068
9052,3964,0,I understand and I might very well end up going that route in the future.

I simply find myself in an unexpected position of needing such a set of data ASAP differing from the two above.,2017-11-16T17:28:00.940,830
9054,3967,0,Good point thanks. I don't know it this will shape your answer a bit but this course is off-school. It's one of those activities parents enroll their children after school. So I guess that If they sign in they are somehow interesed.,2017-11-16T19:55:29.253,3493
9056,3961,0,I think it could be a good answer with an example. Can you add an example to the answer.,2017-11-17T13:03:52.003,204
9057,3967,1,That is extremely pessimistic and ill focused. You don't include any personal objectives for schooling only an external view. In this view people don't count only the production of various kinds of people. A better view IMO is that schooling is to actually help a person learn and grow but you ignore that. In your view there is no actual need to teach at all. Present the material is insufficient and unnecessary. The material is all online now and can be found by anyone interested. But students need to also need to know what are the likely outcomes of their choices.,2017-11-18T12:20:40.017,1293
9058,3967,1,You seem to assume that schooling is unconcerned with actually guiding or helping _people_. But even with the desire attainment is difficult. It requires long hours and dedication. That is aided by support from teachers to help them over the hard bits. You express a take it or leave it attitude that I find unacceptable. I suspect that you don't actually teach. If you do I hope you can someday somehow come to a more positive view. Your students will be better for it.,2017-11-18T12:25:03.523,1293

9069,3971,0,What does the knapsack problem have to do with undecidability? A high computational complexity is radically different from undecidability. I fear that by teaching them together you're going to confuse the students into thinking that exponential-worst-case problems are unsolvable even though they get solved daily (e.g. in compilers).,2017-11-20T00:19:10.693,124
9070,3971,0,I edited my question title. In the context of the curriculum the topics of complexity and undecidability go together standards-wise. They are sub-categories of the EU quoted above.

9099,3975,1,With Prolog you can always inspect the source code using `listings/1` or `listings/0` predicates. You can also modify them using `assert` / `retract` (more info here: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse48 ). I'm using Prolog (SWI) from Emacs but there must be other editors perhaps less scary to beginners. SWI also has `qsave_program/2` to save program image but I don't think it's ISO Prolog.

9101,3951,0,_@beroal Any language in Prolog family (Ciao Mercury beside Prolog itself) has predicates with various nondeterminism modes. So _of course_ it is possible to write programs that have relations rather than functions.

A more popular language that deals with relations is SQL.,2017-11-23T14:38:04.993,1000

9104,3951,0,_@wvxvw: This is what I am talking about. Few programmers use descendants of Prolog and SQL is specialized comparing to first-order logic so reasoning about relations should be unfamiliar to most programmers.,2017-11-23T19:05:46.997,160
9107,120,0,_@Heather I've been programming with databases for decades (since before SQL was mainstream) and I can't keep the names and definitions of normal forms straight in my head. While it's necessary to be able to choose the pattern It's not necessary to manage names and definitions. Knowledge itself has a structure and the simplest structure that captures the problem wins. Sometimes you have to adjust the structure of your database to match new knowledge.,2017-11-24T02:37:55.783,1537
9108,590,0,I am still not convinced that `git` is teachable. Yes some will get it but most will not. see https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/2897/204,2017-11-24T17:39:32.780,204
9109,3613,1,As author of question [How to make git easy to learn](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/2897/204). It was not and was a self learning question. I was asking because another teacher wanted to teach it. But I asked in the self help style because I was not ready to consider teaching it until I was first able to teach my self. I use mercurial which I found easy to learn. I still can't get my head around git's mismatch between commands and features.,2017-11-24T17:47:46.023,204

9113,3991,0,I have looked at their website and found out nothing about it. I feel like they are trying to herd me toward the pay wall. I just found a link ?€?Tell me more about Xamerin?€? it takes to to a page with little info and a big download button this button takes me to a sign up page.

9115,3991,0,I like the nice UI and the extensiblity as stated in my answer.

9123,3991,0,You can use it for more than just Xamarin as stated in the comments. It's just that the team inside Microsoft that published this tool is the team responsible for Xamarin. You can use it for plain old C# (that's how I use it).,2017-11-29T09:36:21.190,279
9130,3998,3,Welcome to the site. And nice question. The idea filled me with excitement. I would love to hear how it went after you have done it. Please at this time add an answer as a retrospective.,2017-11-29T17:16:39.787,204
9131,3998,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Thank-you for your kind words.  I'll certainly do that!,2017-11-29T17:28:50.427,1660
9132,3998,1,Actually the developer role and the product owner role should be separated. The product owner could be one or two students or yourself but not the class. I assume you are providing the backlog. I can provide some guidance but your bullet points as stated confuse me a bit. But what you want is feasible certainly.,2017-11-29T17:38:20.773,1293
9133,3998,0,_@Buffy Yes having a small group of product owners might be better than the whole class.  However having some class input is I think essential.,2017-11-29T17:53:07.400,1660
9134,3999,0,Great feedback!  Thank-you. I've worked as part of an agile team for the last ~10 years and have taught it under the SW project management label so I believe I am well-versed in its details.  I'll have to see how to keep the full scope hidden or partially revealed (tool-wise I mean).,2017-11-29T17:56:09.883,1660
9135,4000,0,Wow that's a lot to digest! Thank-you!  I will say that what I want to teach in the course will not fit into one semester so in that sense we'll have to be agile: what is taught will be determined by the product owner group.  I'll respond more as I consider your answer.,2017-11-29T19:29:49.390,1660
9136,4000,0,You don't need to give up. You can be agile in a smaller project as well as a big one. If you choose features wisely you can also have a useful part of a bigger project done in a term. An agile project is done when its PO says it is done not when the backlog is gone. Build features in order of value (which then decreases as you go). Quit when the cost of the next set of features exceeds the value. Costs rise per feature since they are integrated into an increasingly complex application.,2017-11-29T19:58:57.507,1293
9137,4001,0,A key idea here is that you can make the student's successful even if your course design fails and the project fails as well. Students can learn as much from this as from success. Good job. +1.,2017-11-30T11:34:45.260,1293
9138,4001,0,More great feedback! Thank-you!  I did think about how to distinguish the roles : especially for people new to it it could be very confusing who is doing what when and why they are doing it.  All three answers so far have giving me lots to mull over. I will try to edit my question on the weekend to update it with more details trying to address all your concerns.,2017-11-30T12:45:50.183,1660
9143,189,0,I agree I thing it can also be useful to practice other number bases. Base 3 is interesting when you have digits of `-` `0` and `+`. There are other number bases that they may already know: E.g ask when is $11 + 3 = 2$?,2017-12-02T18:06:31.680,204
9144,137,0,It was important to know in the 1980s when there were still computers for which the natural expression of the bit-ness was octal in common use. There are still Unix-isms where knowledge of octal is useful  otherwise I'd agree it's mostly a waste of time.,2017-12-03T03:48:17.230,1537
9145,3726,0,_@T.E.D. Every high-level program is compiled to machine code. The only flow control instructions in machine code are `jump` (goto) and `jump_to_subroutine` (gosub / call this one is almost structured). The point is not that it gets converted to a goto the point is that all gotos should be used to implement control structures and preferably these structures should be baked into the language and add-hock goto removed from the language. `break` in a `for` look is a control structure but break in a `case` may not be. You have to make your own structure with `case` in the `C` languages.,2017-12-03T15:21:27.697,204
9146,3699,0,I still need to be convinced of the value of teaching `goto` even to low ability kids (How low ability are they? Are they brain damaged or just farther behind than others?) I can see that `goto 1` is an easy place to start it is easier that using `for` or `while` but what next. Can you show some evidence (anecdotal is ok) of how it helped you.,2017-12-03T15:33:12.633,204
9147,3727,0,The body of my favorite language parser's main() function was while ((f=*f()) != null);  All structured no gotos but most people couldn't understand it. Gotos or switch (which is just a hidden goto) would have made it more clear to most people.,2017-12-03T19:55:05.863,1537

9152,3998,1,I just finished the Android course for my BAS in Software Development and I'd be worried about time and schedule and covering enough of the basics right at the start so that the students can actually do something (setting up Android Studio getting the emulator set up for whatever target you specetc) and then learning the app/activity lifecycle and fragment management and such.  I do like the idea of incorporating agile/scrum though - you could use it for the second half of the course for students to complete a final project.,2017-12-05T05:36:03.110,662
9153,3998,0,_@ivanivan Thanks for the feedback!

9155,4012,0,I have rubber ducks too :)  And a few of my labs are rubber-duck themed as well.  I haven't had a lot of success getting kids to actually talk to them.  They laugh about it when it is explained but don't actually talk.  Have you solved that problem?,2017-12-05T20:14:16.370,27
9156,4012,0,They laughed but once a couple of kids tried it and it worked there was buy in.,2017-12-05T20:21:59.783,30
9157,4012,0,_@BenI. Did you ever talk to the ducks yourself? =) Lead by example and all that. That said I expect that most students who don't want to talk to the duck opted to speak with their neighbor as the answer suggests.,2017-12-05T22:48:54.000,981
9158,4012,0,I don't talk to it but I do have a stuffed Angry Bird that I toss around when I'm trying to work something out. For the ducks I think it helps get across the idea that they are working through a problem and just banging away on the keyboard without thinking is almost never the best way to attack the problem.,2017-12-05T23:12:45.780,30
9159,4011,7,This might not work work with everyone and might in fact backfire.

9166,4010,11,It took me a decade to realize that my teacher who responded with pedantic questions (having me explain every little thing about my question) had the right approach. Not only does it teach you that _questioning your own assumptions_ is often the best solution but it also incentivized the students to not bother asking questions willy nilly as it would take time and effort to deal with the teacher's series of questions. If you're easily approachable students will quickly involve you in the process. If there's a cost (annoyance tax) attached they are more likely to avoid you if possible.,2017-12-06T13:33:42.687,2164

9169,4010,0,_@immibis I understand what the word oracle means. I'm asking what it means to become an oracle in this environment. Is it just answering questions in general? Is it answering questions without the students really learning anything? Is it something else?,2017-12-06T17:26:48.967,2068
9170,4010,0,_@Flater I don't think the point is to get them to avoid you. Rather it is to get them into the habit of seeking their own solutions either internally or with the available materials. You won't be there for them forever. But if you make it a bit easier for them to do that than to just consult the oracle then everyone wins.,2017-12-06T19:08:00.090,1293

9173,3727,0,_@T.E.D. I have no idea on what you disagree on. I have just re-read the answer and comments. I see nothing to disagree on. You are correct that you can not turn gotos-full code to structured-code in any reliably way. However it is better to write structured code in the first place though this could involve `goto` statements if the language does not support the control structures. Then if you know the full list of control-structures this code could be translated to have no `goto`s.,2017-12-06T19:21:44.973,204

9175,3920,0,In the concrete example given the connection seen is that *a collection of event handlers* is similar to *a collection of things*. I suspect this is where the difficulty in correcting the student arose.,2017-12-06T20:11:52.927,3697
9176,4010,0,_@Buffy: Maybe I worded it too strongly. The intention isn't so much to make them want to avoid you but rather only come to you when they have _sufficient_ reason to do so (and not e.g. ask before looking themselves),2017-12-06T20:27:42.730,2164
9177,4010,0,Point taken but it is a skill like any other that they need to learn and practice and that you can help them with. Being easily approachable is a _good_ thing. So foster that but teach them to come with a harder problem and a bit of prep.,2017-12-06T20:42:47.490,1293
9178,270,0,I feel this answer could be improved by expanding on the belongs to the type notion by making it clearer that it is **shared by all instances of the class** (where changing it affects all classes (and sub-classes)). For example if all cars make a honk noise then that could be modelled as `public static String noise = honk;` (or perhaps as a static `makeNoise()` method. If you were to be providing sound-effects over a silent movie then it would be inefficient to have a separate honker per car - instead you'd have one for all cars (i.e. make it static therefore shared by all cars),2017-12-06T21:57:11.213,3697
9179,270,0,Of course whether it is appropriate for whatever-is-being-made-static to be shared is another question is a topic of later when looking at proper design and design-patterns.,2017-12-06T22:00:04.823,3697

9184,4020,0,You are making a huge assumption that this would be used to evaluate students instead of to self-evaluate as a teacher. I would never give up on a student really for all of the reasons that you just outlined. But part of the emotional life of a teacher is that you *really want* to do a good job. It matters to you. So when I look at my own numbers I also need a way to contextualize them. Am I doing a reasonable job or do I need to go back and rebuild everything from the ground up?,2017-12-07T13:13:22.880,27

9197,4020,0,_@BenI.

9204,4027,0,Assessing programs that are non trivial can be a very subjective task. Is minimum lines to be preferred over easiest reading?

9205,4017,0,So do we need Xcode to run Swift?,2017-12-09T16:05:38.907,204
9206,4017,0,No you don't. You need Xcode to run the playgrounds or build Mac/iOS apps but Swift itself will work just fine without it--even on Linux! (You can still use a REPL or compile it into an executable.),2017-12-10T14:17:37.880,3700
9207,4017,0,Note that on Mac you're better off getting Xcode anyway as it comes with the compiler etc. (If you try to run clang/gcc without it it'll prompt you to install the Command Line Tools which contains the compiler etc. but not the Xcode GUI.),2017-12-10T14:17:54.620,3700

9209,3972,0,_Drawing a completely connected graph for example and adding vertices._ ?€???I think you need a better example. The time to add a vertex and all its incident edges to a complete graph grows **linearly** with the number of vertices not exponentially.  Drawing a complete graph takes time **quadratic** in the number of vertices assuming each edge can be drawn in constant time.  Even if the time to draw an edge scales linearly with its length and the vertices are evenly spaced on a circle whose radius is proportional to the number of vertices drawing a complete graph takes only O(n^3) time.,2017-12-10T19:32:20.873,3718

9214,3973,0,I think it is a bit marginal but other don't seem to agree so it is fine. You could explore it elsewhere as well of course and might get more/better answers. But in general just because something is _used_ in education doesn't necessarily make questions about it relevant here.,2017-12-11T15:16:23.420,1293
9215,4034,1,I'm not sure about your ladder analogy. You don't need to understand each black box layer in order to develop good code. Learning does take time and experience informs better choices but most modern programmers will never need to understand (for instance) the bitwise `xor` trick for switching case in ASCII nor the purpose of the instruction register; such low-level considerations get abstracted away by the higher-level languages.,2017-12-12T16:09:09.797,27
9216,4034,0,I've used the term scaffolding sort of like you're describing the ladder. It takes breaking up the end result into what pieces your students need to know to get there. Like Ben said and especially in an intro course skipping levels is sometime necessary to get to the end result.,2017-12-12T17:30:30.683,30
9218,4014,0,I worry that some of them at least will not use the time wisely and just wait for you. My _strong_ opinion is that you need to be more responsive. You won't be building better habits if they just fidget spin for five minutes.,2017-12-13T02:26:11.827,1293
9220,4037,0,I intend to continue to think about this and may update it.,2017-12-13T12:37:14.330,1293
9221,4037,0,What is *IFTTT*?,2017-12-13T13:04:50.483,27
9222,4037,0,IF This Then That: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTTT,2017-12-13T13:15:46.073,1293
9223,211,0,I know a handful of seasoned C programmers who seeing `*(pointer + integer) = z` would instantly charge at you with any sharp and heavy object they can find. It is widely believed that doing arithmetic on pointers and integers is one of the worst intentional features of C. This was a motivation for creation of a lot of other languages who'd proudly declare that unlike in C this kind of pointer arithmetic is prohibited.,2017-12-14T13:04:56.860,1000
9224,4009,0,Does this help: RosettaCode Y-Combinator [Scheme](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Y_combinator#Scheme) ? If so I can make it an answer.,2017-12-14T20:48:19.977,2516
9225,4043,0,Human Resource Machine is a genuinely amazing game so much so that we purchased a site license and added it directly into our curriculum (and it gets quite challenging).  TIS-100 was a lot to start and I never got over the initial hump.  This is an amazing collection of resources.  Wow!,2017-12-14T23:04:48.933,27
9226,134,0,I've edited and re-opened the question.  A. Biswas if I've modified your intention feel free to roll back the edit.  (I tried to stick with what I believed you were asking),2017-12-14T23:45:06.527,27
9227,4044,0,There is a meta conversation that refers to this question [here](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/340/the-list-nature-of-lesson-ideas?noredirect=1#comment643_340).,2017-12-15T00:12:20.883,27
9228,4046,0,Actually approximating any infinite series could be adapted to this idea. Euler is interesting however in that both the sum and the factorial need to be captured in the same loop.,2017-12-15T00:39:36.220,1293
9229,4044,0,I'll note that many problems that can be one with a simple (non-nested) loop can also be done recursively.,2017-12-15T01:01:08.813,1293
9230,4047,0,There is an opportunity here for connecting the problem to History. In HS students may simultaneously be studying the history of the period in which the Enigma machine was a critical issue.,2017-12-15T01:06:33.950,1293
9234,4046,0,Possibly related: http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/ellipsis,2017-12-15T10:44:56.173,1293
9240,4009,0,_@GuyCoder It certainly helps.,2017-12-16T21:06:33.523,27
9241,4009,0,_@Buffy The memoization example there is amazing. I'm still trying to make sense of it.,2017-12-16T21:11:52.487,27
9243,3886,0,_@Mehrdad Your analogy makes no sense. Intrinsic fuel consumption happens to dwarf passenger count in airplanes but that isn't because of the fundamental logic of the situation but because of the laws of physics. I think a better analogy would be to stocks: With companies founded at different times there is massive variance in profit growth in an absolute  sense even if profit growth as a percentage of the previous years profit is the same across all companies.,2017-12-17T03:32:29.613,3586
9244,3886,0,_@Mehrdad To take the analogy to students there could be an intrinsic learning rate as a percentage of prior knowledge but given varying backgrounds of students this would be only extremely loosely correlated to absolute growth in knowledge over a given term.,2017-12-17T03:32:47.757,3586
9245,4051,0,Now that I've seen your writeup are you saying that the lab activity is itself to create `fib` and `fac`?,2017-12-17T17:49:31.070,27
9246,4051,0,Yes. The activity would be first to create the Y combinator then to verify that it works one could write `fib` and/or `fac`. I also find that reading the book noted is a gentler way to learning what is going on and why. While I don't know your end goal with Lambda Calculus. If I were teaching a class on it I would keep one of the goals being to understand [System F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F) which is the basis for a lot of functional languages and language research.,2017-12-17T17:57:00.877,2516
9249,4,1,Have you considered making them use an OO- API before writing their own classes?,2017-12-17T18:58:49.030,2103
9250,4,0,_@MichelBillaud That's a good point.  And there are many resources out there to help with that.  I've never been inclined in that direction but perhaps you are right that that is the best path forward.,2017-12-17T19:13:37.903,27
9251,3907,0,Does [SHENZHEN I/O](http://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/) meet your requirements?,2017-12-17T21:19:45.677,2516
9252,4053,0,a card -> deck of cards (array of cards) -> blackjack shoe with 6 decks in it -> game and -> player's hand.  Then have them implement a blackjack game and add in things like the current card count % chance of going bust if another card is drawn etc.,2017-12-18T00:32:21.647,662
9253,4053,0,The Deck class can lead to inheritance (ex. A Pile class a Deck a Hand) But I think it leads to simple discussions like  who's job is it to turn a card face up?,2017-12-18T01:17:52.697,695
9255,4053,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]!  I hope we hear more from you in the future.,2017-12-18T02:33:49.807,27
9256,4,0,_@BenI. The interest of encapsulation polymorphism inheritance etc. is difficult to demonstrate on small size self-contained examples. Silly examples like animals and vehicles don't help.,2017-12-18T10:41:49.650,2103
9257,134,0,The example given seems to me to correspond to a different question (how to explain to people the importance of using library functions rather than writing everything from scratch?),2017-12-18T11:02:31.700,1219
9258,4054,0,This answer is very short. It is of little use as it tells me nothing about the ..... (word left blank because I know so little that I can not fill it in).  There is also no link for the first so I can not even look it up.,2017-12-18T17:22:25.810,204
9259,4054,0,I'm so used to the fact that repl.it is the name of the product and the url that I forget to link when discussing. Since the topic is interactive programming environment I misjudged that the products listed would be interpreted as such. I will agree that it should be further edited to indicate that these products do address the features and usability requested in the original post.,2017-12-18T19:55:34.317,695
9274,4057,1,A very easy CTF question might be a lot of fun though 6 is still a bit young.  Human Resource Machine is a great game and the first few levels are accessible to any age.  A few questions: will you have internet there? Is there some sort of budget for devices (like Arduinos)?  Is there some particular direction you're considering heading off in?,2017-12-19T14:01:31.447,27
9275,4057,2,This question is likely to generate a big list. Perhaps you should provide some criteria by which the suggestions can be assessed and judged.,2017-12-19T14:05:54.383,150
9276,4057,0,Edited question :),2017-12-19T14:14:01.803,3761
9277,4057,0,_@BenI. No particular direction... we can do simple coding robotics circuits etc... anything that would get a kid hooked :),2017-12-19T14:19:05.243,3761
9278,4058,0,the best advice you can get is: read the manual for `cmake`  then use google to search for examples etc.,2017-12-19T15:57:09.937,3762
9280,4057,0,You may also be gain some inspiration from this question: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/2540/what-would-be-reasonable-to-include-in-an-introduction-to-ai-class-for-a-7th-8th,2017-12-19T19:30:01.440,27
9281,4058,3,What does ?€?organize header files?€? mean?,2017-12-19T21:19:56.610,124
9282,4060,1,To generate a pattern like that would take a nested loop though.,2017-12-20T01:27:20.477,27
9283,4060,0,_@BenI. I suppose that depends on the language. I could do this with a single loop in Processing.,2017-12-20T01:44:20.917,2068
9284,4037,1,Theperfect student may actually benefit from the frustration of pair programming although he or she will not appreciate it at the time,2017-12-20T03:44:09.483,1537
9285,4062,1,Perhaps you could share your code for these. Or at least a minimal framework.,2017-12-20T14:21:45.107,1293
9286,4062,1,I agree with @Buffy that a link would be helpful.  But the ideas here are a nice contributions.  Welcome to [cseducators.se] and I hope we hear more from you!,2017-12-20T15:01:48.657,27
9287,4065,0,Welcome to CSEducators. We hope to see more of you.,2017-12-21T13:33:16.230,1293
9288,4066,0,We thought about using the final assignment from a previous year (around 800 LoC). Do you think that is big enough or should we use a bigger project? If so do you have one in mind? Since most open source projects that i have had a look on the code have terrible code documentation.,2017-12-21T14:05:09.847,1868
9289,4066,0,If that is the scale of the assignment to come then it is probably a good choice. Others may need something bigger in a similar context. It is probably a mistake to overwhelm students unnecessarily. And you may need to doctor whatever code you find before use. You could also use the sessions to improve the code of course. That might be especially valuable in this context. You don't mention whether the students start the project with a given codebase or start from scratch. That can affect how you proceed but the toolset would likely be the same.,2017-12-21T14:10:03.440,1293
9295,4067,2,C was created at Bell Labs. If you worked there it was a firing offense if you didn't brace all. I.E. Brackets are NOT an option. Make your fingers do it so you don't need to even think about it. If you have a good IDE the close bracket will be correctly placed if you open a brace and hit return.,2017-12-21T17:27:28.843,1293
9296,4069,0,Welcome to CSEducators. You should really expand a bit on your answer explaining a bit about why you believe each is important. Longer and more complete answers are valued over short ones.,2017-12-21T17:40:17.570,1293
9297,4069,0,While I agree that a bigger program might be desirable in general in the writer's context the short one if it better matches the local need is probably better. Especially if old questions to be addressed have approximately that length.,2017-12-21T17:42:25.583,1293
9298,4069,0,Interesting profile you have also.,2017-12-21T17:43:49.740,1293
9299,4069,0,_@Buffy thank you.  I'll add a bit I really just wanted to comment but I don't have permissions on this site,2017-12-21T17:49:03.423,3775
9300,4069,0,If you give a better answer you'll probably earn rep here and the comment ability will flow forth.,2017-12-21T17:53:28.353,1293
9301,4069,0,not worried about it thanks for your input :),2017-12-21T17:57:49.587,3775
9302,4065,14,As a working software engineer I implore you: teach ideas rather than tools. E.g. how/why to use version control rather than focusing on git.,2017-12-21T18:38:12.730,3777
9303,4065,6,If this is a first semester C course your curriculum shouldn't contain  *any* of the tools your propose.  They need to know how to link compile and debug.,2017-12-21T19:16:27.410,882
9304,4070,1,Welcome to CSEducators. I agree that understanding assertions is an important idea.,2017-12-21T19:16:41.317,1293
9305,4067,0,CQRS is probably out of scope for an introductory course anyway.,2017-12-21T19:18:00.713,882
9306,4065,2,`<shamelessPlug>`Dear HNQ visitors [this question](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/4058/enjoyable-and-or-fun-way-to-explain-cmake) was asked yesterday and is related enough to this one that it might also benefit from your expertise. `</shamelessPlug>`,2017-12-21T19:23:36.563,27
9307,4071,0,I was literally typing in almost exactly this question when your question popped up on the feed. Crazy! My question also referenced virtual environments (such as you have when developing an iPhone app) and the console because these environmental factors are very hard to explain to a kid who has only ever used applications.,2017-12-21T19:39:15.927,27
9308,4071,1,Well that makes more sense.  I just realized that I saw your question yesterday on SO. It must have infiltrated my brain to the point where I thought it was my own question.  :P  In any case welcome to [cseducators.se]!!,2017-12-21T19:41:10.597,27
9309,4067,0,I just looked-up CQRS. It does not seem to be the same thing as command query separation (CQS).,2017-12-21T21:18:46.350,204
9311,4071,0,A development environment is an environment that you develop [code] in. An integrated development environment (ide) is a development environment where the tools have been integrated to produce a seem-less environment. You no longer have to save compile run. You can just press run. The can also incorporate linting unit-test revision-control etc all from the editor.,2017-12-21T21:23:33.883,204
9312,4074,0,Online tutorials. If an IDE does not have decent online tutorials I tend to drop it like a ton of lead.,2017-12-21T21:31:53.423,2516
9313,4075,0,Actually setting up a class forum in which you _don't_ wipe it between years can be even more valuable as the common questions will already be there for the current class to peruse.,2017-12-21T21:50:23.043,1293
9314,4075,0,_@Buffy Certainly plausible (that is afterall how SO works). I just know that online colleges give classes blank forums to start with.,2017-12-21T21:51:52.337,1244
9315,4075,1,I usually had a class wiki for each course. It lived from year to year. It was also helpful in letting me plan the next iteration as I could find typical problems the students were having. I could edit out things I didn't want to give a hint about prior to the start of the term.,2017-12-21T21:54:27.097,1293
9316,4075,0,_@Buffy Neat! I'm not an educator myself I just pop in here from time to time because I see a question that I can have some input on--usually things that I've either learned on my own *or* have struggled with in the past (e.g. something that was poorly taught to me). e.g. [this answer](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/970/1244) from earlier this year.,2017-12-21T21:57:12.917,1244
9318,4076,0,Nice observations about pointers.,2017-12-21T22:33:55.220,882
9319,4076,1,_@RobertHarvey I almost left it out of the answer since it's not really a best practice but I've *never* seen students move from complete confusion to complete understanding as quickly as I have after giving that explanation so I decided it was worth mentioning anyway.,2017-12-21T22:41:10.020,827
9320,4063,2,I've done the same thing but then I caution students to read all the questions before they start writing.,2017-12-22T00:33:52.617,3524
9321,4067,3,I would also add a note about Global Variables and Code Reusability to your list.,2017-12-22T00:40:44.203,3780
9322,4077,0,Although very usefull  the lecturer actually substracts points for each use of of the goto statement. but thank you for a clean example how to actually use it.,2017-12-22T09:33:37.487,1868
9323,4069,0,Using an ide or a specific operating system is well out of scope. Also cmake  and jenkins are  as such very specifc and beyond the need of a short booster course that only intends to give our colleagues  an edge for a specific lecture. I agree with the excurse to maths and electrical engineering but as already stated this is just a booster course by students for students. =),2017-12-22T09:38:29.523,1868
9324,4066,0,They start without any codebase just the standard libraries.,2017-12-22T09:39:22.700,1868
9325,4067,0,_@jjk_charles Global variables are forbidden in the lecture and are an instant fail. Code Reusability is actually a good idea to have that explicit and not just implicit!,2017-12-22T09:41:17.870,1868
9326,4065,0,_@Jake the reason for git is that many students send their code via email and facebook. Wich is quite contraproductive if they do the merge all by hand every few days.,2017-12-22T09:43:23.307,1868
9327,4065,0,_@RobertHarvey how would you propose for them to  share the code in the groupproject? Make makes submission compiling and debugging way easier in the way that they dont need to enter every flag and also every groupmember uses the same setup for debugging execution and compiling.,2017-12-22T09:45:49.910,1868
9328,4065,0,_@drewbenn Im a student as are the other parties involved planning this 3 session course. Also shell commands are not in the scope of this.,2017-12-22T09:49:02.103,1868
9329,4067,2,My $0.03: probably `i` is well-known enought not to adding much information over index. Similarly no points for guessing what `v` and `a` are in physics simulator. `pos[i] += v[i] * dt; v[i] += a[i] * dt;` is probably clearer than `positionOfObjectsArray[index] += velocityOfObjectArray[index] * timeDifference; velocityOfObjectArray[index] += accelerationOfObjectArray[index] * timeDifference;`.,2017-12-22T09:51:57.590,673
9330,4065,0,For C - checking the return values instead of assuming it will succeed. Even if this is `if (someCall() == false) { fprintf(stderr error <some description>\n); abort(); }`.,2017-12-22T09:55:53.600,673
9331,4065,0,_@drewbenn The following points knock them out: they dont know how to test they dont know how to check for memory leaks they have no concept of capsulating for example memory allocation(single function for memory allocation and initialisation) program flow -> clean exit if error is encountered etc,2017-12-22T10:28:57.763,1868
9332,4081,0,Welcome to CSEducators. A somewhat different perspective but a dose of reality. Thanks.,2017-12-22T12:28:47.103,1293
9333,4081,0,Sadly enrollments are so high at this moment (late 2017) that many departments are indeed trying to winnow the students. I don't know if that is the situation here but it has been discussed elsewhere. This happens every few years actually and is often followed by a drought. The fact that many of the topics discussed in this thread were omitted from the course in question may be an indicator that this is the case actually.,2017-12-22T12:31:47.370,1293
9334,4081,2,Thank you for making clear what i did know deep down but didnt really consciously knew. If nothing better pops up in the next few days youll get the accepted answer.,2017-12-22T13:32:37.630,1868
9335,4065,1,_@gismo: Would the source control be maintained for them?  Source control is not a mountain of detail I would want in my first-semester C class.  Is this a two-semester class?  See also Jake's comment above.,2017-12-22T15:35:12.587,882
9336,4065,0,_@RobertHarvey If you mean by maintained hosted the university provides a git server with unlimited repos. Its a single semester.  Why is everybody focusing on the class? We would just do about 3 sessions of about 3 hours. The focus on git is because the uni provides one. Additionally to why we would just introduce a basic workflow with maybe the cherrypick functionality (binary search for the last working revision),2017-12-22T15:57:41.537,1868
9339,4079,0,Though it is still missing some sourcing I'm tempted to accept this answer.  I've observed that you write consistently helpful content.,2017-12-22T18:15:04.363,27
9340,305,0,Uh how can we know what the distance is between the two variables at all? Couldn't they be anywhere in the address space in any order?,2017-12-22T18:39:09.973,3700
9341,4076,1,Regarding *explained that a pointer is just an integer that is used to index memory* this can be a double-edged sword. It can lead new C programmers to think they're in on the secret about how things *really* work which is actually oversimplified and wrong and thereby insist on being allowed to do very wrong/against-best-practices things. Even `ptr+n` becomes confusing for new C programmers when they think that `ptr` *is* an integer rather than *has a representation as an integer*.,2017-12-22T19:02:07.243,1327
9342,4067,6,A couple major points of disagreement. First comments **both are bad**. Commenting `i++` to explain what the statement does is not useful it's clutter and trains new programmers not to actually be intentional about good comments. A good comment might be something like `/* Skip an additional element because the code below assumes... */` or similar. Comments are to explain purpose not to translate C to English.,2017-12-22T19:05:37.453,1327
9343,4067,0,Second while being inflexible about braces or variable naming may be good for the purpose of a course you need to prepare students to be flexible about coding style and policies because they **will differ** in real-world work. Being led to believe they've been taught the one true way about anything that's a matter of style or tradeoffs sets them up to doubt the competence of programmers/teams that do things differently for well-justified reasons or just because it's not a big deal.,2017-12-22T19:10:05.147,1327
9344,4076,1,_@R.. Whenever I need to simplify things I let them know that I'm doing so.  That's the best middle ground I've found between letting them believe that an approximate explanation is precise and trying (and failing) to explain everything at once.  That said `ptr` *is* an integer.  It's just not an `int`.  But even `int` is a closer approximation of its type than `&**magic[42]->&a` which is frequently how they seem to view it without this explanation so I'd be fine with them thinking of it along those lines *at first* as long as they understand it's an approximation of how things really are.,2017-12-22T19:14:27.003,827
9345,4065,0,Is there any possibility that a different language could be used? C is not the easiest to learn especially if you want to teach safe effective C.,2017-12-22T19:24:02.243,3783

9347,4076,2,_@Ray: The only sense in which it is an integer is that the bits of its representation can be interpreted as an integer which is also true for floating point types and I wouldn't say that they are integers. For C implementations common in the past 2-3 decades with flat linear address spaces *as an implementation detail* there's also a partial algebraic correspondence between pointers and integers. I say partial because many operations that are defined on the int side are not defined on the pointer side. But other implementations are certainly still possible...,2017-12-22T19:31:23.423,1327
9348,4076,1,...and may gain traction again with interest in memory-safety or with embedding C in nontraditional environments (like in a JS-based web ecosystem via web assembly or similar).,2017-12-22T19:32:12.590,1327
9349,4076,1,_@R.. True enough. I taught this at an introductory level so that level of detail *remained* covered by the There are a few details I'm glossing over disclaimer whereas the `ptr+n` actually adds `n * sizeof(*ptr)` bytes issue might have actually been discussed eventually. I *could* have explained that a pointer is defined in terms of the behavior of certain operators when applied to it on the abstract machine and that the implementation is permitted to use any representation that yields the correct behavior per the as-if rule but that would just confuse them worse.,2017-12-22T19:47:05.797,827

In your first example I could assume that v stood for vector and a for acid or something. I cannot make that mistake in your second example. There is a lot of value in being 100% sure you eliminated a mistake over being 99% sure. Especially when it doesn't cost you anything to add the 1%.,2017-12-22T20:34:21.897,1028

9357,4074,0,Yes certainly. There is very little difference between a compiler and an interpreter actually. Everything but the back end is the same. The compiler outputs a file and the interpreter executes some intermediate code.,2017-12-22T21:53:17.487,1293

9360,4067,0,_@EvSunWoodard No I'm claim they are _more_ readable as they are a) domain specific word no different than lingo of any other buissness client and b) if you have sufficiently long equations you may need to spill over to next lines making it less readable by sheer verbosity. Those are toy examples but consider `(legendre(x k).plus(legendre(x k - 1).times(Float64.valueOf(eta_k)).plus(legendre(x k + 1)).times(Float64.valueOf(1 + eta_k)))).times(Float64.valueOf(0.5))`. If you know domain it's more or less clear - setting aside problem of lack of operator overloading in Java (...),2017-12-22T22:43:54.977,673
9361,4067,0,(cont.) `(legendre(x k) + legendre(x k - 1) * eta_k + legendre(x k + 1) * (1 + eta_k)) * 0.5;` would be clearer. However changing `legendre` to `solutionToLegndreEquation` or `k` to `numberOfCalculationPoits` etc. would not help without looking at the original paper... which used the same notation so changing notation would make things even more confusing. In similar way changing `for (size_t i = 0; i < FOO_SIZE: i++) foo[i] = i;` to `for (size_t indexInFoo = 0; indexInFoo < FOO_SIZE; indexInFoo++) foo[indexInFoo] = indexInFoo;` doesn't help much as virtually everyone uses `i` for index.,2017-12-22T22:50:53.223,673
9362,4076,0,Pointers may work like mailbox numbers in the language invented by Dennis Ritchie's but students need tor realize that the langauge favored by modern compilers is far less logical and pointers will only behave like sensibly if certain ill-defined rules are followed.  Note that the rules used by compilers are similar to the ones in the Standard but compilers sometimes disregard the Standard in cases where following it would disallow optimizations they want to perform and think the Standard should allow.,2017-12-22T23:18:13.363,2073
9363,4076,0,_@R..: Ritchie's Language does offer secret insights into how real computers actually work.  It's important that students are aware however that some implementation lets people write code for actual machines while others are limited to programming abstract machines that impose rules more restrictive than those of actual machines and which will misbehave in weird and arbitrary fashion if code deviates from those rules (even in cases where the actual machine would have behaved predictably).,2017-12-22T23:31:16.200,2073
9364,4065,0,* the reason for git is [...]* That is the reason for *source control*. @Jake was asking you to distinguish between the category of tool and the particular implementation you're going to cover (chosen in this case because the school hosts a `git` repository). So `gcc` is just one compiler; `gdb` is just one debugger; `valgrind` is just a particular profiler/leak-detector. If your students stay in this business they will replace tools  but they will keep using the same classes of services.,2017-12-23T00:03:18.420,2735

9366,4076,1,_@supercat is demonstrating my point very well. :-),2017-12-23T00:56:31.860,1327
9367,4079,0,Common sense would seem to indicate the same thing. More common sense would indicate having the order of questions track the order of material as presented in the course since students are likely to orient their thoughts that way. But the easy -> hard rule is important so that students don't spend their time on hard problems at the start missing easy points if they run out of time. Another independent idea is to suggest (strongly) that students read the entire exam before attempting any answers. There are multiple reasons for this including letting the brain work in the background.,2017-12-23T01:15:17.937,1293
9368,4077,3,_@Buffy Because they're local variables and it writing separate structs and functions to deal with resource management for every combination of such variables does not scale well.,2017-12-23T01:24:58.703,2828
9369,4077,0,Nor does repeating code every time a given combination recurs. Especially if things change and you have to revisit every instance. Abstraction is your friend.,2017-12-23T01:38:59.830,1293
9370,4077,0,_@Buffy If you find yourself using the same combination of resource allocations frequently yes clearly you should abstract some of that away.  That won't be true all the time.,2017-12-23T04:03:42.600,2828
9371,4077,1,_@Buffy Additionally even if the resources could be freed by a single function I would still advocate using `goto`.  It's still easier to maintain; if you need to change the signature or semantics of you resource deallocation function you'd won't need to revisit every exit point.  Also doing `goto exit;` at each exit point is simpler than `FreeMyResources(...); return NULL;` if you need to return something.,2017-12-23T07:28:32.353,2828
9373,4065,0,I'm very happy to see you encouraging the use of `make`. I use it extensively now and believe that it is a staple of programming that everyone should know. I would also recommend demonstrating how to use `#include` and the breaking up of a project into multiple files; include guards etc.,2017-12-23T09:38:57.780,3791
9374,4077,0,That's one of the two acceptable uses of `goto` (the other being breaking from two loops at once or jumping out of a loop when you found what you're looking for). I'm still not sure if I would bring that up in an introductory programming course before they've learned the more important control structures (just imagine the result when a student forgot about `while` but remembered `goto`.),2017-12-23T09:58:27.117,3793
9375,4077,0,In any case you could make more than one distinct `exit` label there so that each one just does the necessary cleanup implicitly falling to the next one in order e.g. `exit3: fclose(); exit2: free(); exit1: return`.,2017-12-23T10:00:14.947,3793

9379,4083,2,I would not expect a student to be able to implement an interface before they have done classes and inheritance. But they should be able to inherit an interface that you have made and implement it. It would also be better to have a full interface (that is one with contracts).

9386,4092,0,Actually it seems to have understanding programs (first & second rows) prior to creation of programs (third row). I don't think it implies that there are no variables in the programs to be understood. Especially if variables at that level are just presented as references to values. A complete understanding of variables (as things that can be changed) is necessary for the goals of the first two rows. You are probably reading too much into it.,2017-12-24T14:25:56.930,1293

9442,4100,0,The program you give is impossible to understand with out a global understanding and that is missing. This is primarily because of a poor choice of names (yours or the frameworks). E.g. `size` is a noun so we would expect it to return a value but it does not. I guess it sets the size (`setSize`). `second` is a noun so should return a second object (what ever that is) but seems to return a number so maybe it is the second number but of what. I see no list.

9444,4100,0,I think you are being overly critical here of someone trying to help. The example seems fairly reasonable if you just assume there is a preexisting framework in which the students program. You are being a bit nit-picky on names and while I agree with the noun-verb concept not everyone adheres to it so it is unreasonable to expect perfection here.,2017-12-29T12:10:57.993,1293

Are you talking about citation of the processing documentation? It explains that parentheses contain a list of parameters as in `size(600400)` or `background(255) ` or `second()`.

9454,4114,0,I feel like I learned a tremendous amount from this answer.  I would have mentioned garbage collection and pointer referencing/referencing but my knowledge of C++ is also fairly shallow.  This is a much deeper answer.,2017-12-31T05:19:00.323,27
9455,4113,2,Even if the differences were trivial - and they aren't - you still have a different tool set tool chain debugging methods. And the library ecosystem is different as well.

9457,4114,0,Thanks for the informative answer. I understand that C++ features guns knives and clubs that make it much more difficult to master. To teach this I need projects that actually require the use of such features... while there are endless ideas for software projects  many of them can be built using only the standard c++ libraries that handle all memory issues for you.

9463,4113,0,`C++` has multiple inheritance. Few modern languages have this even fewer do it properly (Eiffel being an exception). Take some inheritance structure that can also be comparable. Implement it so that you implement each of `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `=` `!=`. You can implement them all in terms or `<` in the base class then the inherited class only has to implement `<`. No `compare(a:T b:T): int{-101}`. Note multiple inheritance is safe but repeated inheritance is not and must be handled correctly.,2018-01-01T16:18:33.103,204

9469,4126,0,You can show them the more advanced examples without expecting them to reproduce them on a test. That way you open the door for interested students but don't overwhelm everybody else.,2018-01-04T21:09:19.947,2068
9471,4126,0,_@KevinWorkman That's a good solution but I still don't know where to draw the line. Also I'm not sure if I'm missing other (more important) examples.,2018-01-04T21:28:17.053,27
9472,4124,2,One thing to consider is that many (not all) patterns are established workarounds for weaknesses in the platform of choice. As such they may be language or environment specific.,2018-01-05T05:24:26.187,1537
9474,4124,1,It's a bit more subtle than that. The _solution_ in a pattern is driven by its _context_ and the prevailing _forces_. It is generally a mistake to try to apply a solution blindly. That is why patterns are written like they are. Most of the classic patterns arose in a C++ or Java sort of world. As such they may not be meaningful if you use Scheme where different patterns would apply. Pattern writers spend a lot of time expounding on the forces in particular and those explain why the solution is correct _in the given context_. A pattern is much more than a problem-solution pair.,2018-01-05T11:15:30.183,1293

9481,4122,0,Are you trying to teach all of those patterns in one 10-20 minute lesson?,2018-01-05T20:33:02.393,177
9482,890,0,My tests are lab practicals.  These involve problems of escalating complexity that demonstrate various levels of proficiency from basic to advanced.   I do not expect students to get 90% of this; I am looking for their level of proficiency demonstrated by what they can create.,2018-01-06T01:14:06.280,21
9483,4122,0,Though the gang of four book was the book that introduced patterns to programmers it has little else going for it. It was inspired by Christopher Alexander book of about 250 patterns. Alexander said that this was just a few of the many patterns G.O.F. said that their ???20 was all that there is (even though they described MVC but did not identify it as a pattern. Since this time many other patterns have been described in other books plop is one source of patterns.,2018-01-06T11:04:31.317,204
9484,4124,0,Yes GOF focused on the solutions but the solutions are not the patterns. ?€?You want the computer to do something many times but if you tell the computer many times then it takes a long time to type and is difficult to change (as you have to make the change in many places). Therefore tell the computer once and tell it how many times to do it. ?€? use for-loop or repeat-x-times?€? That is a pattern.,2018-01-06T11:10:20.687,204

We value longer answers more than such short ones so that visitors can learn more before navigating away. Short answers are more likely to be ignored but thanks for contributing.,2018-01-08T00:57:48.430,1293
9503,4139,0,Hello! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Thank you for sharing your thoughts here. To me this doesn't really answer the question which asks for problems and exercises. Can you please edit to try to better address the question?,2018-01-08T17:24:58.260,58
9504,4139,0,I'm also not sure how this answers the question.  Can you edit the answer to clarify this a little?  The downvotes will be removed if the link is clear.,2018-01-08T17:56:55.773,27
9505,4139,3,This view of programming seems too narrow. It is relevant at most to programming in languages close to machine code. It would be harmful to those learning Scheme or Haskell for example. Students can learn to think from the start at a higher level than boxes with numbers.,2018-01-08T18:11:08.710,1293

9510,4148,4,This is a nice clear example of recursion but is it a good *motivating* example for the entire process?  The iterative version (such as the simple `for` loop) is both more efficient and simpler to write.,2018-01-10T03:32:18.357,27
9511,4147,1,I don't have problems thinking of recursive methods but I do struggle to see how this will help. From a code POV it will look something like: `for (s in sheets) { switch (s.region) { a: region[a].append(s) ...} }; parallel for (r in region) { for (s in r) { switch (s.name[0]) {...} } }` and the students will still see it as imperative though it can be written in a recursive form more easily.,2018-01-10T05:37:23.150,3472
9512,4145,0,Bonus points if you use card instructions to implement the passing out of cards.  ;)  Actually that would probably get a LOT more interest than just passing out the cards in the usual manner and then beginning the exercise.,2018-01-10T05:37:41.947,1103
9513,4146,0,That doesn't seem to directly answer the question as you *don't* solve such things with recursion.,2018-01-10T05:39:27.087,1103
9514,4147,4,Hmmm I'm not entirely certain that students would grasp that sorting on more than one key by sorting first on one key and then on another key actually IS an example of recursion.  That sounds a little funny even to me.,2018-01-10T05:41:01.127,1103
9515,4144,1,I think you've got it.  Actually that's the *only* example on this page (so far) that can't be answered with just Okay so what?  That's just as easy or easier without any recursion.,2018-01-10T05:44:36.963,1103
9516,4146,3,I prefer Quicksort for demonstrating recursion. I learned merge sort back in the days when it would be done non-recursively using sequential I/O streams and O(1) RAM and I've in fact found it useful in an embedded system for storing records stored on a flash chip (the flash chip had more than enough space to hold two copies of all 5000 records but the system had less than 3840 bytes of RAM).,2018-01-10T07:28:31.940,2073

9520,4149,2,Welcome to CSEducators. We hope to see you again. Note that we value longer posts over such short ones especially posts that are just links that require navigating away from the site for explanation. It would be good if you could give a longer explanation of the curve its algorithm or why you think it is important pedagogically.,2018-01-10T11:33:59.300,1293
9521,4150,1,Welcome to CSEducators. We hope you come back often. Could you expand your first paragraph a bit to give at least a hint about _which_ recursive techniques.,2018-01-10T11:37:51.110,1293
9522,4151,26,I think this is the best approach. Show recursive functions by processing recursive data structures (here: the folder structure)! Other classical examples (like Fibonacci or Factorial) often trigger a reaction like Nice but why do I need that? by the students. But every computer user has seen recursive data strucures at least once in their life (e.g. folders). Showing them that such structures can be processed elegantly by recursive functions gives often the desired woweffect.,2018-01-10T11:43:34.630,2158
9524,4151,15,+1. Depth-first tree traversal is the simplest example I can think of where the recursive approach is truly easier to understand than the iterative approach. And even students who are not familiar with trees will probably be familiar with folders in a filesystem.,2018-01-10T12:40:46.237,3873
9527,4145,1,When you noted `base case` I was expecting to see a follow-up with induction which didn't occur. So now I have to ask when you say base case are alluding to induction or it is just a coincidence of words?,2018-01-10T13:40:49.397,2516
9528,4145,2,Recursion and induction are related of course. So the use of `base case` seems pretty natural to me. You need a base case to avoid infinite recursion just as you need a base case to avoid infinitely recursive definitions when using induction.,2018-01-10T13:52:01.060,1293
9530,4151,4,There's a good chance an iterative programmer will already know how to do this without recursion by use of a stack,2018-01-10T14:09:36.573,3693

9534,4151,2,Another classical example for a recursive function: Raytracing with reflection. Requires some (very) basic knowledge of geometry and linear algebra.

9546,4146,0,_@Wildcard Yeah my point is that things like heuristics and alpha-beta pruning are more advanced topics that the basic recursive algorithm leads to.

9553,4151,1,_@phflack My experience is that students that do not yet understand recursion are also bad at appropriate use of data structures. YMMV.,2018-01-10T23:26:01.613,990
9554,4156,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. This is a breathtaking answer.  There is much to think about in here!,2018-01-10T23:29:57.453,27
9555,4145,1,I don't agree that studying the base case winding phase and unwinding phase is motivating at all! It feels like overly-abstract gibberish. The point is not to study how recursion works abstractly the point is to demonstrate how it's useful. Passing cards around also feels too artificial to be a meaningful demonstration.,2018-01-10T23:57:04.907,1275
9556,4149,1,The Sierpinski Triangle may also be a good one. To draw the triangle draw 3 triangles (in the right places).,2018-01-10T23:58:19.247,1275
9557,4147,1,You just proposed an iterative approach.,2018-01-11T00:08:33.820,1275
9558,4145,1,I think you missed the point. The phases and the base case are essential to know and understand. You need a set of tailored exercises that solidify the knowledge of all those parts to be sure the student gets it. The instructor also needs to be explicit about how each exercise uses the parts. With an incomplete understanding it is harder to be an effective program designer. This is especially true in languages that do effective tail recursion elimination.,2018-01-11T00:10:42.700,1293

9560,4147,0,_@immibis How so? I'm not seeing how breaking a big problem repeatedly into smaller subsections fully solving the small problems and recombining at the end is iterative. It's basically a mergesort.,2018-01-11T01:13:22.750,27
9561,4147,1,_@BenI. Putting the forms into 4 piles is an iterative loop. Putting the forms from those 4 piles into 26*4 piles is just two nested loops. It's not recursive because you are just saving up all the work from one step until you're done with that step. See muru's comment.,2018-01-11T01:53:27.987,1275

9569,4147,0,_@immibis Do you see any way to fix my description?  Apparently I'm being unclear to many folks but I'm unsure about how.,2018-01-11T04:23:46.950,27
9570,4147,0,Perhaps it's because the intuitive way to do this is non-recursive (it's essentially a breadth-first search made with two nested loops).,2018-01-11T04:36:24.580,1275
9571,4159,0,A bit of both but mostly how to explain the new features to students with no programming experience at all. (In this particular class most students do have some Python 2 experience but I'm thinking about the future.) And it was the main instructor's decision.,2018-01-11T05:02:04.697,3897
9572,4155,0,Now all we need is a motivating example for using a tree structure.,2018-01-11T08:35:44.867,1055
9573,4126,0,_@BenI. the course I studied had number theory in parallel with an introduction to Java and although I can't remember the exact lecture-by-lecture sequencing it's possible that modular arithmetic had been introduced in the number theory course before numeric operators in the Java course.,2018-01-11T08:51:51.217,1219
9574,4162,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a very interesting answer.,2018-01-11T11:15:26.070,150
9576,4160,0,Quite similar but I tend to use little endian = little end first big endian = big end first. Seems to stick with the people I have explained it to.,2018-01-11T12:47:26.483,3907
9577,4158,0,You can do the naive way easily with recursion as well though :D,2018-01-11T12:48:22.253,3907
9578,4147,1,_@BenI. I think the major problem of the algorithm is the fixed recursion depth of only two levels. If you had done something like *split by 4 regions. Every pile higher than 10 sheets split by first letter of name. Every pile higher than 10 sheets split by second letter of name. Every pile still higher than 10 sheets?€?* the recursive approach (with *small enough pile* as base case) would have been clearer. Using different things (4 regions and 26 letters) in the two first steps didn't exactly help either.,2018-01-11T13:14:12.030,660
9579,4147,0,_@Bergi Thank you!!!  I re-wrote it significantly to try to make it more obvious.  Is it better now?,2018-01-11T15:05:46.867,27
9580,4166,0,This is not only a gorgeous problem but would also work very well in an Objects-first curriculum.,2018-01-11T15:24:03.390,27
9581,4166,0,Oh and welcome to [cseducators.se].  I hope you'll join us in our mission here!,2018-01-11T15:26:09.377,27
9582,4151,1,This was literally how I discovered recursion many years ago!,2018-01-11T15:34:47.183,3911
9584,4147,0,Thanks much better. However the core part of the recursion (*Repeat the procedure as many times as*) still doesn't stand out over the clever sorting algorithm so I'm not sure the students will grasp the difference between recursion and divide-and-conquer.,2018-01-11T16:24:15.710,660
9585,4151,2,As a (very) amateur programmer that just writes scripts for a data analysis recursion has always baffled me and I've never had to implement it thus far. But I instantly understood it with this example. So here's at least one piece of anecdotal evidence that it works for a beginner.,2018-01-11T16:45:27.097,3914
9588,4146,1,_@Wildcard: I had a Tic-Tac-Toe assignment I still remember in a first-year CS course.  The week after the assignment our instructor asked who had used recursion to solve it.  IIRC I was the only person to put up their hand.  If there was a move that forced a win my program made it.  Otherwise it would play the first (or one of I forget) the moves that would lead to a draw against best play.  I remember adding a random-first-move option so it wouldn't spend a couple seconds fully solving the game before making a move on an empty board :P,2018-01-11T18:15:40.867,1654
9589,4155,0,Anything where you need a stack data structure to implement iteratively is a potential candidate including the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function (which has the advantage of not needing a data structure as input.),2018-01-11T18:17:09.443,1654
9592,4167,0,This some interesting hand-waving and analogy but does nothing to change the fact that `prod *= i;` in a loop is just as easy to write and runs faster (unless the compiler optimizes your recursion back into a loop).  The problem has no stack-like state that needs to be preserved for back-tracking so recursion isn't helpful or necessary for factorial.  I know you didn't mention Fibonacci but recursive Fib is even more dumb because it takes O(Fib(n)) time instead of O(n) time for a `a+=b; b+=a;` loop. Recursive Factorial doesn't make the complexity class worse so it's not as bad an example.,2018-01-11T18:39:25.140,1654
9593,4155,0,_@StigHemmer Lookup over ordered sets (e.g. std::map) or sets with string keys (usually in the form of a trie) abstract syntax trees network flow (minimum spanning trees) pathfinding (really almost anything involving graphs will have a tree somewhere) hierarchical clustering minimax suffix trees...  It's like asking when you'd use an array or a variable; I'm almost not sure where to start.  Of course some of these also have non-tree-based ways to do them and the exact functions will differ from the binary search tree example but they'll all use recursion somewhere.,2018-01-11T18:40:06.773,827
9594,4158,0,_@Koekje Well you wouldn't want to spend too much time on an algorithm that would never work in reality.  With the recursive approach you've only wasted about 10 minutes of your life writing the naive version. :-),2018-01-11T18:56:06.887,827
9595,4158,0,_@Koekje anything done with recursion could be done iteratively (through a stack data type stored in heap) and anything done iteratively can be done with recursion (as is typically done in languages without mutable variables). The real point is where is recursion more _elegant_ (especially for beginners especially if you're teaching them a language which supports mutable variables - which 99% popular languages do - R and MATLAB (I may be wrong as I don't know them at all) seem to be the only exception in [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)'s index).,2018-01-11T19:06:28.080,3896
9596,4168,0,They definitely don't know `xrange` or anything about functional programming. Depending on the class they either have never programmed before at all or have a rudimentary background.,2018-01-11T19:37:30.583,3897
9597,4158,0,_@cse Yes I know. Generally with method calls behind the scenes a stack is operating anyway so the recursion will indirectly be translated to an iterative approach. The point I was trying to make but failed to do is that for me it seems like you could interpret the answer as recursion being a whole different beast automagically opening up a vastly improved way to  solve the Sudoku. I do not however see how recursion is more elegant with languages containing mutable variables. Isn't it the other way around? Why are most functional languages built on using recursion?,2018-01-11T19:42:08.177,3907
9598,4169,1,Welcome to CSEducators. I like this answer. If you want to improve it you could add a link or two especially to a writeup of Ackerman's function. Better yet explain a bit about why it is important.,2018-01-11T20:21:54.717,1293
9600,4165,0,First if you only work on one computer architecture then endianness is automatic and of little consequence I have to disagree with that. When I write disassemblers on Intel which use little endianness and the code coming out is little endian and [Intel Architecture Software Developer Manuals](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf)  make references in big endian then not knowing this will ruin your day. Continued,2018-01-11T22:45:06.550,2516
9601,4165,0,I can't remember how much of a problem it was because after I figured it out I was able to abstract it away in a function but for disassemblers of little endian processors I would not say of little consequence :),2018-01-11T22:45:47.127,2516
9603,4158,0,_@Koekje Sorry the opposite. In languages with only non-mutable variables you _must_ use recursion for everything even a simple `for` loop. The question is where could recursion be useful in a regular imperative or OOP language.,2018-01-12T00:11:44.700,3896
9604,4159,1,I had this problem the other day. I told a pupil type `range(10)` into the interactive shell (to see what it is) but it now replies `range(010)`. When in the past it showed a list `[0123456789]`. This made it possible to see that it could be replaced by a list.,2018-01-12T06:47:59.123,204
9605,4157,0,Endian is named after the end of an egg that the lillyputians eat their eggs from precisely because it does not matter. If code is written well it does not matter. All you need is an awareness of the problem and how not to depend on it.,2018-01-12T06:51:17.527,204
9607,4170,0,Now that is a cool story. Welcome to CSEducators. There is a lot here that might interest you.,2018-01-12T13:16:05.557,1293
9608,4170,1,You didn't quite state this but your answer brings up the possibility of seeding the field by simply utilizing recursion in front of the class at some prior time. The way I envision it I would point it out but leave it largely unexplained until we got to the proper unit.  This would serve to let them know that the possibility existed and feed their curiosity naturally so that when we later get to the unit they would be interested in exploring that oddity.  (If you like that feel free to integrate it; it would also give a classroom tie-in which you are currently missing.),2018-01-12T13:18:44.920,27

9610,4154,0,I agree with Buffy. This does not appear to actually answer the question. If you want to discuss the question's premise feel free to do so in the chat room I mentioned in my comment on the question.,2018-01-12T18:25:50.033,58
9611,4169,0,This list of possible algorithms doesn't really add anything to the already existing answers. Can you add some depth so that your answer *adds* to the other answers rather than simply restating them?,2018-01-12T18:28:04.303,58
9613,4159,1,A range is exactly that - a definition of a beginning and an end point. The 2.7 default behavior made it look as if it were a list and confused the issue.  To new programmers there is no change it is simply how things are.  Only those with prior expectations will be confused.,2018-01-12T21:42:06.497,1537
9614,4172,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! How will the example of water illustrate to students why they need to *learn* recursion?,2018-01-12T23:18:31.310,27
9615,3933,0,_@pluke Have you uncovered anything additional in the intervening time?  If so I would encourage you to also create an answer here if only to help others in the future.,2018-01-12T23:41:49.197,27
9616,4159,1,_@pojo-guy Good point. The only problem is that explaining it that way makes it look like there are two fundamentally different ways to do for loops. And you can't directly examine what the range function does. But maybe you should make your comment an answer.,2018-01-12T23:46:59.367,3897
9618,4172,1,To add to what Ben said this same task could be accomplished with a `while` loop. Why would this example help students see the necessity of recusion?,2018-01-13T01:12:34.100,58
9619,655,0,_@BennettBrown I think it's a good analogy and can be accompanied by a statement that this isn't a *real* definition of Judaism just a useful analogy for demonstrating recursion.,2018-01-13T07:15:54.467,1103
9620,1240,0,Good but that's not really an *analogy.*,2018-01-13T07:17:27.673,1103
9621,1306,0,Good one!  And if you get a stack overflow it's time to get a simpler dictionary and start over!,2018-01-13T07:18:38.930,1103
9622,4152,0,Interesting starting point for discussion.  It bears mentioning that a much more effective way to *actually* understand an article is to clear up every *word* you encounter that you don't understand *when* you encounter it and not go on past a misunderstood word *at all.*  But that's not an example of recursion (just the most important rule of study).,2018-01-13T07:22:36.500,1103
9623,4143,0,Mergesort is one algorithm that's very easy to understand recursively but a bit harder to get if you do it iteratively.,2018-01-13T10:58:48.267,3745
9626,4159,1,Yes with the old behaviour it was obvious that a list could stand in place of a range. Is there a way to make this connection with python 3 (to make it easier to **learn**)?,2018-01-13T11:31:03.587,204
9628,4174,0,Thanks a lot for sharing! I am sure it will help me a lot next time I teach this course.,2018-01-13T16:50:26.137,1873
9629,4177,1,Are **you** familiar with `C++`? In case your're not the better question would be: *what other programming Language should we learn beside Java?* Eg: the automobile industry is using *plain `C`* because `C++` didn't hold its promises regarding speed (either developing nor execution time)  and safety.,2018-01-13T17:07:30.930,1256
9630,4177,0,After some thinking I believe you cannot get a good answer from here because  we all live in our *filter bubble*. I personally know nobody doing `C++` for a living. Some other might know only people coding it and nothing else. So what you're asking for is a *research* about the current importance of `C++` in the current industry which most likely non of us has done (yet)...,2018-01-13T17:45:51.220,1256
9631,4177,0,I disagree. The question seems to be about why to teach C++. That is certainly relevant here. I've authored C++ books by the way and many members though not particularly active are experts in C++ and its instruction.,2018-01-13T19:17:03.183,1293
9632,4145,0,Excercise 3 looks like it would have one mark too few?,2018-01-13T23:04:42.680,653
9633,4158,0,Isn't the naive approach 9^81 instead of 10^81?,2018-01-13T23:09:26.463,653
9634,4145,0,That depends on whether you want to count the base case or not. If you do the base case should also mark the card.,2018-01-13T23:21:00.190,1293
9635,4143,2,_@Pureferret I was expecting that to link to StackOverflow... you trolled me!,2018-01-14T01:25:13.213,719
9636,17,0,There are lot's of good suggestions below. I would suggest using an example that does not admit an easy iterative solution. Bonus points if it does not use tail-recursion.,2018-01-14T04:56:52.130,3948
9637,4143,1,How to motivate them?  If you don't study recursion you're going to fail the test on recursion and also do bad on the parts of the semester exam that are on recursion.,2018-01-14T07:29:16.637,3132
9638,4179,1,*C++ gives students an opportunity to learn about pointers pointer arithmetic and memory management. You could also get into casting and bit-operations which forces the students to learn about data representation. * These are concepts of *plain `C`*. You don't need `C++` to demonstrate them. But Yes it's hard to get a pure `C` compiler (for free) these days...,2018-01-14T12:11:16.267,1256
9640,4179,0,_@TimothyTruckle Fair enough :)  I mentioned I was not a C++ programmer.  Most of what I teach is in Java so those concepts were guesses on my part.  Buffy's answer is undoubtedly far better in terms of what concepts should probably be focused on.  My point to OP was more about how to justify (and set up) a class for students.,2018-01-14T14:49:50.197,27
9641,4177,3,It is not that C++ is fast (to make if fast all sorts of manual optimisations need to be done) but that Java is slow. Java is slow because of virtual machine and because of memory layout. e.g. for a linked list it is impossible in java to ensure that the payload is proximate to the linked list therefore a java implementation will suffer many more cache misses. Another thing that java does not have is proper tail call optimisation. However while it is easy to list short comings in Java I would find it impossible to recommend C++. The only time to use C++ is to make a contract last forever,2018-01-14T15:28:00.720,204
9644,4154,0,I think the brief answer gave the structure of why recursion is useful based on what computers do well. This goes to the fundamental reason to teach it rather than more and more examples of it.,2018-01-14T19:07:37.423,3958
9645,4178,0,Overall very good  I'd add that c++ implementations of low level code like the guts of xalan/xerces xml libraries tend to be twice as fast as their java counterparts. On the other hand there are certainly places where java is comparable in throughput to c++. You might point out that the jvm is written in c/c++,2018-01-14T19:32:43.367,1537
9646,4179,0,In my experience  people start to really understand programming after they learn their third language. C++ is sufficiently similar to java that there is carryover  but different enough to increase the breadth and depth of their skills.,2018-01-14T19:36:36.320,1537
9647,1363,0,I learned BASIC first (the one directly descended from FORTRAN not later flavors like GWBASIC or VB). Later I learned Pascal and I had to relearn memory but my model was still wrong. Later I learned C on a VAX 11/780 for which C is structured assembly language and developed yet another model that was closer to correct but still wrong. Finally I leaned assembly on 6502 x80 x86 and 68xxx processors built some computer s by hand soldering the parts together and then I understood memory.,2018-01-14T23:08:07.873,1537
9652,4177,0,Memory allocation?  That's just scratching the surface.  The C++ language is _enormously_ more complicated than the Java language.  Just for example take a look at the documentation for [std::enable_if](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/enable_if) and see if you can design a non-trivial exercise for your students that requires them to use it.  Or just try (I dare you!) to learn anything about the [Boost libraries](http://www.boost.org/) by reading their `.h` files.,2018-01-15T02:29:38.047,1269
9653,4179,0,_@TimothyTruckle GCC with the right command-line options can be made to obey and enforce any of several different versions of the C standard. (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Standards.html#Standards.),2018-01-15T02:40:11.943,1269
9654,4177,0,One thing you can do with typical tool-chains for C for C++ for Rust and for many other programming languages but _not_ with typical Java tool-chains:  You can write projects that create _native executable code_. That covers a lot of territory including; code that links with code written in other languages code that directly calls the operating system loadable modules and device drivers that run _in_ the operating system.  You can write your own operating system.  Or you can write embedded bare metal code that runs with no operating system at all.,2018-01-15T02:54:21.260,1269

9660,4151,1,_@PeterCooperJr. I think you're being silly; phones haven't *replaced* other computers for *any* generation and any high-school-age kid these days is going to at least have experience with using Microsoft Office which implies experience with saving files on a traditional file system. Pretty much the only people who are *only* familiar with phone and tablet OSes are a handful of tech-illiterate old folks whose families bought them a tablet because they thought it'd be easier to get the hang of (there's such a person in my family).,2018-01-15T09:23:24.253,3960
9661,4169,0,Well better show recursion on example where the recursive approach is the _obviously_ simplest solution to a problem. Not everybody comes quickly to a solution to the Hanoi problem if ever. Same for sorting.,2018-01-15T09:59:07.387,2103

9665,4143,5,_@RonJohn Yes fear motivates some but this kind of motivation will never make them like or enjoy the subject. Good programmers are creative and think for themselves ?€? obeying your rules will never teach them the skill of problem-solving which is crucial. Furthemore the point of teaching is preparing students for real-life problems. By not showing scenarios where recursion is beneficial you would teach them nothing as they wouldn't recognise recursion as a good tool.,2018-01-15T14:15:22.953,602
9667,4143,0,_@m93a the question was about *motivation*.  A teacher can say here are important real world examples until he's blue in the face but **that's not motivation**.  Recursion was interesting *to me* as a student because some algorithms were cleaner to implement that way.  Of course I also thought this is all academic since it'll just blow the stack when the problem gets realistically big.  So... wanting to keep my grades up is why I **really** learned recursion and have *rarely* used it since.,2018-01-15T14:30:54.397,3132

Yet when presented well it can show the power of recursion and motivate students to explore the technique and develop the mental muscles to use recursion when appropriate.,2018-01-15T17:22:24.217,104
9676,4164,0,Which is exactly what the question is about! =) And I said your answer is great not just the Tower of Hanoi.,2018-01-15T18:32:07.283,3971
9677,4111,1,Similar situation.  Was taking a hardware interfacing course. The ??C we were using (68HC12) had to be programmed in assembly.  68HC12 assembly is similar to 6502 assembly; learned 6502 assembly over a decade prior.  My lab partner was a EE major; he knocked out the hardware parts and I knocked out the software parts (faster than other teams; excellent grades). If you looked only at software you'd think he was a freeloader. Knowing we would be working separate on the final exam we knocked out each assignment then switched roles and did it again to ensure each of us could do each role.,2018-01-15T19:24:35.710,948

9680,4179,0,_@TimothyTruckle Well by that logic GCC is a Fortran compiler not C or C++. GCC is both the GNU Compiler Collection *and* the GNU C Compiler included in that collection.,2018-01-15T22:22:14.607,1275

9682,4158,0,That's not how you solve sudoku. It's not recursive. It's iterative and even that's not true. There are algorithms which are neither iterative nor recursive.,2018-01-16T06:29:50.697,150
9683,4182,0,Maybe it would be better to spend the time on teaching them better design concepts and such.,2018-01-17T10:48:52.287,1293
9684,4182,0,_@Buffy there isn't nearly enough time for that.,2018-01-17T11:52:59.213,150
9685,4183,2,Welcome to [cseducators.se]!  You've come to the right place :) Can you give a few more details?  How often will the course meet?  Are there any additional goals beyond introductory programming?,2018-01-17T12:57:08.510,27
9686,4183,0,Thanks Ben :) I updated the post with more information,2018-01-17T13:58:58.630,3982
9687,4184,0,I am familiar with both languages. However giving the kids a choice might not be the best idea because I don't think they have a good tech background besides the smartphone-using experience. I updated the question with more details about that.,2018-01-17T14:03:59.013,3982
9688,4184,3,Actually their choice needn't be strictly rational. If you were to see brighter faces for one and scornful looks for the other it might sway your choice. You want them excited not just accepting.,2018-01-17T14:06:27.070,1293
9689,4184,0,Actually even for Python I would base my course on this Coursera course from Rice University: https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1 They make a simple game in every lesson. So I'm not completely dismissing the idea.,2018-01-17T14:22:56.297,3982
9690,4183,0,For refrence we've [already discussed the issue of how some kids will see block-based programming as not real programming](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/860/58),2018-01-17T14:55:10.503,58
9691,4185,0,Welcome to CSEducators. I hope you get good answers to your question and come back for more in the future.,2018-01-17T17:50:54.020,1293
9692,4182,0,Do you mean revision control (most people seem to get this terminology wrong there are several different but related things: revision control configuration control source control and version control. They are all different). I think it is a good idea they can keep all of there files in it; not just source code. I have been using active-code from rune-stone it have a simple revision control tool. Strictly inlier commit on run. The pupils like it. It allows then to undo mistakes.,2018-01-17T19:19:32.163,204
9693,4185,1,Can you translate  ?€?upperclassmen?€? for the international audience. I am from England and have no idea what it means. (may be a foot note with age etc.),2018-01-17T19:24:49.167,204
9695,4185,1,You may also be interested in [this question](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/494/deep-learning-teaching-resources).,2018-01-17T22:13:47.413,27
9696,4185,0,The definition is loose but upperclassmen are generally 11th and 12th graders (16 - 18 years old) but sometimes include 10th graders.,2018-01-17T23:58:25.167,3990
9697,4182,0,IMHO version control is best when it's invisible. GIT'S learning curve makes it less than favored  but it is widely used and many useful tools are only available via pull from github. My preferred version control is subversion. To a user it looks like a directory structure with betraying.,2018-01-18T02:34:20.677,1537
9698,4187,0,The course will be taught in high school. May I ask what math prerequisites would be needed for those topics you listed in your answer?,2018-01-18T09:54:25.313,3952
9699,4187,0,_@scaaahu: It's mainly linear algebra that comes up in machine learning. A familiarity with vectors and working with them (such as the dot product gradient of a vector) and some calculus (differentiation and partial derivatives) would be helpful. If you didn't want to get bogged down with the details you could probably explain what you needed as you taught it but certainly the vectors pop up *everywhere* so an awareness would be helpful.,2018-01-18T15:10:08.163,2
9704,4188,0,Would you mind providing links to the relevant Kahn Academy lessons? Screenshots would also be useful because of the visual nature of the question.,2018-01-18T19:15:07.700,58
9707,4190,0,Very interesting point about adversarial examples; students might also find examples like [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864.pdf) interesting in which deep neural nets were fooled by one pixel changes. It really does make it clear how neural nets don't really see things the way we do (and perhaps makes driverless cars and such sound far more dangerous if such small changes can fool them!),2018-01-19T14:02:38.580,2
9708,4143,0,Love is a better motivator than fear.,2018-01-19T15:59:36.507,1074
9709,4190,1,_@Aurora0001 Thanks for the reference about the single pixel difference. I know about it but could not find it.,2018-01-19T17:07:47.617,2516
9710,4192,0,Welcome to CSEducators. We are always glad to see a new contributor.,2018-01-19T17:37:30.543,1293
9711,4158,0,_@Pa??loEbermann True. You're going from 111... to 9999... not 000... to 999...,2018-01-19T18:42:34.810,3896
9712,4192,2,I can't emphasize enough the part about lost work.  Virtually every week someone's laptop breaks and all of their work gets lost.,2018-01-19T20:08:37.703,27
9713,4193,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se].  You've found the right community :) Do these kids have any programming background?  Or is this just a general population?,2018-01-19T20:10:13.623,27
9714,4193,0,_@BenI. general population high school math can be assumed.,2018-01-19T22:11:51.957,4002
9716,4069,0,_@gismo Linux is appropriate for C. The Universal Operating System is fine. Debian can be considered the rock upon which Ubuntu is built. If you want to pay for UNIX that's fine too and will prepare them for employment. Also I don't know how the students could complete a 800 line assignment without a specific operating system.,2018-01-20T00:35:16.740,3775
9717,2897,0,The many links to tutorials have confirmed my belief that `git` is the assembler-language of revision control: A thin layer over the machine-code that is explained in the tutorials. One day a spiritual descendent of Grace Hopper (and also has some time) will come along and write a decent interface for it. In the meantime there is mercurial (`hg`).,2018-01-20T10:40:15.827,204
9718,4189,0,This is very interesting. Indeed I can focus my course on real-time applications and libraries that should link with other languages.,2018-01-20T17:25:04.257,1873
9719,4158,0,_@ItamarG3 [This](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=84f488360abe78ff6a74e9301727081d&version=undefined) is my implementation of my algorithm. How is it not recursive?,2018-01-21T05:00:49.307,3896
9721,4193,0,Have you looked at Khan Academy's offering?,2018-01-21T21:56:18.713,21
9722,4199,6,I would not introduce the concept of sameness (object identity) of persons at the same time. Every variable has its own value and can change on its own it is not necessarily an object reference. Also I think we can (and should) introduce variables without the concept of scopes (the same name used to label different variables in different contexts).,2018-01-21T22:47:10.887,660
9723,4197,21,What does not feel correct about the box metapher? It's the closest to variable = memory cell we got. What other concepts (besides names) do Scratch variables use?,2018-01-21T22:50:34.630,660
9725,4199,6,With my wife I have been using the names of *animals*. Obviously my wife is not a child but a quite intelligent woman but her background in mathematics and statistics makes some aspects of variables in programming counter-intuitive for her and this analogy has helped. I emphasize the name being of an animal (specifically a turtle since we?€?re practicing with a Logo-style turtle module) because *animals for the most part don?€?t know anything about the names we assign to them.* This helps emphasize that an object exists independently of names and can have multiple names refer to it.,2018-01-22T02:25:20.593,1246
9726,4199,5,It helps her remember that the turtle we called `louis` and then passed into a function is the same turtle that function just calls `turtle` and that the turtle itself doesn?€?t really care what you call it.,2018-01-22T02:28:09.293,1246
9731,1309,0,That is why BASIC used the LET operator and PASCAL used := (read becomes equal) for assignment.  In some ways it's too bad that brevity has won out over clarity in modern languages.,2018-01-22T06:03:25.410,1537
9733,4211,1,[This discussion](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/27/should-assembly-language-be-taught-in-an-introductory-course-or-soon-after?rq=1) could be useful.,2018-01-22T06:57:39.873,182
9735,4196,0,+1 for the last para.  Especially if OP's course teaches don't just copy/paste answers from code sites (like SO) when doing homework.,2018-01-22T07:43:30.760,4039
9737,4198,1,A good variation of this is that its a box with a number or sentence in it and each box has a label saying whats in it. Then you can use the metaphor to ask further questions. The Box X has some oranges in it and 2 oranges in your hand. If you know there are 10 oranges all together how many oranges in box X ? (  X + 2 = 10 ),2018-01-22T08:11:17.973,4043
9739,4206,0,When I learn programming as a kid on the C64 the book I used  used the 'a variable is a box with a name like X or $Y that you put things in to remember'. I understood it instantly. Its a good metaphor,2018-01-22T08:14:12.603,4043
9740,4212,2,No kids are fin at abstract reasoning and theres evidence in the literature that confirms that (Think about it: Kids learn to speak ex-nihilo other than some rudimentary wetware to jumpstart grammar learning). The trick is to just not use jargon to explain jargon. A box to put a number or sentence in works fine.,2018-01-22T08:16:53.690,4043
9744,4206,0,+1 I also like the use of a box as a variable stand-in. It lends it's self to further analogy.  All variables (boxes) have a type (maybe colour code them).  They need to be declared (added to the program) and then they can hold anything that fits that type of box. So you can put characters words and sentences in a red 'String' box. You can put numbers in your blue 'Integer' box and you can put either in your purple 'Variant' box. You can explain arrays with a box of boxes collections and lists with boxes that are just grouped together and constants with locked boxes and so on and so on.,2018-01-22T10:08:23.887,4049
9745,4214,4,Also some practice of assembly makes the notion of pointer (location containing an adress) really obvious.,2018-01-22T10:20:45.750,2103
9750,4199,2,Not that I agree with this necessarily but I would point out another point of view. When training as a teacher we were told that it was not necessarily best to advance a child's education like this. For your daughter she will probably be able to understand this but in future years she will have to relearn this at school and may become disinterested or disenfranchised entirely. I respect your drive to teach your daughter and I'm sure she is enjoying it but I would bare in mind that in a few years this may not have been what was best for her.,2018-01-22T11:09:34.343,4054
9752,4201,0,Thanks for sharing your experience. Would you mind sharing as well how old you were when you started learning programming and if it was completely self-taught?,2018-01-22T12:53:24.780,3982
9753,4210,3,Can you elaborate on *how* you'd explain it? I'm not sure what you mean by as something that keeps changing,2018-01-22T12:57:26.103,58
9754,4197,2,As the placeholder text says Use comments to ask for more information or suggest improvements. **Avoid answering questions in comments** (emphasis mine). I've moved the comments [to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/72042/discussion-on-question-by-golo-roden-how-to-explain-the-concept-of-a-variable-to) because they have value but further answers in the comment section will be removed and will not be moved to chat.,2018-01-22T13:01:03.537,58
9757,4212,1,There is plenty of evidence to suggest that kids are not good at abstract reasoning. Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget argued that children develop abstract reasoning skills as part of their last stage of development known as the formal operational stage. This seems related https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929314000516 and excerpt taken from https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/abstract-thinking,2018-01-22T13:21:09.870,4060
9760,4223,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! It would be preferable to include some of the examples from the resources you refer to in your answer.,2018-01-22T15:55:18.067,150
9761,4225,2,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Your answer seems to be tying together many concepts which are just slightly related to variables. It wouldn't make it simpler for a 9 year old.,2018-01-22T16:10:39.760,150
9763,4219,7,IMHO this is the best answer since it explicitly addresses a way of thinking that is suited for a 9 year old child. Hence accepted :-),2018-01-22T17:21:16.650,4017
9767,4211,0,We teach little man computer to help teach how computers work. Don't teach x86 it is too complex. LMC is a good first assembler (not a real CPU but a simulation for learning). A good real CPU for those that want one is ARM but better to use high level unless creating a compiler / dispatcher / memory manager.,2018-01-22T18:32:07.740,204
9768,4216,0,Actually you get in trouble with the Python and Ruby people saying a variable (name) has a type. It isn't that the type is dynamic it is that only the value to which it then refers has a type. Any name can refer to any value but a value has an unchangeable type.,2018-01-22T18:43:52.043,1293
9769,4224,0,The box analogy has serious problems. Suppose I have 20000 boxes? How do I find the one I want? The answer leads you deeper and deeper into harder to understand issues. Can I put the same shape into two different boxes? Is it really the same shape (value) then?,2018-01-22T19:20:30.560,1293
9770,4200,0,A variable in algebra is quite unlike a variable in computing. In your fill in the blanks only one value will be correct. It can't vary. This will become extremely confusing later and is often a stumbling block for new programmers who know algebra already.,2018-01-22T19:22:07.540,1293
9772,4219,4,Most of the other answers are technically correct but focus too much on details that are not relevant to a 9-year-old beginner programming level. The names analogy is great for when you start talking about references though. But I think that variables are conceptually different from references so the box analogy is far less confusing.,2018-01-22T19:41:54.497,4079
9773,4200,1,_@Buffy it never was for me.  ??\\_(???)_/??  It was long enough ago that I don't recall if I was aware of graphing functions where variables did vary within a single expression saw a programming variable changing as equivalent to `x` having different values in each problem in a set of questions or something else.,2018-01-22T19:55:10.057,1411
9774,4224,0,There may be a better way to explain this but I think this will cover all the bases at her level and have her still understand it.,2018-01-22T19:59:43.580,4068
9775,4199,5,_@stuartstevenson While I note that you said you don't necessarily agree with that philosophy the idea of delaying the introduction of a concept usually taught at a later age *horrifies* me. The answer is *never* to restrict an interested student but to get them different / better instruction if they've moved beyond the herd. Example: I moved from a city to a rural town in 6th grade and hardly learned anything for 4 years because there was no option but here's what everyone else is doing this term. Yes I was often bored but few would argue that my previous teachers did me a disservice.,2018-01-22T20:49:17.807,794
9776,4224,0,I worry about explanations that don't smoothly extend to deeper explanations and that need to be undone before a student can move forward. I don't think the early explanation needs to be deep or complete but it needs at least to be extensible. That is why I raise the issue of lots of boxes and several variables referring to the same value. If you explanation fails there it just fails. Even a kid can raise those same questions and eventually a bright (or even random) one will. Never set up a situation in which you need to unteach anything to move forward.,2018-01-22T20:50:17.703,1293
9777,4219,0,Role is fairly abstract ...I think it's the White House (or rather the Oval Office but that's perhaps not known to a 9 year old) which contains the current president: [And finally be sure to include the full address of the White House to make sure your message gets to us as quickly and directly as possible:  The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington DC 20500](https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/write-or-call/),2018-01-22T21:05:47.030,1675
9778,4204,1,Not many explanations are magic for any student of any age. An explanation should be more of a conversation than an answer so that the learner can reveal what they still don't get and the teacher can refine the explanation filling in the needed bits until the A-Ha experience. This is why The Perfect Lecture is an oxymoron.,2018-01-22T21:42:15.350,1293
9779,4219,14,This got protected so I can't create an answer. I think `my_age` a the perfect variable that any 9 year old can immediately grasp.  It's also a good lead in to classes later `me.age` `you.age` `class person {int age}`,2018-01-22T22:02:45.623,4088
9780,4214,3,I remember having a big gray area between hardware and software before learning assembly. I think being able to trace your code all the way to the physical objects it controls is important.,2018-01-22T22:15:05.183,4088
9781,4230,2,And then you can show them all the footguns giving them an appreciation for memory-safe languages!!,2018-01-22T22:34:49.093,3896
9782,4230,0,But don't you agree that C usually requires higher overhead from the programmer to produce something interesting compared the Python? I think teens like to see the fruit of the efforts quickly. Even as an adult who used C for years I wouldn't consider solving a problem in C over python unless the performance was an issue.,2018-01-22T23:19:59.983,3982
9783,733,0,This Coursera course from Rice University uses building games to teach programming in Python: https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1. The course covers some fundamentals of game programming along the way.,2018-01-22T23:33:02.257,3982
9785,4230,1,_@diaa Of course C usually requires higher overhead to produce something interesting but this is a beginners programming course for teens. The concept of arrays and pointers are complicated for teens. C is a great teaching tool for learning programming. It's the same as when teaching basic math the concept of showing your work rather than jumping straight to an answer. C is showing your work Python is jumping to the answer.,2018-01-23T02:26:33.033,4082
9787,4183,0,Python is used for AI and machine learning research and I have interfaced with enterprise systems written in python. It is not to be laughed at.,2018-01-23T03:11:29.813,1537
9788,4224,1,_@Buffy I don't see any problems with the box metapher. If we have multiple boxes we label them to distinguish them - just like we do give names to variables. And if we have really many of them we need to put some structure on it be it scoped names or arrays (rows of boxes). Regarding same shapes that's where most physical analogies break down. But first we would need to define the terms same and value anyway. In fact before introducing references/pointers/objects we do have multiple distinct but *equal* values in the boxes indeed - and some magical cloning device.,2018-01-23T03:20:40.127,660
9789,410,0,Back in the day  we learned 6502 assembly as @gypsyspellweaver siggests because it was what was available. We then hand assembled it (ugh) and put it into memory with poke statements. Of course we did this all from spec sheets since computing books didn't have enough circulation for economy of scale  and teachers didn't have the interest or time to dig past the BASIC.,2018-01-23T04:50:06.167,1537
9790,4213,0,Thank you everyone for your up votes I'm still dumbfounded that I managed to get enough reputation to comment in this community from one comment overnight. Thanks again guys hope my answer help(ed/s) :),2018-01-23T05:47:39.467,4036
9791,4218,1,The messiness depends on the assembly. ARM is less messy than x86 and arguably more useful too.,2018-01-23T08:28:39.460,1219
9795,219,1,You are missing 5 freedoms.  And the fact that a bunch of computing folks used an 0 indexed array as is kinda... expected.  OP is looking for non-computing examples like military time and people's age (as mentioned in other answers/comments),2018-01-23T14:26:22.137,662
9796,4216,0,For future reference the difference between static and dynamic typing. In some languages (Java...) type checking is done prior to execution (statically) usually by the compiler but possibly by another tool. In other languages (Python...) that isn't possible in general so typing is done at run time (dynamically). Statically typed languages are necessarily more verbose than a similar dynamically typed one as more type information usually needs to be included by the programmer. There are exceptions. Standard ML for example can statically type most programs without any type notations. Cool.,2018-01-23T14:37:36.067,1293
9799,4199,1,Names are references not variables. Yes in some modern languages most or all variables contain references but this is not the same and it is a subtly or not-so-subtly different concept which would likely make things more difficult for the child... for example humans usually never change their name; you have the identity stuff muddling stuff etc.,2018-01-23T16:34:59.303,652
9800,4235,0,Welcome to CSEducators. Your profile indicates a lot of interests. For this answer it would be good if you would expand it. Which exercises do you think are especially relevant to the question and why. (We value longer answers more than shorter ones here).,2018-01-23T16:53:21.927,1293
9801,4199,0,?€?In CS a variable can actually vary?€? ?€? I'd rather say in _imperative programming_ a variable can actually vary. CS per se doesn't need that.,2018-01-23T16:54:40.550,1157

9803,4235,0,I'd be happy to try to expand on it but I'm not quite sure what information I can provide that isn't redundant to the website.

I could copy/paste one of the activities I particularly like as an example perhaps?,2018-01-23T17:10:01.087,4106
9804,4173,0,The thing which is confusing you isn't the implementation but the name. `range` doesn't return a range in the sense of an object which represents a continuous subset of the real line. It returns an iterable/enumerable object which can be used to use foreach loops instead of C-style for loops for fixed start and end points.,2018-01-23T17:26:11.867,1219
9805,4219,2,Terrific answer. This also transitions well to the concept of pointers. Who is the president of the senate? You could *reference* the role of the vice president or you could use the *name* (value) of the vice president. Both are correct now but only one will still be correct a decade from now.,2018-01-23T18:59:02.887,4115
9806,4237,5,I would love to upvote this; it's probably a great answer!  But it brings up one very important housekeeping issue.

(There is an edit link just under your answer that you can use.),2018-01-23T19:00:41.000,27
9807,4219,11,President? Surely teacher is an easier concept for a child to grasp? At that age don't they get a new one every year juts as presidents change in your example? Or if they have one teacher per subject explain how the current teacher variable value changes as the subject or classroom changes? This might all vary by country but I think that school related concepts are easier to grasp than abstract concepts like leader of a country - whatever that is when you are 9,2018-01-23T19:38:03.057,4116

9814,4173,0,Exactly. The 2.7 implementation is not a range in the strict sense of the word so you have to know the library to use it.  The 3.0 implementation is exactly a range in the strictest sense of the word so anyone can read the code and see what it's doing.,2018-01-24T05:03:51.977,1537

9816,4202,0,I kind of want the metaphor to involve putting the sign on a different chest. (first the sign meant one chest then the sign meant a different chest the chest can vary this is called 'variable assignment' ),2018-01-24T11:33:56.730,1498
9817,4216,0,Python is dynamic but strongly-typed so you can't add 4 + fred. JavaScript is dynamic and weakly-typed so converts types in expressions and causes endless confusion.,2018-01-24T11:49:34.513,4131
9818,4198,1,_@Shayne Scratch is an object oriented system so there are objects (including values such as string and numbers) and there are variables which have names and refer to objects. You would have to unlearn the box metaphor once you try to put the same object into two boxes. This causes constant confusion in Java where references to objects are passed by value so people get taught that 'primitive' variables act like boxes and 'reference' variables are different despite the physical behaviour being identical.,2018-01-24T11:50:52.383,1498
9819,4243,1,This is a very interesting idea. Thanks for taking the time to answer and welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2018-01-24T12:32:30.517,58
9821,4197,0,_@Bergi you typically *don't* pass the box unless you start talking about references or pointers (which I suspect is not what you want to start with). In such analogy you would *open* the box and pass the content of the box as the result.,2018-01-24T13:11:52.160,4136
9824,4197,1,I can relate almost exactly to your daughter's predicament because when I was her age my older brother was struggling to explain simple variables in algebra to me. The mutability of a variable is the thing I couldn't wrap my head around at the time. I feel like that's the key concept to communicate but I'm still struggling with finding a way to explain it that my 9-year-old self would have understood. The accepted answer is definitely a good example but I'm not totally convinced I would have picked it up. Hopefully your daughter is smarter than I was ;),2018-01-24T14:28:41.093,4141
9830,4199,0,_@stuartstevenson bored and disenfranchised now or bored and disenfranchised later? I had this problem all through my childhood the older I got the better I was able to self motivate. My kids have it much better each school they have been in so far has had programs that try to tailor to the kids level. Early on I honestly feared that when when they moved on to middle school/high school the same sorts of programs wouldn't exist and being forced into a more traditional classroom would be too hard to adjust to. Seems my worry was for naught. (well until college.),2018-01-24T16:20:49.237,3891
9831,4250,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se].  This is a great first answer and we're always glad to have CS educators join us here.  :)  It sounds like you'll have a lot to contribute.  Feel free to ping me if you need any help navigating around while you get started.

9835,4247,0,Not the firs program but the first program is like one I have seen early in a course. The error I made is just an example of why you may need to re-edit.,2018-01-24T18:33:49.293,204
9836,4247,0,Could you add some advice as to how to introduce loops? (in python). I like to start with a `forever` loop in scratch. But python does not have them. [May be this is a new question],2018-01-24T18:37:41.927,204
9837,4247,0,What you have is fine but it is a lot for a first program. In python you can say while true: of course. You can also write a function that just loops forever and call it. Since you write it you can have it expect a lambda expression. (Caveat - I haven't worked out the details of this and tried to integrate it early but I think it would work.) Python is pretty flexible.,2018-01-24T18:52:56.643,1293
9838,4246,0,I just had a look I went to the examples. I see sliders I see buttons. I slide sliders I press button. But that is it nothing happens. Am I doing something wrong?,2018-01-24T18:53:56.757,204
9839,4219,1,_@Mawg That a 9-year-old could easily have multiple teachers muddies the waters so to localize things you could go with Principal of which there is only one in the entire school at any given time.  When I was 9 I knew that Lyndon Johnson was President.  (I was just a tad too young to know *why* he'd gotten the job in the first place which happened when I was 2.),2018-01-24T19:36:54.397,2208
9840,4197,0,_@aioobe Well that's exactly what's happening in a function call as well. We don't pass a variable as an argument we pass the value that the variable holds.,2018-01-24T20:27:38.480,660
9841,4219,4,Your last sentence put another way:  When we say that `x` is 40 what we really mean is that `x` is 40 ***right now***.,2018-01-24T20:57:12.793,1824
9842,4186,0,Processing is Java based. If that puts a knot in your stomach the Processing Foundation has extended their library to work with Python and Javascript.,2018-01-24T21:04:20.620,2040
9844,4201,1,_@diaa to be quite honest I'm not sure at what age exactly I started - especially because when I did start it was pretty on and off. I guess I probably started programming more seriously at...12? 13? but I've been programming since at least several years before that. I used Khan Academy alone to teach myself when I started out and then used codecademy to switch to python (and a little later found out about stack exchange/stack overflow which was super helpful). So - if that counts as self-taught yes? I never took a class to teach me.,2018-01-24T21:11:37.333,919
9846,4246,0,Most of the models have a Setup button then a Go button. I assume you're talking about the climate simulation which comes up first on the web version - it works if you press those two in order. (Typical code written by scientists ;-),2018-01-25T02:10:20.187,4131
9847,4200,0,Op's kid is heavily interested in science robots computers. Shouldn't they start at the beginning and learn algebra? (+1) IME learning equations that solve for X was easy. It's expressions that I don't like because there's no solution when there's more than one variable. If they understand mathematical expressions wouldn't they understand variables in computing? AFAIK you definitely need to understand what X means in an equation before you even touch expressions.,2018-01-25T02:41:16.423,4158
9848,4219,1,There are a few comments as to a better subject to convey mutability (leaders teachers) but if something more immediate is warranted I think you could do well with `day` - if you work on the program every day this var will be different until the end of the week when it becomes something it was already.  `Day` also leads to `hour` `minute` and `second` which means that you'll be writing a clock in no time.,2018-01-25T03:06:38.470,4159
9849,4197,0,The box analogy seems confusing asf to me. I do not have a logical brain though I am more of a creative.,2018-01-25T03:39:21.393,3413
9850,4197,0,_@Bergi well then I assume the question in your original comment (What does not feel correct about the box metapher?) is answered :-) Also note that not all languages have pass-by-value semantics. Pass-by-reference or mixes thereof is quite common.,2018-01-25T06:46:09.340,4136
9851,4197,0,_@aioobe I'd say this is why the box analogy is perfect: it can express both notions,2018-01-25T06:53:11.743,660
9853,4246,0,Thanks I tried that last time this time it worked (different models so that may be a factor).,2018-01-25T10:32:01.270,204
9854,4197,2,(I don't understand why my comment asking for more information was removed so I'll try to rephrase it.) Why do you think you need to *explain the concept* of a variable? Playing around with examples might be more natural for a 9-year-old understanding comes later.,2018-01-25T10:44:34.767,4101
9855,4198,0,_@PeteKirkham have a box labeled A with an orange in it. have two more boxes labeled B and C and put a note reading A into each. two notes one orange.,2018-01-25T11:18:28.827,3806
9856,4197,0,_@JiK That's how I personally learn best perhaps that qualifies as a full answer,2018-01-25T13:19:44.500,4141
9857,4256,1,That's a decent visual explanation. I feel like it would be understandable to a young learner even if they're not strong in the math department because it's less abstract than simply trying to explain the concept of a variable. Personally I'd approach it with only the blue cup for starters to keep it as simple as possible. Once they've got a basic understanding of that then introduce other variables like the red or clear cups or shift it to something other than numbers. Bonus points for the You are the program bit :),2018-01-25T13:27:59.533,4141
9858,4236,1,I really like how this example shows abstraction in a fairly intuitive way without having to directly define it,2018-01-25T13:33:07.587,4141
9859,4249,0,I'd need more practical examples of the maths tasks you'll need to do equations statistics 2D/3D graphs and so forth. I learnt all my maths by programming graphs because you change variables and you get instant feedback for your input. If you can find a colorful image generation program it's good to do some images. FooPlot is very basic. you should know how to write sines/cosines/and change their amplitudes and frequencies and also graph squares/powers. My own self learnign of maths was 1/making birdsongs and synths on Reaktor 5 builder 2/Milkdrop for winamp making images 3/Unity3D,2018-01-25T14:28:28.263,4174
9861,4257,0,Welcome to CSEducators. I think that was a great answer. Come back often.,2018-01-25T16:53:43.893,1293
9862,4236,0,Yes but as a first cut the definition of abstraction is pretty simple: A simple name for a complex thing so that the name can be used instead of the complexity.,2018-01-25T18:53:31.147,1293
9865,4198,1,That would correspond to a different case such as in C++ where you can have `a` as a pointer and `b` and `c` references to `a` (putting an apple in `a` would cause `b` and `c` to refer to the apple not the original orange),2018-01-26T08:37:57.183,1498
9867,4199,0,I disagree with the bit about variables in mathematics not varying - if you have: x = 2y you can draw a graph that shows how x and y vary in conjunction with one another.,2018-01-26T17:48:18.143,4195
9868,4069,0,_@AbdulAhad why would you need a specific operating system to do datamanipulation and file io?,2018-01-26T17:54:06.830,1868
9869,4199,0,Actually such a statement just defines a relationship between two values. There is nothing necessarily implied about _varying_ in it. It is _you_ that varies the values meaning mostly that you decide to explore several (or all) pairs in the relationship. A variable in say Java is quite a different thing.,2018-01-26T17:56:43.963,1293
9870,4219,1,_@gunfulker Yes! - so many confusing answers - just work through some simple examples with variables such as: currentYear birthYear age.   Then expand it with: legalDrivingAge yearLearnDriving etc etc.,2018-01-26T18:03:45.307,4195
9871,4197,0,When I first came across algebra at age 10 the thing that confused me wasn't that X and Y could be names for abstract things; it was that I had done lots of puzzles in which X and Y represented digits in a number so if X=2 and Y=3 then XY=23. No one explained to me that the things the letters stood for were quite different trom the things I thought they stood for and that the notation XY wasn't decimal notation it was multiplication. Very often in teaching it's not getting the right idea instilled that's difficult it's getting the wrong idea exorcised.,2018-01-26T19:00:56.400,2936
9872,4261,1,Unfortunately this view of OO needs work. If Animal is abstract or an interface then ok. But the sound an animal makes is not a good use of polymorphism (by inheritance anyway). Better it is a good use of programming by composition which OO also supports in fantastic ways. An animal _has a_ sound which is another object type. You can find better descriptions of OO and polymorphism given in many answers on this site. Have a look around. (Note that I've taught OO since about 1985),2018-01-26T20:37:12.150,1293

9874,4219,1,+1 I struggled a lot with this in particular trying to engage my 10 year old niece. This is a great way of thinking about it and is now going to be my go-to. Using 'teacher' as the variable word works too in the sense of Who is your 'teacher'? My 'teacher' is ____. I feel she'd grasp the concept that 'teacher' is something that can change even though 'teacher' holds someone's name to it,2018-01-26T22:08:08.477,4200
9876,4186,1,I'm happy to see Processing mentioned here. I teach students in the same age range as OP's and I this year I had to replace a teacher that had been using Pascal as an introductory language which the students hated.

9880,4069,0,_@gismo You don't. It's just my opinion that if you are working with C you should probably get familiar with Unix/Linux because that is what a lot of employers are using.

9897,4268,1,This kind of thinking doesn't scale. The whole purpose of using a meaningful boolean condition in a loop declaration is so that someone (who could well be yourself!) maintaining the code later can determine at a glance the approximate behavior and purpose of the loop. Writing loops this way forces you to later read every line of code to figure out even the most basic of behaviors; inner  `break` statements can be arbitrarily nested and thus arbitrarily complex.,2018-01-29T00:45:53.037,27
9898,4268,0,_@BenI.  I see student struggling to write loops because they're thinking about too many things at once.  Scaling is and should be their last concern when first learning loops.  However your point is taken in that we should teach scaling though perhaps not before the basic concepts of loops.,2018-01-29T01:10:11.350,3799
9899,4268,0,Interesting point and you may be right. I teach sophomores so they have already written loops before they see me.  Perhaps this could be a viable approach at the start.,2018-01-29T01:24:50.677,27

9913,4275,1,This is a very interesting answer. Welcome to [cseducators.se]! My only suggestion is that it might be helpful for you to draw a more direct connection between the question and the answer.,2018-01-29T15:33:06.253,58
9914,4275,1,I really like this perspective and I hadn't quite thought about it stated so simply and cleanly before.  (I also don't generally teach absolute beginners so I don't have a ton of experience having to clarify this particular idea.)  This also puts a nice punctuation mark on Bryan R.'s [observation](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/4271/27) I prefer to teach `while` loops as part of my unit on `if`/`else` statements since the syntax and thought process are virtually identical.,2018-01-29T15:54:27.007,27
9915,4275,0,While I agree that this is how they are usually implemented. This is back to the structured/un-structured high/low level argument that you were not here for. (yes I said usually: for example on the ARM ?€? the most popular ??? 32bit cpu on the planet at this time ?€? conditional and iteration are implemented different at the very low level. For a backward conditional branch of a loop the branch predictor assumes that the branch will happen. For a forward conditional of an if it is assumed not to happen. Arm also has conditional instructions. )  But thanks for contributing.,2018-01-29T16:09:36.330,204
9916,4275,1,*The only difference between an IF-Else and a Loop of any kind is whether you branch downward or back to the top* just isn't true.  DO...WHILE and LOOP...UNTIL and FOR X UNTIL Y STEP Z are nothing but (very useful) syntactic sugar laid over TEST and BRANCH.,2018-01-29T16:45:12.863,3132
9918,4275,0,_@RonJohn What you said is exactly what I got out of what user4226 posted. He also said that both if/else and all of the loop constructs are just test and branch.  What are you saying that is different?,2018-01-29T17:09:31.883,27
9919,4269,0,You could instead use `for(;;)` as your infinite loop example if you want to start with `for` loops.  It might be easier to explain that an infinite loop is one that doesn't have an exit condition at the top.,2018-01-29T19:09:56.693,753
9920,4275,0,_@BenI. I directly quoted this part that isn't true.  Specifically **whether you branch downward or back to the top**  Then I explained why.  Maybe I didn't do a good enough job though: you can have loops that check the condition at the top (WHILE...DO) and you can have loops that check the condition at the bottom (DO...WHILE).  However C and it's derivatives don't have DO...WHILE so it seems to have fallen out of favor.  I agree with everything else that user4226 (and Bryan R) wrote.,2018-01-29T19:17:07.513,3132
9921,4269,0,_@IllusiveBrian python does not have `for(;;)` and as you say I just have to explain that it has no exit condition so then have to explain exit condition. Though a different approach of saying that the `;` are separators we will look at what goes in the gaps latter my be preferable. As there is nothing for the students to try to ignore. It is easier to ignore nothing. Unfortunately this is not an option in python.,2018-01-29T19:37:16.960,204
9922,4275,0,_@RonJohn Oh I see.  The quibble was about whether the jump upwards was as a result of the test or whether it was an unconditional jump.  It still seems to reduce to the same basic idea: loops involve a jump backwards while `if`s involve a jump forwards.,2018-01-29T19:39:27.803,27

9924,4275,0,_@BenI. Correct that's my disagreement.  Here's what I'm talking about:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_while_loop and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop,2018-01-29T20:36:42.033,3132
9928,4241,1,Do you need `answer`?  `while input( Do you wish to continue? ) == yes: ...`,2018-01-30T03:27:52.207,4030
9929,4271,0,I've seen `for`-loops introduced after seing a lot of examples of `while`-loops with a counter that is incremented once per loop and seing the utility of a more compact way to do that.,2018-01-30T09:38:33.740,4234
9930,4277,0,Some good ideas however I am looking for advice on order to teach loops in a non-ideal language.,2018-01-30T10:02:00.060,204
9931,4280,0,nice answer. As I think that conditionals are over used I would prefer this: `user_wishes_to_continue = (answer == yes)`,2018-01-30T10:05:41.227,204
9932,4271,0,Makes sense. I was thinking that with an ideal language I would teach iteration before conditional. Conditional code is over used in most programs that I have seen. I have also done a proof that you can do any thing (Turing complete) without conditionals so long as you can loop. (also you only need 2 loops: the super loop and the container iterator). Try it for a challenge.,2018-01-30T10:13:38.950,204
9933,4275,0,_@RonJohn Hm C most certainly has a DO...WHILE construct. Did you mean that Python does not have it?,2018-01-30T10:45:50.280,4236
9935,4284,0,Hmmm. If `programShouldRun` is a variable then this isn't specifically an infinite loop. It may turn out to be but that depends on the future possible value of the variable. Constants are possible in Python but a deeper concept and language specific of course.,2018-01-30T12:25:12.820,1293
9936,4269,0,In my school we started with C and for loop was forbidden. You dont need it so dont use it.,2018-01-30T13:11:43.843,2833
9937,4284,0,Yeah that's definitely possible though on the other hand that could be used as a lead-in to the difference between an infinite loop and one that eventually terminates.   Up until now we've said that `programShouldRun` is always `True` but what do you think happens if we set it to `False` at the bottom of the loop?   Alternatively: So this program runs forever but we want to exit when [thing we are looking for]. Does anyone have any idea about how we'd go about fixing that?,2018-01-30T13:27:09.620,4239
9938,4284,0,But don't miss the point that the question was about _classifying_ loops. An infinite loop should clearly say semantically or syntactically that this loop is infinite. Controlling it specifically with a variable says just the opposite. It is about the meaning of the code not just about how it plays out. Students (and professionals) often write infinite loops by mistake forgetting to change a condition in some way. Your technique works only in a language that can clearly specify a constant value. For example an alternate symbol for True.,2018-01-30T13:49:38.143,1293
9939,4285,0,I don't know if it is still true but at a time in the past Dartmouth College had an Honor Code that sounds if I remember correctly quite a bit like what you say above especially your fourth point.,2018-01-30T13:53:56.030,1293

9945,4275,3,The importance of this answer is that it emphasizes underlying concepts. I think it can *help* not only hurt to teach this first - *un*structured control in various forms and then teach structured control. That presents an excellent opportunity to teach **why** structured control is preferable. IOW more or less follow the history -- the history itself evolved the way it did for good reasons. It's not just about teaching the use of a particular language; it's about teaching what's going on - *why* we do things the way we do. The various iteration constructs did not fall from the sky.,2018-01-30T15:31:34.910,4241
9946,4285,0,For rule 2 how does that work without being too onerous? When I try to solve a new problem (at work not school) I can end up opening dozens (hundreds?) of tabs searching for hints or answers.

9947,4285,0,_@mattumotu I have no answer for you other than I never have received more than about 15 sources on anything. I suppose that my students  naturally prioritize a little bit and omit items below a certain threshold of helpfulness. They haven't asked me for clarification about this either I'm afraid. I wish I could give you a more precise answer I can only say that it hasn't been a problem in practice for me.,2018-01-30T16:38:08.167,27

9951,4221,0,You beat me to this because of this question's protected status! Score is arguably the best way to teach a kid about a variable. In fact the score is a variable you use every day all the time. Watch a basketball game and ask what the Celtic's score is repeatedly throughout the game the score changes but it's still the score. It's a number it changes people talk about the score it's shown on the screen etc. Perfect example. Much less nebulous than a box that has a number in it. My second example would be Mad Libs.,2018-01-30T18:37:44.797,4082

9953,4286,3,You make a decent point in your answer but at least to me the abstract quoted by the OP reads like it's using excessive collaboration as an euphemism for having your friend do your schoolwork. I don't think you'd consider *that* kind of collaboration to be beneficial for learning.,2018-01-30T19:09:38.940,1439
9954,4286,0,Of course depending on what levels you teach at - say for an AS degree or other trade school level teaching - you may find that having students work only alone effectively breaks them for the job market.  The college I work for had a reputation of putting out AS graduates that really knew how to program in multiple languages... but they had lots of problems working with other programmers etc. and sharing code back and forth using various branches from a versioning system etc.,2018-01-30T19:33:59.183,662
9955,860,0,_@BenI. Can you possibly edit/expand your question a little bit to give some more information? For example: What are the other requirements of the course (curriculum)?

9971,4285,0,_@BenI. So what is the effective difference between someone who initially writes the code and understands how it works and someone who understands how it works? Seems like a waste of time trying to differentiate between these types of students since in the workplace they need to write code anyway. I'm someone who learns better by looking at solutions to complex problems and then applying the concepts extracted to new situations. The end result is someone who can translate an understanding of abstract concepts to working code.,2018-01-31T15:41:33.597,4246

In the case of art uniqueness is part of the value. Can we really say that for good code? The end result is two beautiful paintings or two functioning pieces of well-written code. I personally think the world would be better off with more good code. In the end you can't force people to be good at anything so trying to identify at-risk students seems rather pointless. You can either do the job or not.,2018-01-31T15:47:50.667,4246

Open source savants pretending they have no idea what late adopters are talking about when they reference some extremely well known function of a popular commercial software title. Getting down voted because the standards for general knowledge are so high etc. The elitism of the CS world is tied to the l33t h4x0r webisms of the late 90s.

9982,4293,0,Agree I will also add. Copyright infringement is often confused with plagiarism. However they are very different: Copyright infringement is using someone else's work without there permission. Plagiarism is using someone else's work and claiming it to be your own (usually but not only in academia). Thus plagiarism is a type of fraud where as Copyright infringement is copyright infringement (some would say theft but theft is to deprive someone of something so clearly it is not that).,2018-01-31T23:43:37.697,204
9983,4293,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Copyright infringement _is_ theft. If nothing more than taking away the creator's right to decide what is done with their creation.

9999,2897,0,`To never think that live would be easier without it` Historically people have had the same idea about having a HDD or having a network share or having a _backupped_ network share. Expectations change as the technology evolves. It's possible that in the near future Git will become the outdated approach compared to the newly developed tool which makes life so much easier and you'll be saying `To never think that live would be easier without [new tool]`. _This too will pass._,2018-02-02T14:53:50.057,2164
10000,4083,0,While interfaces are generally developed before the implementing class; that doesn't mean you have to teach in in the same order. Interfaces are built with a consideration to the future (the implementation) which means the student needs to know what implementation entails. Interfaces are the solution to a problem and therefore you must first showcase the problem to justify using the interface as a solution.,2018-02-02T15:06:00.533,2164
10001,4083,0,True enough but interfaces are also good in the thinking stage of problem solving when you are deciding what it is you need. They are like a rough sketch of the capabilities needed.,2018-02-02T15:29:08.257,1293

10004,4296,0,I don't agree 100% however there is a lot of interesting ideas in the answer. Do you know if there is any evidence that teaching in chronological order is of benefit. And a warning. If it is a benefit then we need to get our history right. OO was invented around 1960 (smalltalk) it also had the first mouse and windowing system.,2018-02-02T15:45:53.600,204

10006,3544,1,I love this answer but it seems to go after Microsoft rather unfairly. Of the big four major commercial Operating Systems (Windows OS X Android iOS) Windows hides the directory structure the least.  Apple is probably the big villain here.  They made an active decision starting with the iPod and iTunes that directories needed to be hidden and the world has been moving that way ever since.,2018-02-04T02:53:28.627,27

10010,3535,0,Hierarchical file systems are a direct evolution on flat systems  such as that of the IBM 360 architecture . Early in the lifespan of the 360 file sysyem programmers used a file naming convention that mimics a hierarchical system. Eg: pds.apps.jisadj3.pmb300 is a filename that tells people in a particular environment a lot about the file it looks like a directory path and tools have evolved over the decades that treat it as such but the os does not.,2018-02-04T14:30:59.000,1537

10020,4275,0,We do iterations not for the pleasure to do so but as a way to compute some results (say average of an array). Unstructured control is what the computer can do at its lower level. But what we do goes from divide sum by size then compute sum by adding all values then use a variable with initial value 0 and add each values and range over all array elements and use an index starting from 0 etc (if we dont have a foreach loop over collections) and LAST use a for/while/if-goto loop. We jump from the sky.,2018-02-07T10:13:37.567,2103

10028,4310,0,I think your answer has validity but I also note that most university curricula do actually have a discrete math course that is required of CS majors. It may be taught either by mathematicians (less programming) or by computer scientists (hopefully more). In a similar vein some university programs require at least some Calculus usually from the math department. There are tradeoffs of course. At a minimum courses from the math department may give an alternate way of looking at problems - a good thing.,2018-02-07T15:17:05.893,1293
10029,4306,0,I see what you're saying. However the problem remains: I am asking how can I *motivate* the students to try and make their code more abstract.  Don't get me wrong I'll definitely use Tell. Don't ask. . But that's not exactly the problem.,2018-02-07T16:43:21.963,150

10033,4307,3,Nice answer. We teach coding (even to students who won't become professional programmers) for the same reason we teach finger-painting (even to students who won't become professional artists). It allows them to express themselves it lets them think in different ways and some of them **will** become professional programmers or artists.,2018-02-07T19:14:26.080,2068
10036,3021,0,It seems like your problems are with your teams: Too many people on the project and not enough communication. I agree that you should generate it.

10067,4324,1,As an engineer I like $\cdot + \oplus \overline{A}$ but this is because it what I learned first. Also the associative distributive laws from multiplication and addition hold so that intuition carries over.

10088,4341,2,P.S. as other answers have pointed out you don't have to explain _binary_ floating point.  Decimal is easier to understand and if you talk about decimal then exponent just means move the decimal point this many places to the right or left.,2018-02-14T17:53:41.060,1269

10098,4159,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Don't think of Python3 as new and Python2 as old.  They are different languages and the developers still are coming up with new versions of both of them.,2018-02-16T21:14:07.593,1269
10099,4343,0,Yes a new language and a better one. Think anew about how you teach it.,2018-02-16T21:27:21.060,1293
10100,4304,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor Most of those people will never _program_ computers.  Not even when a complete programming language is built-in to the word-processor that they use every day.  IMO you should accept Buffy's answer.  Beyond the three R's the only reason we learn _anything_ in school is because learning makes us better people.  Learning in and of itself is a valuable life skill and school is where we learn how to learn.,2018-02-16T21:40:46.007,1269
10101,4159,0,_@jameslarge I know. It is true that python 3 is a newer language though. I also mostly prefer python3 (for an exception see my comment above).,2018-02-17T09:57:02.930,204
10102,4327,0,`^` is not same as `=`. The first is bitwise and works on `int`s. The second works on `bool`s (and is only true/false).,2018-02-17T10:29:38.067,204
10103,4327,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor you missed the in a purely boolean world part which is the context in which the statement holds true.  It's a way of helping them to intuitively understand the operation. When we start doing this with logic gates the difficult transition becomes understanding that the signals are themselves bits not the action of the XOR gate. That part remains intuitive.,2018-02-17T14:39:17.697,27
10104,4327,0,Oh I get it. For `bool` type that is single bit `!=` and `^` are the same. (Oh and I just noticed my typo in the comment above.),2018-02-17T17:23:30.690,204
10106,4346,0,Because you use the same algebra rules as if it is a $+$ because it is a $+$. Except $1=2$. See my answer on previous question. and $1\cdot1 = 1$ etc all as expected. But for $+$ it is as expected if $1=2$,2018-02-18T18:36:35.090,204
10108,4348,0,...12 possible inhabitants of the Cartesian cross product... This is what you would explain to an 11 year old?,2018-02-19T01:55:57.317,27
10109,4348,0,Yes you could simply list them.,2018-02-19T02:09:29.740,3799
10110,4326,0,_@immibis You would be surprised what people will do. First year students and veteran programmers alike. I have traced many bugs to that very concept: using the addition operator in Boolean logic because they learned Boolean algebra so well. I've even seen it done with `tinyint` in MySQL.,2018-02-19T05:54:50.407,104
10111,4326,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Rather than create a function to make it look legitimate why not not not inline and admit that it's a gludge? Shows exactly what's being done without having to make a function (probably will be optimized out during compilation anyway) and having to remember what `booleanNormalize` does every time it's encountered. Save several _bytes_ of file space as well.,2018-02-19T05:58:45.427,104
10112,4327,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Your Dvorak keyboard does make for interesting typos. :) Always a joy to translate the puzzle to see what you _meant_ to type.,2018-02-19T06:13:10.453,104
10113,4326,0,_@GypsySpellweaver same reason as always. Because it documents what the code does. Consider the alternative: You have to normalize after every operation. Same as when doing it by hand. To normalize you can do `!!a` where `a` is an integer that represents a boolean value.,2018-02-19T10:51:14.837,204
10115,4348,1,All well and good except the concept being taught is __Boolean logic__ not set theory. There are only ever _two_ possible answers using any operations. In addition `AND` has 4 possible combinations of inputs and `OR` _also_ has 4 possible combinations of inputs. Not a good time to explain the difference between Cartesian cross products and set union.,2018-02-19T18:23:15.580,104
10116,4312,0,Instead of site wide display changes that affect all clients (which you can do with careful search/replace) I'd instead focus on providing different views for different clients dynamically - print view high contrast (for vision disability) screen reader compatible  etc.,2018-02-20T02:03:07.350,662
10117,4330,0,The dungeon game works very well. Actually any tile-based game does. I would recommend that you take a look at GreenFoot.org because the design lab is much more impactful if your students can realize the designs.  GreenFoot will let you test your object design quickly. If you pre-plan your exercise you can introduce a great deal of OO material.,2018-02-20T17:42:53.393,3840
10118,4330,0,If you are looking some something small and quick - take a look at Greenfoot Kara. You can guide your class through re-creating it from design to implementation in controlled stages.,2018-02-20T17:47:06.033,3840
10119,4330,0,You can also introduce UML components to help focus on the design work,2018-02-20T17:49:30.290,3840
10120,4352,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Could you make this answer a little more detailed? I was not aware that Khan Academy covered much discrete math but a link to relevant sections would be very helpful to future visitors.,2018-02-21T02:14:00.093,27
10121,4352,0,_@BenI. Thanks for the feedback. I was talking about basic math skills as he mention in his question. For Discrete Math dunno if it has a branch dedicated to it I never searched for it. But Im sure they have something on Number theory I will put the link in the answer,2018-02-21T12:57:22.597,4323
10122,4353,1,I guess I'm confused. Your first example doesn't seem to allow other robot actions unless waiting_condition is quite complex. It reads like a blocking wait. The second example doesn't  seem to have any break at all unless an exception (or similar) happens elsewhere. Can you clarify? Do I need to get the RobotC specs to understand this?,2018-02-21T17:36:55.077,1293
10123,4335,1,Modern processor architectures usually have dedicated facilities for single-precision and double-precision computation (x86: see multiple variants of SSE and AVX). Single-precision computation typically provides significant performance advantages (in particular on GPUs) via higher throughput of functional units lowered bandwidth requirements and also provides energy savings. Now: Significant research into computing with mixed precision where most computation is done in single precision and only final refinements in double precision e.g. work by Stan Tomov and Jack Dongarra.,2018-02-21T17:46:34.280,1940
10124,4335,0,So the reason one could state for defaulting to double precision is: It is a convenient way to side-step various fairly difficult to understand (and possibly distracting) issues with numerical analysis in a *teaching* environment. Once the students get to the university level it will be important to understand these issues.,2018-02-21T17:50:45.057,1940
10125,4335,0,_@njuffa It sounds like you're hinting at a frame-challenging answer to the question.  If so have you considered creating an answer?,2018-02-21T20:22:34.743,27
10126,4353,0,I confess that I am also a bit confused about what you're asking.,2018-02-21T20:25:32.083,27
10127,4353,1,It looks more like you're trying to create event-driven functionality using flow-control statements. It also looks like you are trying to take the vestigial components of one program and extend them into something more than they can do. When the tool no longer serves your purposes find a better tool.,2018-02-22T00:04:16.773,104
10128,4351,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. Having input from the student's perspective can be quite helpful. Hope we see you around here often. Since you _have_ survived the education process and graduated can you now give specific examples that would have made a difference in how you and your classmates viewed the subject and what would have encouraged you to persevere and learn?,2018-02-22T00:30:24.983,104
10129,4353,0,I'm looking for the right example and practice tasks to create a guided inquiry cycle that will optimize student understanding of loop and conditional constructs using this platform. I'm also looking for greater insight (or something in the literature) to understand how this paradigm and context affects students new to CS.,2018-02-22T03:00:07.293,765
10130,4353,0,Gypsy helps me understand what to look for; the tasks that students come up with are state-based and event-driven. An example task might be after a button is pushed drive forward until a line taped on the floor is reached then follow the line to the right. Students who first learn about loops and conditionals using this approach (I think) conceive of loops and conditional differently than the students who first learn about loop and conditional structures say traversing and conditionally altering image pixels.,2018-02-22T03:00:12.733,765
10131,4353,0,_@BennettBrown Would you care to join the [chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) to discuss this question some?,2018-02-22T03:19:10.133,104
10132,4353,0,Some of the stuff in @GypsySpellweaver's answer (from the chat really) should really be integrated directly into this question.,2018-02-22T11:45:36.363,27
10133,4357,1,I think the 'while' and 'do until' examples need to have the termination condition flipped ...? The first does a task **while** a condition _remains_ true the other does a task **until** the condition _becomes_ true.,2018-02-22T15:14:58.713,3840
10134,4353,0,_@BennettBrown Typically instructors set up an exercise scaffold that the students can work with to complete their tasks.  The scaffold allows the students to experience some aspect of the environment without the risk of going off the rails.  Additionally the instructor can use the scaffolding to focus on the learning objectives and hide distracting details or mechanics.  This can be done by creating a library that is more readily usable by your students to accomplish set tasks.,2018-02-22T15:24:04.980,3840
10135,4353,0,_@BennettBrown In your example waitUntilDistanceSensorLessThan(200)  the robot is performing an action (moving)  external to the code (that is the software is not continuously sending a move_forward command) and receiving input from the sensor regarding distance that is being continuously checked. You (probably) cannot perform any actions until you arrive at your destination.  If you wish to have some means of controlling the robot while it is travelling you would need to integrate the check for request with the sensor loop.,2018-02-22T15:32:31.773,3840
10136,4353,0,_@BennettBrown Because your robot is performing asynchronous actions  (moving sensors etc.) you are seeing code examples in the form of do this forever while(true) as these are common techniques in these kinds of environments.  These ideas are worth exploring with your students as part of your class and will help provide a context for why the code is structured as it is.,2018-02-22T15:36:36.967,3840
10137,4353,0,_@BennettBrown A good example for the basis the asynchronous nature of the robots is to place a pit or non-detectable obstacle between it and the sensor limit. The robot will never reach its goal (sensor check) and can't be stopped (motor is running).  Both of these things are happening on H/W circuits that are independent of the S/W instructions.  It occurs to me that the designers probably already have some form of support for interrupting the execution of your running program -- as these kinds of errors are common.,2018-02-22T15:41:20.347,3840
10138,4357,0,_@MrBradley If the examples you refer to involve the motor movement then they were copied as-is from the referenced web site. If you're referring to a different section then I don't understand what you think should be flipped.,2018-02-22T16:41:55.053,104
10139,4353,0,_@MrBradley Maybe you can collect these comments and work them into your answer. I believe that these are good points and information that apply to the question's objective. Comments _are_ subject to being cleaned up and the list is often collapsed (I had to expand the list just to see the ones I new were here) while an answer does not suffer from those issues.,2018-02-22T16:53:06.667,104
10140,4357,0,the first code block following while vs until above.,2018-02-22T20:03:21.277,3840
10141,4357,0,_@MrBradley with the possible exception of Python which I don't know the two loops are correctly written.,2018-02-22T20:53:39.880,104
10143,4230,1,I think maybe it's time for __me__ to learn __C__. Even if I don't move from there to __C++__. Good answer and good resources.,2018-02-23T00:13:34.770,104
10144,4351,0,_@GypsySpellweaver thanks for the feedback but im not sure I understood your request quite well. Can you explain more or be more specific,2018-02-23T03:53:09.140,4323
10145,4351,0,Can you edit your answer to include some specific examples that would have been helpful to you. Examples for what could be made out of something you learned or how something you learned has an everyday life usage. Things that you didn't know then but have found or discovered since graduation. As you have graduated recently your memory of classwork is still moderately fresh and can still connect things taught in class to things in your life now. Some of us have been out of school so long that the memories are mostly cobwebs. Fresh eyes are helpful.,2018-02-23T04:04:12.720,104
10146,4361,0,Excellent answer. Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I hope we see you around more. We have a few questions that broach the subject of [tag:assembly] language level thinking here as well. Maybe you will find them interesting and worth answering.,2018-02-23T04:16:48.020,104
10147,32,1,Nice answer definitely agree it's not appropriate for people who don't know how to think of the right algo for simple stuff.  Asm is *much* easier to learn after you understand pointers (e.g. in C).  I found it pretty straightforward to learn from looking at how a compiler implemented the logic of my code using asm.  Once you have the mental model of registers as the architectural state and each instruction doing something specific to that state you understand the building blocks you can use to implement algorithms.,2018-02-23T05:11:14.743,1654
10150,32,0,I wouldn't say it's hard to read though.  Almost all computer languages are hard if you don't know them so yes of course it's hard for beginners to read but not a lot worse than C unless you don't even understand what registers are.  e.g. once you know one C-like language you can make some sense of most other languages that use similar syntax.  With asm I can usually make some sense of assembly language for architectures I barely know anything about because usually the mnemonics + context are enough of a hint to figure out load / store / move.,2018-02-23T05:27:40.517,1654
10151,32,0,And BTW OS-dev is a giant complication beyond just creating working algorithms in user-space.  Knowing some (or a lot) of asm is useful for performance tuning: e.g. looking at compiler output to see where you could [tweak the source to help the compiler](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40354978/why-is-this-c-code-faster-than-my-hand-written-assembly-for-testing-the-collat/40355466#40355466) or looking at `perf` (HW performance counter profiles) and none of that has anything to do with writing drivers or setting up x86 IDT/GDT / segment registers (or making BIOS calls).,2018-02-23T05:31:50.733,1654
10153,33,0,... or they'll become compiler developers / performance tuning experts.  I got into computer programming after messing around with electronics / digital logic as a hobby in high school and I've always loved knowing how things *really* work.  And now I code-golf in x86 machine code for fun :P,2018-02-23T06:01:02.057,1654
10154,642,0,Understanding that C compiles to asm is useful in debugging C programs with undefined behaviour.  e.g. if your program does something that shouldn't be possible or crashes in a really weird way then you probably did something wrong with a pointer to a local variable and stepped on something in the call stack.  IDK how far this gets you if you don't actually know asm (just that it exists) and don't have the expertise to backtrack from the symptoms to *what* might have been overwritten though.,2018-02-23T06:13:03.587,1654
10155,4259,0,I'm not an educator (except on SO) but I don't think it's very plausible to get to SSE / AVX (x86 SIMD) in 1 day if starting from scratch with students who don't yet know about registers and instructions / control flow.  A lot of SO questions have code with `jmp foo` / `foo:`  (i.e. jump over whitespace in the source to the next block of code).  IDK if that's sometimes left over from moving blocks around but very often there's a lack of understanding that execution continues to the next instruction on its own unless you specifically stop it. (Maybe branchless / SIMD code is actually easier?),2018-02-23T06:38:18.863,1654
10156,4242,0,Of course you don't write whole programs in asm.  You write hot loops or functions in asm and call them from C.  Modern compilers are fantastic at *large-scale* optimization making brittle asm that takes advantage of lots of things that happen to be true after inlining / constant-propagation.  Doing this around some hand-tuned code (small enough to be updated in future) can give great results.  Compilers definitely miss local optimizations sometimes.  Often you can use intrinsics to manually vectorize or something if the missed-optimization was auto-vectorization related though not asm.,2018-02-23T06:43:35.317,1654
10157,4242,0,As you point out actually hand-writing in asm tunes only for current microarchitectures so in my experience the best thing to do when performance tuning with future-proofing in mind is to read the compiler output and if the compiler didn't make optimal asm tweak the source to hand-hold it into finding a more optimal way to compile (See [my Collatz conjecture answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40355466/224132)).  Then you have nice asm with your current compiler for your current hardware.  Some future compiler can hopefully make different asm if needed for future hardware.,2018-02-23T06:48:24.723,1654
10161,4360,0,As ctrl-alt-delor commented much earlier the key to understanding float vs. double is the number of significant digits.  More specifically students should learn that computer arithmetic is *finite-precision* arithmetic.,2018-02-23T12:42:57.160,3524
10162,4351,0,_@GypsySpellweaver Its clear now I will try to write some useful ones.,2018-02-23T14:18:49.403,4323
10163,4364,6,Sorry but I'm not sure I understand the question. What are you asking? Can you summarize it in one or two sentences?,2018-02-23T18:18:28.347,2068
10164,4364,0,Possibly related: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/3881/is-there-some-meaningful-percentage-of-students-who-cant-learn-to-program,2018-02-23T18:22:26.440,2068
10165,4364,0,Welcome to CSEducators. A thought provoking question - assuming it _is_ a question.,2018-02-23T19:57:45.097,1293
10166,4366,1,Let me note that the other question here is specifically about programming. There is a lot more to CS than programming. Most CS folk do program but there are a lot of other things. Say theory.,2018-02-23T20:22:34.360,1293
10167,4364,1,It would be great also if you would register for the site and come visit with the regulars in the chatroom: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom,2018-02-23T21:14:25.300,1293
10170,4357,0,_@philipxy If either one has its test reversed then they they become operationally equivalent except for the timing of the test. The example then looses its demonstration of opposite effects for the same test condition.,2018-02-23T21:56:17.043,104
10171,4353,0,While & until are sequential control structures orthogonal to concurrent behaviour control. While vs until is a sequential programming semantics issue. Do not teach concurrent programming until sequential programming is understood. Busy waiting (your empty loop) is a notion that is part of the complex topic of concurrent execution model semantics & implementation. Learn & use the underlying concurrency model of particular libraries/languages for concurrent behaviour control.,2018-02-23T22:04:18.140,2485
10172,4357,0,Thanks. From your comment it seems the intro to the examples does not make clear what is being demonstrated. From the intro one expects them to show the same thing in two ways. I suspect you are trying to show something like 'if we use one structure in a way that would be equivalent but isn't because it doesn't invert the test then we don't get something equivalent'. But that's vacuous tortuous & torturous. Of course maybe that sentence is a straw man but I'm not sure that an intro that explicitly says what you are trying to demonstrate can be otherwise.,2018-02-23T22:45:17.407,2485
10173,4357,0,_@philipxy included in the answer is _The??while??loop exits when the test condition is??false??(fails) the??untilloop exits when the test condition is??true??(passes)._ Seems explicit to me,2018-02-23T22:50:47.273,104
10174,4357,0,_@philipxy Actually what that example is _demonstrating_ is the typical syntax of both statements in languages which _do_ have both available.,2018-02-23T22:59:49.907,104
10175,2632,0,Teach them to learn what things mean instead of guessing from how they look.,2018-02-23T23:16:29.260,2485
10176,4324,0,Good grief teach them that names are arbitrary.,2018-02-24T01:52:36.023,2485
10177,4364,0,I've voted to close this question because as other commenters have mentioned it's not very clear what you're asking. As far as I can tell you're asking about what good predictors of programming sucess which is quite broad. As @Buffy mentioned we'd be happy to help you clarify in [The Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom).,2018-02-24T02:51:25.013,58
10178,4369,1,Why not let them practice so they notice the difference between a variable and a value?   We all learn by doing mistakes.  Also consider using examples with numeric values.,2018-02-24T10:18:27.127,2103
10179,4371,0,+1 I love how you have re-cast the issue so that it puts the students into a good light. This is both a good approach and a dignified and loving one.,2018-02-24T14:44:17.880,27
10180,4371,0,Thanks. I note that a lot of issues like this are much more subtle than they appear at first glance. It is usually worth a second/deeper look before jumping to conclusions about ability and other things. I've said many times here that Your students are not like you.,2018-02-24T17:21:46.577,1293
10181,4377,1,Welcome to CSEducators. You show a sophisticated view of teaching that I hope you will bring back here often.,2018-02-25T23:29:35.317,1293
10182,4377,1,Agreed. Welcome to our community!,2018-02-25T23:53:29.773,27
10183,4377,1,Thank you Buffy and Ben I am excited to be here!  I hope to learn a lot!,2018-02-26T00:04:13.540,4338
10184,4361,0,_@GypsySpellweaver: I had a look at some of the questions but I don't know much about teaching asm to people who don't get it.  I literally don't understand why people find asm hard to learn because it wasn't for me.  It's like building a robot; you put some pieces together to create a machine that does something useful one step at a time.  I know some people don't get it but I don't know how to put myself inside their head to understand why not or if there's something you could tell them that would let them think about asm (and how computers work) in a useful way.,2018-02-26T02:03:54.967,1654
10185,4377,0,Now this is the kind of answers we need on this site. And six years of teaching might not qualify as research in you lexicon but most research is based on experiential data whether it's acknowledged or not. Along with Buffy and Ben I'm glad to see another thoughtful voice in on our site. __Welcome__,2018-02-26T02:11:36.680,104
10187,4374,0,Maybe things are different in the JavaScript world but I tend to read up on any Java or Python library I'm considering taking a dependency on including not just their documentation but also their test code and issue tracker.  That's how I get assessments like [_It's definitely not an early alpha any more but I'm not sure that people will get much joy out of using it in production_](https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper/issues/288)  So your question seems a bit strange to me: you want them to make their own decision about libraries for a (to them) large project but to do it really quickly?,2018-02-26T02:42:36.210,1102
10188,4361,0,It was worth a try anyway.,2018-02-26T02:45:39.810,104
10189,4333,0,_@pojo-guy: user-space x86 is fairly human-friendly especially in 32 or 64-bit mode.  (16-bit has less flexible addressing modes so not all registers can be used for pointers and segmentation is often actually used).  But writing a kernel for x86 requires dealing with segmentation or meaningless boilerplate to init segment registers if you don't understand it.  x86 is human-friendly if you know it well but it has a lot of quirks especially privileged instructions.,2018-02-26T03:02:46.250,1654
10190,4333,0,Also no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004 is a totally different architecture than 8086.  It has sixteen 4-bit registers.  Perhaps you meant you could run 8086 code on a modern x86?  That's true except that a 64-bit OS can't natively run in virtual-8086 (vm86) mode so you need either a virtual machine or to boot actual DOS or a 32-bit kernel to run 16-bit code natively or an emulator like DOSBOX.  And most old 8086 code uses DOS or BIOS system calls which have to be emulated under modern OSes.  Anyway yes it's interesting that you *could* boot DOS on a modern PC.,2018-02-26T03:07:28.500,1654
10191,4333,0,_@pojo-guy: And BTW stackoverflow gets a lot of questions about 16-bit x86 code the bulk of which are from people taking courses that use emu8086.  Most of us who follow the x86 and assembly tags thing this is a poor choice because there are lots of quirks to the DOS  `int 0x21` and BIOS ABI and so on.  And that x86 without instructions like `movzx` or shift counts other than 1 and `cl` is harder.  Segmentation is easy to learn if you already know asm but it's just very confusing if you don't.  Also emu8086's built-in assembler kinda sucks e.g. doesn't error on ambiguous operand-size.,2018-02-26T03:13:25.447,1654
10192,4333,0,_@PeterCordes Agreed - segmentation sucks and the DOS legacy stuff definitely doesn't help.,2018-02-26T03:51:29.703,1537
10193,4374,0,_@JeffreyBosboom somewhere in the middle. I'd like them to start learning how to make these decisions. That's the important bit. On the other hand thwre isn't infinite time.,2018-02-26T05:33:11.103,150
10194,4369,0,Do they notice after testing? Why did I get the word ?€?reply?€? appear in the log?  ?€?,2018-02-26T13:02:50.163,204
10195,4378,0,These are some points I hadn't thought of. Thanks,2018-02-26T17:32:24.523,150
10196,4382,12,I would add to this Leverage what your students know that you don't. A few years back my daughter's high school was brand new and setting up their video and media program. The teacher was a good teacher but a complete novice in the video production world. My daughter had been working on a live webcast team since 7th grade and had risen to the level of technical director by 11th grade. She pretty much set up the entire program freeing the teacher to learn and take care of non-technical concerns like budgets and school politics.,2018-02-26T19:14:13.700,1537
10197,4382,0,Also if you're creating your own multiple choice tests be prepared to get challenged. It is very easy to think you're writing a distractor answer that is false only to have students prove to you that it's also true.,2018-02-27T01:11:48.157,1401
10198,4383,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a really interesting answer! I hope to see you around the site more :),2018-02-27T03:42:49.203,58
10199,4384,0,Those are good additions. Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2018-02-27T11:39:01.800,27

10201,4381,4,With respect to your aside about undergraduate degrees in CS the first taught course in CS was a post-graduate Diploma at the University of Cambridge in 1953; Cambridge introduced an undergraduate Part II in 1970 as the third year of a science degree; expanded it to two years in 1978 (following one year of maths or science); and to three years (really 2.5 because half of the first year was still science) in 1989. Even today they don't have a full three year course of just CS although it's up to 2.75 years.

10202,4382,1,Ben you said everything I would have said.  Great answer.  I'll add two things: if teaching code be sure to write all exercises yourself before you assign them to students (or even concurrently in class - and I do this even if I know the language); use a timer to give yourself five or even 10 minutes during class when you need it to find your bearings or wrap your mind about what you're going to do next.  Tell your students that if they hit the wall while your timer is set they should investigate their problem independently (or get help from others) and that you'll be with them shortly.,2018-02-27T14:21:00.053,4338
10203,4382,1,_@JudyOakley Partial answers are considered answers here on SE and you have two great pieces there.  I'm particularly interested in your last bit; could you flesh that out?  I don't quite understand what you mean but it gives me a nagging sensation that there's a trick I could start enacting right away to make life better for me and my students.,2018-02-27T16:25:01.000,27
10204,4380,0,-1  for using Firstly Thirdly  instead of First Second ...  and for jumping from Firstly to Thirdly. Sorry it's a pet peeve of mine,2018-02-27T17:19:23.613,4350
10205,4380,0,_@QuoraFeans If you read carefully I have a secondly. Doesn't have a huge header but I do specify that there is a second stage...,2018-02-27T17:33:23.373,150
10207,4386,0,Good point. Trying to brazen your way out of a bad situation is almost always noticed by students. The teacher's reputation will be diminished. Life is much easier when you don't have to insist that you are perfect.,2018-02-28T01:03:24.437,1293
10209,4385,4,Good on you for even noticing the fact that he's creating opportunities. Often HS students don't take the time to think about the larger context of what their teachers are really doing for them. I don't fault them for that; they're young! But in my experience the kids who *do* notice are pretty special kids. :),2018-02-28T01:32:40.227,27
10210,4385,1,Also _welcome_ to [cseducators.se]. Having students here is quite helpful. Hope you can find other questions where your perspective can be helpful. Thank for joining the site.,2018-02-28T02:27:37.247,104
10211,4149,0,_@mehrdad but they make cool t-shirts!,2018-02-28T03:19:11.413,1537
10212,4381,1,_Learning how to learn is likely more important than any specific topic._ This.,2018-02-28T09:17:42.573,3194
10213,4379,3,How do you teach something when you don't know it yourself? .... badly ? (I just wanted to tell a joke). But joke aside the best teachers imo are those who have enough knowledge about the subject to be able to distill the important things from it and to give enough different point of views on it to help those who may not understand the first few tries to explain it. This requires deep enough knowledge of the subject matter.,2018-02-28T09:22:35.800,1002
10214,4379,2,This is the fundamental condition of teaching. There are always class members who get it more than you do. Your task life-long is to accept that cope with that and still provide teaching value even to those students.,2018-02-28T09:48:44.000,3202
10215,4379,0,Related: https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/86953/can-i-learn-the-course-material-for-the-first-time-while-im-teaching-it,2018-02-28T10:14:28.247,3173
10216,4389,1,There must be only one object of this class can be interpreted as a warning to the class users to use one UserSystem in an instance of an Application. If a program only needs one UserSystem the program could allocate and use a static one. Converting it to a singleton restricts its reuse.,2018-02-28T11:19:24.180,2103
10217,4380,1,This. This is really key and the other answers are helpful as well. As a physician I have had to teach medical students residents and PAs/CRNPs. Imagine the harm I could cause trying to bluff my way through teaching them about an illness. You either know it or you don't; when you don't you say I'll get back to you about that and then read about it yourself until you understand it. It's no different for any subject at any level; the students deserve to learn.,2018-03-01T01:50:20.103,4372
10218,4382,2,`in a high school for gifted students` ... are you Charles Xavier?,2018-03-01T14:53:25.687,4381
10219,4382,6,_@Hankrecords Yes yes I am.,2018-03-01T16:27:46.870,27
10220,4389,0,The singleton pattern you want as a solution to this problem is now consisted an antipattern. The preferred mechanism is to use a bean factory and scope the class as singleton. The correct fix would be to annotate the class with (at)Singleton or (at)Global (or whatever annotation your preferred bean factory prefers),2018-03-02T02:01:23.643,1537
10221,4391,0,The Java doc is almost always out of date irl so novices might read it  but the more experienced the programmer  the less likely they are too read it or to give it credence.,2018-03-02T02:03:41.667,1537
10222,4379,0,Did you consider giving your students an opportunity? As students we presented quite a few lectures ourselves. This is especially powerful with hands-on lectures. Especially with CS you're pretty likely to find a couple students that are already pretty good at things you're lacking in :),2018-03-02T08:45:36.620,1816
10223,4379,0,When I have had very small class or small part of learning then I model how to learn. We all learn together.,2018-03-02T13:51:19.647,204
10224,4379,0,When I was at uni. Two things happened. One annoyed me: The first the teacher was one/two ahead this encouraged me to try to overtake. However for me it was learning at 2nd/3rd language. The other the project/tutor told me I could not make a one bit digital to analogue converter (only 2 analogue components: speaker and a capacitor) as he was a digital specialist. This encouraged be to do it anyway.,2018-03-02T14:21:24.760,204
10225,4389,0,I nearly go what **you** wanted. I read ?€?There must be only one object of this class?€? and Identified that as a problem I was then looking for where the code was not re-entrant. As @pojo-guy says singleton is considered harmful. What if I want two or more objects of this class E.g. I am implementing authentication domains. It is not this classes responsibility. It is the responsibility of the factory.,2018-03-02T14:31:04.700,204
10226,4389,0,Singleton considered harmful aside. Don't make them guess. Tell them read the comment. Ask how do I implement the comment in code? So we can remove comment.,2018-03-02T14:33:02.510,204
10227,4389,0,_@pojo-guy a pattern is not an implementation. Singleton is an anti-pattern (no matter the implementation).,2018-03-02T14:38:55.600,204
10228,4389,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor  There are places for Singleton as any pattern. However it is badly overused. It should only be used when it simplifies the code.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12755539/why-is-singleton-considered-an-anti-pattern,2018-03-02T16:59:29.577,1537
10229,4389,1,_@pojo-guy I agree only use when it makes the code simpler consider first factory-pattern (so never). The only use is as a temporary kludge on a class that does not work if there is more than one instance. (So not because we **want** one instance but because we **can not** safely create more than one instance. Because of badly implemented class.),2018-03-02T23:39:21.647,204
10230,4389,0,Singleton should be built specifically to enforce thread safety features. Annotating as singleton is using a factory since it is the factory that understands the annotation and enforces the singleton in that case.,2018-03-03T02:42:23.107,1537
10231,4382,0,I will add an answer to the post but one other point is to make effective use of scaffolding for your assignments. This will help you as a new teacher contain the types of problems and questions students will run into as you become more familiar with the material.,2018-03-03T14:39:34.643,3840
10234,4406,2,You never got properly greeted when you joined us in January.  Welcome to [cseducators.se] and I hope we hear much more from you.,2018-03-05T14:27:18.987,27
10235,4406,0,_@BenI. Thanks! This is an interesting channel I hope it thrives.,2018-03-05T17:40:25.017,4082
10236,4408,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This answer is wonderful. If you can give an explanation\example regarding this tool from a teaching perspective it would be considerably  better. Either way welcome. I sure hope we'll see more quality content from you :),2018-03-05T18:22:52.680,150
10237,4408,0,Sure I can expand the answer.,2018-03-05T18:25:11.200,4401
10238,4321,0,Good answer. Short term goals and a connection to the instructor is important. Also in CS you are likely to be able to provide some examples of programmers/engineers/hackers that a young student would want to emulate. A lot of the motivation in technical courses was the professor or relative who I knew to be a practical joker who would pull of awesome pranks with their technical aptitude. Not a lot of kids spend their weekends winding their own tesla-coils without someone they want to impress.,2018-03-05T19:09:08.000,4082
10239,4193,0,There are two zero-knowledge demonstrations Two balls and the color-blind friend and Ali Baba's Cave described in the relevant Wikipedia article.  The first can be easily demonstrated in a classroom. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof,2018-03-05T19:22:16.313,3524
10240,3881,0,With coding it's possible to coast through some courses by memorizing some bits here and there without *really* learning it. Believe it or not the code snippet you have there involves a concept that *isn't* common sense that is not something she would have learned outside of a programming class. She might not understand starting conditions or order of execution. She might assume that there's a reason for -1 instead of any other invalid number.,2018-03-05T19:30:09.523,4082
10241,4321,0,_@GorchestopherH What a vivid image that is!,2018-03-05T23:31:11.033,27
10243,4411,0,*Remember that your job is not grading students but educating them.* + 1000,2018-03-05T23:55:38.063,2068
10246,4415,0,Hmmm. We college/university teachers may not in fact be the monsters you seem to imply we are. I also think that students in their future will tend to value those who show human qualities rather than keeping strictly to rules that have no exceptions (robot qualities). Yes I was seen as a very demanding teacher but I was at least after I learned to be always kind and understanding. I don't however disagree with all you say here.,2018-03-06T17:11:48.240,1293
10247,4415,0,_@Buffy To the unprepared student the harsh reality of most post-secondary credit systems *will* hit like a train. Students regularly fail and drop out of university courses taught by the most benevolent most talented least-monstrous professors possible because they will ill prepared and didn't take their tests seriously.,2018-03-06T17:45:49.647,4082
10248,4415,0,Perhaps but treating them badly (IMO) now so that they will be prepared to be treated badly later doesn't seem like the best solution. There must be a better way. However our chat room is a better place for this kind of discussion: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom,2018-03-06T17:59:06.977,1293
10249,4415,0,_@Buffy I can continue in chat but I'd like to state that I don't believe anything I'm suggesting nor the OP's current test practices constitutes treating them badly.,2018-03-06T18:17:55.550,4082
10250,3535,2,I love this question. I just hired someone who can't type. I stopped testing candidates for typing aptitude years ago... It seems that the Introduction to Computers of 20 years ago will become popular again. Introduction to Computers for the Critically Abstracted.,2018-03-06T19:04:17.673,4082
10251,4413,1,Jenny thanks for checking back in and glad to know we helped you! Could you integrate some of this information into the question or into comments on the question? While very lovely this isn't an answer.,2018-03-06T21:08:56.770,27
10252,4416,1,Can you provide some further context? Without more context this question is pretty broad and hard to answer well.,2018-03-07T02:58:53.873,58
10253,4416,4,I have a 4 year old and this seems rather ambitious but I commend the effort!,2018-03-07T03:09:12.463,4401
10254,4417,0,Have they been introduced to CSS?,2018-03-07T03:20:12.890,4401
10255,4417,0,_@JedSchneider Yes they have. It's in their stylesheets where they consistently use absolute positioning. Also when I ask them to avoid it they can't seem to do it unless I effectively feed them the code. And in that case they're just copying what I say not learning anything.,2018-03-07T03:32:21.827,58
10256,4416,5,Pre-school meaning that they're just learning to hand-write letters and can't reliably read words?,2018-03-07T09:33:05.740,27
10257,4416,0,This is a really interesting question.,2018-03-07T09:34:58.660,27
10258,4417,0,In my experience even feeding them code eventually takes root.  And some students have to be fed in this way for a long time before that light goes on in their heads.  If you can continue to patiently remind and explain.,2018-03-07T12:46:19.823,4338
10259,4415,0,Thank you @GorchestopherH for your response.  I agree with a lot of what you say.  I try to walk the thin line of being kind to my students and developing relationships with them while at the same time preparing them for the harsh realities of life in secondary education.  I also do not think this constitutes treating them badly nor do I think this in any way implies that college/university professors are monsters.  I know you guys took this to the chat room so if you have a response I'll be glad to join you there.,2018-03-07T13:14:22.050,4338
10260,4416,0,_@BenI. yes exactly,2018-03-07T14:08:57.787,4407
10261,4415,0,_@JudyOakley In chat it was boiled down to a difference of opinion. Some feel it is cruel to treat classes at different levels differently. If you feel this way then I'd recommend against test corrections. Test corrections will not exist throughout their entire academic career and if you can't ween the students off then stay away. You **do** need a way to encourage students to learn concepts they they are deficient in this does not have to be in the form of test corrections.,2018-03-07T16:23:26.577,4082
10262,4418,0,Great points here. Show the students why absolute positioning isn't great for the web where the viewport could be any set of dimensions.,2018-03-07T18:29:32.743,4082
10263,4417,1,Perhaps the students were introduced to the absolute positioning properties too early? It's very hard to learn to do something in-place-of something else you already know how to do. If course time permits maybe you need to re-introduce the topic of layout with some very simple examples such as those on this page: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp,2018-03-07T18:44:26.330,4082
10264,502,1,We really do need a language referenced. GoTo is not always bad. Try using Basic without GoTo or assembly without JMP ...or JE. In fact there are many industrial languages used today where GoTo is absolutely required. There are best practices for most languages and they don't always agree.,2018-03-07T18:50:03.373,4082
10265,4416,1,I recommend the following textbook: https://www.amazon.ca/Peek-Boo-Friends-Parragon-Books/dp/1472305922/ While not explicitly a text on cryptographic hash functions it can demonstrate the concept of a blockchain to preschoolers. Each page has a window back to the previous page and forward to the next page these windows allow verification that the current page indeed follows the previous allowing the student an early appreciation for blockchain suitable for a preschooler.,2018-03-07T19:04:09.827,4082
10266,4410,1,Depends: Are you trying to facilitate learning or measure ability. If the First then see Carol Dwekes work and give grades of ?€?Not passed yet?€? or ?€?60% so far?€?. If the second then do an entrance exam but the grade in a box and re-issue on graduation (you don't want to affect what you are measuring).,2018-03-07T19:08:29.337,204
10267,4416,2,I don't thing that hashing and block chains are the same thing however block chains will use hashes.,2018-03-07T19:12:10.293,204
10268,4389,0,When asking design issues questions you may want to make your questions....er...more specific? Any of those answers from your students could be design problems. If you want them to identify if the class' declaration is appropriate why not simply ask for a appropriate declaration for a class that is to only have one instance?,2018-03-07T19:48:45.353,4082
10269,342,0,There's two big concepts here that are not fully common sense. The concept of a variable and order of operations. These are operations or steps not truths these are variables not unknown constants.,2018-03-07T19:56:59.693,4082

10271,4418,0,I just tried this page in responsive design mode. It is a mess unless you trick the server into thinking you are on a phone. If it thinks you have a desktop then in assumes that you have a wide (>1024) screen. The style sets min-width multiple times.

10273,4416,0,I'm sticking with my textbook recommendation. Perhaps the author will consider re-titling it A Course in Pre-Blockchain Theory for Toddlers.,2018-03-08T12:03:23.320,4082
10274,2897,1,Good luck my friend. I personally would not attempt to teach Git at that level. It's more of a workplace training type of thing.

10308,4428,4,I think that caveat is more important than calling it a caveat may suggest. I'm of the opinion that clear and understandable code is priority #1 (well maybe #2 after _working_ code) and all other rules can be bent to that aim. But if you do want to have a general principle about early returns I definitely agree that allowing and even encouraging them seems like a better choice than forbidding them for exactly the reasons you describe.,2018-03-09T23:16:51.510,1357

10325,4442,0,Sorry not convincing in most cases. Three helpers is no more infeasible than three code blocks. Nor is is more or less likely to call them in the wrong order vs to order the blocks wrongly. You are closer though if the helpers require excessive args or return values but then I suspect the code is already so obfuscated that abstracting out this structure doesn't help you much. Probably it need a complete rethinking rather than just throwing more code in one function. Your Do thing... sections should probably be factored out for example. I trust you that code like this exists frequently.,2018-03-10T02:00:50.557,1293

10329,4442,2,_@Buffy: Expanded and revised.  But regardless of your personal opinion it should be emphasized that Linus won't accept pull requests which use helper functions.  So if you plan to submit code to Linux or Git you *must* use the `goto` cleanup method even if you hate it.,2018-03-10T02:31:10.673,1896
10330,4442,0,The structure of the code is this. It is a nest of shells (3 or 4 depending). Each shell say the do C shell tries something that might fail. If it fails it cleans up after _itself_ and may signal a containing shell. The do B shell has the same structure except that it contains the do C shell. It tries something and cleans up after _itself_  if needed and passes error codes to outer any shell (including failure of do C). If you code it that way it is much simpler. You don't have to think about much but getting each level correct. That is what you are trying to achieve here I think.,2018-03-10T02:43:51.587,1293
10331,4442,0,Moreover it doesn't contradict the return as early as you can idea. Each shell can do that of course if no cleanup is needed but an outer shell can't return until a contained shell does. But that is just the same as occurs when one function calls another. I won't try to stand between you and Linus of course.,2018-03-10T02:49:11.003,1293
10332,4442,4,but an outer shell can't return until a contained shell does - Don't you see that the `goto` statements functionally *are* returns?,2018-03-10T03:44:53.727,1896
10333,4442,1,I also took the liberty of writing a *real* example which I think makes it very clear that helper functions would be much harder to read.,2018-03-10T04:04:22.350,1896

10335,4426,26,Sadly the dual meanings is likely due to manufacturers trying to avoid confusion in the minds of unsophisticated customers More likely it is advertisers wanting their product to sound larger than it really is.

10418,4431,5,I'd also teach to **read the context**: four kay being for things like block sizes or amounts of memory is *almost always* going to mean 4096. If someone colloquially says sixty-four kay of flash when talking about a microcontroller that means 65536 bytes (maybe missing some). If someone says 2 gigs of memory when talking about RAM that means 2 GiB. By way of contrast I've never heard an Ethernet frame quoted as being 1.5 kay or 9 kay because that would be misleading/confusing. Mass storage is the thing at fault here.,2018-03-12T00:41:54.687,4535
10419,4416,0,Are preschoolers really going to understand any math you show them? In my memory they barely even know about numbers at that age. You'd probably have to go to a physical analogy if you wanted the kids to understand. Would that be reasonable to you given that you did specifically ask for a hash function?,2018-03-12T02:45:06.497,4538
10420,4426,0,_@NicHartley It can equally well be argued that that is because *you* are misinterpreting what a TB is..,2018-03-12T04:17:49.063,1275
10421,4441,2,In what way is number 3 the only useful definition?,2018-03-12T04:19:22.397,1275
10423,4431,1,_@Willtech There used to be reasons why 1024 byte powers were convenient but they no longer apply with more advanced technology that is capable of dividing by 1000.,2018-03-12T04:27:52.847,1275
10424,4431,3,_@immibis has how RAM is manufactured changed? It is still binarily addressable in structure.,2018-03-12T04:33:35.767,4513
10425,4431,3,_@Willtech RAM is only a small slice of the things that are measured in bytes and most other things (such as hard drives) have no reason to have power-of-two sizes. Modern systems are also much more able to deal with NPOT sizes - for example we no longer want to hard-wire address decoders using the minimal number of gates. By the way modern memory chips actually include spare rows to automatically replace faulty ones so that proves they can make any number of rows (because the total isn't a power of two).,2018-03-12T04:46:45.950,1275
10427,4426,4,_@immibis Oh for sure. It's just two different standards. Of course it's still an unfair representation because they know full well that their users' computers will use the base-2 versions so when they're expecting their computer to say 3 terabytes they'll actually get 2.7.,2018-03-12T05:25:36.950,2655
10428,4431,0,_@immibis When we invent technology like PAE that doesn't justify limiting paging to 01110111001101011001010000000000 bytes.,2018-03-12T05:30:35.057,4513
10429,4431,0,Alright most addressing is probably in hex values but it is compatible with binary.,2018-03-12T05:48:33.740,4513
10432,4431,1,You should teach a generalization of @R.. 's excellent comment: *Just because an standard exists doesn't mean people like or actually use it.*. I **wish** they had taught me that. Then I would still encourage them to use standards whenever practical (instead of [reinventing the wheel](https://xkcd.com/927/)) even if it means jumping through a couple of hoops.,2018-03-12T08:35:16.230,994
10433,4431,5,Just to add to this though prepare your students for the fact that they will almost certainly never find anyone using the word kibibyte in the real world. I've been working in software for 20+ years as well as spending years building my own PCs and I've never once seen it used. Occasionally I've seen people write KiB - and it's always read as kilobytes. Even that is a small minority of cases though.,2018-03-12T09:14:02.343,1864
10434,4446,1,IMO this is the best answer but it could be slightly improved by explicit mention of *style*. I.e. in the same way that there are different styles for citing papers or for delimiting lists (vide Oxford comma) there are different styles for formatting numbers. In an IEC publication post-2000 you can assume that house style will be SI / *bi. Other organisations / publishers may use other styles.,2018-03-12T09:56:41.913,1219
10437,4442,0,converting the above example into a flag-based design will result in an excess of if statements which are too numerous here already.  Too numerous for whom?  You have a nesting conditional structure which can *and should* be represented neatly with if statements.  Instead your code has deliberately obfuscated that structure which makes it harder to maintain.  If there was a performance benefit then perhaps you could justify it but there isn't.  Thank you though for a great example of an anti-pattern - I will use this myself for people I mentor to literally show them how not to do it.,2018-03-12T11:50:35.983,1864

10440,4428,0,_@DavidZ After priority #1 (working code) isn't just about any design pattern and rule we have ever heard about just a means to fulfill priority #2? Thus not only _can_ rules be bent but they _should_ be bent to that aim if it clears up code. Of course whether your own code is clear is not always easy to judge so we have rules to give people objecive criteria they can hang on to.,2018-03-12T13:22:23.623,4234

10446,4438,0,_@DoctorJones I wouldn't say probably as a lot of shops won't have something like this formally documented. ;) And unless you're working on something that's life and death a standard to this level of detail is probably too heavy weight. But yes they should be aware that it's possible.,2018-03-12T15:30:41.870,981
10451,4425,12,What I find amusing is that the power-of-two version (The one that's clearly what is usually desired) has no justification whatsoever for the use of the Kilo prefix--it's just that some arbitrary power of two happens to come fairly close to some arbitrary power of 10 so we ignore the difference for the convenience of being able to say K (or M or G) because 0x0200abyte is too hard to say.,2018-03-12T16:08:42.747,1399

10460,4425,1,_@BillK I was going to say the same thing - we religiously fight for K=1024 and we completely forget that kilo was invented long time before computers and associating it with 1024 was nothing but a steal - convenient but highly improper. If 2^10 was say 1256 then for sure we wouldn't call it a kilo byte.,2018-03-12T20:11:14.573,4582
10461,4457,0,+1. You absolutely need to teach the formal definition or the rules and not just examples. Rule first then examples. Maybe I misread the other answers to this question but I agree that you have to know *why* an integer is an integer or *why* a set is a set or how a class is defined. If you don't know the rules you may never know how they work in the wild. How many examples of a set would you have to see before you infer the single sentence that defines a set?,2018-03-12T20:19:57.300,4082

10491,4468,2,I agree that group/paired programming can be frustrating to stars and I certainly don't wish to squelch their enthusiasm and creativity.  But I as a teacher am evaluated on among other things inclusion of group projects.  Indeed student collaboration is one of the overarching goals of my district.  So it's THERE whether I or they like it or not.  And mustn't we all at some point be able to work with others even if it is frustrating or slows us down?  How many Knuths are there in the world?  Who are ALLOWED/ENCOURAGED to work alone because they are superstars?  Not many.,2018-03-13T20:26:03.267,4338

10493,4468,3,I agree with @JudyOakley here. Student's need more in their education than technology. The workplace demands it. So does being successful in many Colleges and certainly in Grad School. Your introverts aren't well served by letting them hide and your superstars aren't well served by letting them work in too narrow a range. Some education is hard. But _what_ is hard is different for everyone.,2018-03-13T20:29:56.907,1293

10495,4462,1,I'm with @BenI.  I don't believe they cannot.  I've seen it happen too many times in my classroom - a high school student struggles and struggles to learn programming.  They don't come naturally to it.  It takes them three times as long to do projects.  They have to be told/shown correct syntax over and over.  They have no logic skills.  But they work hard.  They stay at lunch.  They stay after school.  They WANT to be a programmer.  And they eventually slowly become one.

10496,4470,3,you are right on the money and in a good classroom environment these things will happen organically.  In my current project which initiated this question I've had two groups go Dream Team on me and implement far and above their specifications.  This has in turn fueled other teams to want to get finished so we can try to do that.  It's awesome and amazing.  I don't know if I could formalize it in the future...but I can maintain a classroom that fosters openness and curiosity so that students feel free to do such.,2018-03-13T21:00:07.280,4338

10500,4470,1,I would still try something different. Homogeneity doesn't let them grow. One option is to make your superstars tutors or teaching assistants. If your project has roles give them a non-programming role since they won't learn much from just programming if they already excel there. Or a tester role. Or a tool builder role. But best if they can also learn to work with others. As a tool builder the rest of the team becomes their customer similar for tester. They have to interact but can't just take over.,2018-03-13T22:59:28.260,1293

10516,4425,1,_@l0b0 There is an actual reason for using 1024 byte fields. Because the number of bits you need to address the bytes allows up to 1024 bytes. Using 1000 is fine but your address space allows 24 more bytes so why don't you use them? So 1024 is an binary even number for a reason not just cargo cult.,2018-03-14T08:33:21.477,4631
10517,4425,1,_@allo What do you mean allows up to 1024 bytes? You're going to have to specify what you are referring to if you're making such a claim otherwise it's still cargo cult.,2018-03-14T08:38:04.167,2972
10518,4425,0,Lets say you have a string of 1024 bytes. Then you can use 10 bits to address any character in this string. Make it 1025 bytes and you need 11 bits. Make it 1000 bytes and you got some addresses left over. Most the time the constraint on the address length is harder than on the field itself. So making it 1024 is quite nice when you need at least 1000 bytes while avoiding to need 1025 is a good idea.,2018-03-14T08:40:50.267,4631

10527,4465,6,Intentionally restricting the work of the most productive team members is only likely to drive them to drop the class.  *Functional* engineering organizations fully use the capability of all of their members -  once you create a system that *by design* does not you model a dysfunctional organization with an official path where little happens an unofficial one where all the real work gets done and a huge tension in between.,2018-03-14T15:40:44.580,1308

10529,4446,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor: I agree that the use of uppercase M for 1E6 and lowercase m for 1E-3 and lowercase mu for 1E-6 along with the fact that uppercase Mu looks like an uppercase M means there's no M-like letter available for anything else.  From a pronunciation standpoint using letter names for powers of two e.g. 4 em-bytes 2 gee-bytes or even 1.44 kilo-kay bytes [the floppy size] would seem good.  The only problem is with the written form.,2018-03-14T15:59:20.430,2073

10533,4470,3,_@Buffy I disagree. Most companies set up homogeneity in order to complete the most complex projects. Pairing the high fliers is realistic and will help them grow technical-skill-wise (AKA the point of the class). You're severely underestimating the skill-ceiling of programming. No human has ever reached a point where they are unable to continue learning programming. There are plenty of other classes to teach the skills you are suggesting and practice them.,2018-03-14T16:10:11.457,2719
10535,4442,0,I prefer to avoid helper functions as described in this answer. Instead I try to take a different approach _where viable_; that is to have a function or functions that do the work _only_ do the work. They are called from a memory management function that only does the setup and the cleaning up.  I can return early or do anything else in the work function and when I do the clean-up is handled as part of the return from the function instead of the function explicitly having to clean up after itself worker function or not.,2018-03-14T16:24:16.723,993
10536,4447,0,Some languages make one style prevalent over the other.  Some other languages are more flexible and different coding styles can be used.  What you do there can be defined either by the style or the algorithm itself - you do what is cleanest.,2018-03-14T16:26:14.903,993
10538,4474,0,_@pojo-guy I see better where you're coming from. OP has indicated in a comment that she is also evaluated on student teamwork. Obviously there are a lot of headwinds but if you were the teacher in that position how would you attempt to approach students such as yourself? We don't need to achieve total success in one project. Baby steps can still be important in the development of a student. But how would you encourage such baby steps in ways that don't dehumanize or invalidate the student? In some ways you may be the best person here to answer this question so far.,2018-03-14T17:09:04.463,27

10542,4468,0,_@LeeMosher Interesting point. Personally I think that answers like this should be okay.

10544,4436,0,_@supercat em-byte sounds like an abbreviation of megabyte. It therefore doesn't resolve the ambiguity the way MiB does.

10545,4436,0,_@MontyHarder: I don't mind the written form MiB nearly as much as the pronunciation.  The pronunciation of Blvd. is boulevard not bull-vid.  One might have to tweak a pronunciation rule slightly to say that if letters are pronounced for both the prefix and the unit [e.g kay-gee for mass or kay-em for distance] then the power-of-ten prefix applies.  I think bits and bytes are usually pronounced as words however rather than as bee.,2018-03-14T20:16:56.837,2073
10546,4426,0,@immibis For the record with Linux if you look at ls(1) you'll see: *`--block-size=SIZE    scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g. '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of 1048576 bytes; see SIZE format below`* and *`The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are KMGTPEZY (powers of 1024) or KBMB... (powers of 1000).`* I don't know about other tools off hand I just remember it typically being 2^10. On one of my smaller disks in this box: *`Disk /dev/sda: 931.5 GiB 1000204886016 bytes 1953525168 sectors`* (fdisk output).,2018-03-14T20:47:11.640,4650
10547,4426,0,_@immibis As for the syscall stat(2): *`off_t     st_size; /* Total size in bytes */   blksize_t st_blksize;     /* Block size for filesystem I/O */ blkcnt_t  st_blocks;      /* Number of 512B blocks allocated */`* All in all the idea of having more than just the 2^10 version was a terrible idea.,2018-03-14T20:49:46.710,4650

10549,4436,0,_@supercat If I speak one part of the actual word I will speak it all; so I'd say kilobyte but I'd not say Kbyte like that (more so Kbyte I'd pronounce kilobyte). I'd pronounce KB as the two letters individually. Maybe you're not saying that but in case you are that's how I would do it. I commend anyone who actually goes further than the binary way but I just can't for whatever reason. I'm not sure it's that I'm stubborn (although that's part of it).  Even then MiB looks awful to me. Unfortunately language is meant to communicate and the double standards here complicate matters but what to do?,2018-03-14T21:18:13.747,4650
10550,4430,0,_@rexkogitans It was Kbps for Kilobits per second. Of course some networking utilities would scale it to bytes and that would be KB/s (usually something like that) but the modems were Kbps just like now it might be Mbps or Gbps (and so on). Or if you're extremely unlikely yes Kbps. (Perhaps some wrote it as kbps though),2018-03-14T21:22:55.487,4650
10551,4436,0,_@Pryftan: I would pronounce 65536 bytes as sixty-four kay-bytes and a 32768Hz signal as thirty-two kay-hertz.  The use of a pronounced letter only for the prefix indicates at least to my ear a meaning different from pronouncing the metric prefix.,2018-03-14T21:27:46.260,2073
10552,4431,1,_@JohnPeyton: Uppercase K has been widely recognized as unambiguously meaning 1024 at least in contexts that would support using a lowercase k when appropriate for 40+ years; the notion that there's anything wrong with that notation is far more recent.,2018-03-14T21:35:40.503,2073
10553,4436,0,_@supercat Fair enough. I'm not saying you're wrong of course; I'm just saying how I would do it. I'm unsure how I would pronounce your examples but possibly literally the way you wrote them. In any event I never say K-bits or M-bits; I either say kilobits or megabits or Kb/Mb (or whatever). Similarly Mbps I say megabits per second. And I thought the mess was bad enough; apparently it's even more confusing. Such is life when you have unwise standard changes (in one version of *`accept(2)`* Linus cited another example this one being a blunder of POSIX and how they tried to save face).,2018-03-14T21:35:50.987,4650
10554,4431,1,_@supercat I'm not sure I would admit that such usage is unambiguous given that the prefix has been defined as meaning 1000 for centuries. And the same applies to the prefixes M G etc. which have no such case distinction to help.,2018-03-14T21:39:33.603,4621

10556,4425,0,When the largest memory was 32k it wasn't as confusing.  To anyone who entered the computing biz before about 1990 K=1024 and M= 1048576 (when describing RAM/disk storage size).  But this is confusing when a 64K RAM is  65535 bytes and also confusing when 64kHz is 64000 Hz.  IBM decided to change the notation back maybe 1990 and most of the rest of the industry went along some (the old big iron crowd) grudgingly some (the new consumer computer biz) more happily.,2018-03-14T21:53:37.087,4511
10557,4431,1,_@JohnPeyton: When has the uppercase version been defined as a prefix meaning 1000 other than in contexts where lowercase would have been unavailable?  I agree the larger prefixes have always been a problem though I'm a bit curious as to why there's only now an interest in changing them?  If someone had proposed new terms in the 1970s that would have been much more useful than redefining the terms after decades of use.,2018-03-14T22:07:15.740,2073
10558,4426,0,_@Pryftan 512B isn't any of the above units. At best it's 0.5 KiB. But who wants to be mixing powers-of-10 fractions with power-of-1024 units? How much is 0.1 KiB?,2018-03-14T22:28:07.047,1275
10559,4426,0,_@immibis: 0.5 is an exact base-ten representation of a power-of-two fraction.,2018-03-14T22:33:23.193,2073
10560,4469,0,Many companies still (mis)use waterfall. It has the advantage that it ensures there is a high level vision but the disadvantage that managers have got their hands on it and ruined it like they are trying to do to agile.,2018-03-14T23:41:06.613,1537
10561,4474,0,_@BenI. Evaluating the teacher on my ability to work in a group would have been exactly analogous to evaluating the track coach on his ability to take a one legged student and get him to sprint 100 yards except the missing leg was more visible. I know it's how some super-social bureaucrat who wouldn't know a copybook from a class decided to evaluate teachers but it's unreasonable and unrelated to either the teacher's skill or the student's learning.,2018-03-15T00:13:42.027,1537
10562,4469,0,Original waterfall was actually agile. The intent (before MBA's got their hands on it) was an illustration that the sooner you fix errors the less they cost to fix. Code well know where you plan to go and fix issues early - pretty much the definition of Agile.,2018-03-15T00:21:04.213,1537
10563,4469,0,_@pojo-guy sorry but that is a misrepresentation of agile process. Agility is about responding to change not about getting it all absolutely correct at the start (which is impossible in a changing world). You are confusing/obfuscating the issues rather than offering useful commentary.,2018-03-15T00:25:06.723,1293

10566,4469,0,No it was not. The sorts of things you do in waterfall even iterative waterfall (which came later) make responding to change expensive by enabling early commitment. You are twisting words.,2018-03-15T00:30:16.313,1293
10567,4469,0,I can agree to disagree - as you pointed out this side discussion is really out of scope for this question.,2018-03-15T00:35:20.120,1537
10568,4468,2,_@JudyOakley The core issue with (school) group projects that everyone overlooks is that you will _never_ in any other arena face such a broad range of ability levels.  Lone-ranger programmers are often just skilled at what they're doing and would rather not deal with people behind them in knowledge. (After all not everyone is cut out to be a teacher.) These programmers tend to do well in classes then go on to Google/Microsoft/Facebook where they work quite happily in teams with other skilled people.  Further top companies usually have an individual contributor role made [cont'd],2018-03-15T02:47:28.350,664
10569,4468,0,... for highly-skilled programmers who would rather manage their own projects. I understand the desire to encourage teamwork in school but I would strongly suggest allowing people to work independently if they feel that strongly about it.  Or if absolutely required let people choose their teammates and the problem will sort itself out.,2018-03-15T02:47:33.330,664
10570,4426,0,_@immibis 2^10 == 1024. 1024/2 is what? And what is the size of a sector (though it's not a requirement)? 512 is what? 2^9. Nothing I suggested is amiss.,2018-03-15T02:47:56.540,4650
10571,4470,0,As a computer science student I have no interest in sinking countless hours into a lab class (which at my university are usually worth 1-2 credits despite always having a heavy workload). Should I be put into a class like this I would do my best to sandbag and fake incompetence so that I don't get put on such a dream team and get a C- in the class for not exceeding expectations enough.,2018-03-15T03:55:01.787,4655
10572,4468,0,I'd like to point out that current thought among the companies that are hiring the superstars is that people who can code are a dime a dozen and what they really need are people that can both understand the code _and communicate it_. Forcing high-fliers into group interaction is not crippling them (they will have plenty of other opportunities to expand their coding) it is an attempt to teach something they badly badly need to learn.,2018-03-15T03:59:52.537,4656
10573,4476,0,You can also have a project planning session where the students themselves are given the chance to assign their own roles.

10574,4473,3,Get the high performer writing automated tests. - or other tooling. Writing tooling that saves time for other contributors is a nice skill to have it suits lone rangers well (since the tooling is often smaller in scope and suitable for a single person) and naturally forces personal interaction - their peers have now become their _clients_.,2018-03-15T04:09:22.303,4656
10575,4427,0,Early or late returns or both.  Mid-block returns and returns from loops and nested if statements are smells and why they should be avoided can be explained in easy terms of hiding the intent (loops should terminate when items are found deeply nested conditions should be made early checks or the mainline logic),2018-03-15T05:42:43.977,4657
10576,4464,2,Working in a team does not necessarily mean working as close together as when team programming. Somebody who likes to work on his own for some reason (and CS people will often need to work alone later) can do so and still be a productive member of the team just by contributing parts which can be done solo. There are different personality types and different learning types and both have categories for lone rangers. It is no good idea to force them too much to work in a way which is less efficient for them if it is not absolutely needed.,2018-03-15T10:02:39.597,4631

10584,4482,2,I have occasionally lied to students about some technical detail but always immediately in the next sentence tell them I lied so that they can note it and follow up when the truth is available. But you have to warn them ethically. Misconceptions can be hard to erase and the follow up might be missed for one reason or another. So if you lie do it _honestly_.

10586,4465,0,_@Erik I wasn't offended just a bit surprised that someone who didn't know me at all would say that. I was going to let it slide but now that you have addressed me directly here I am. For one thing I teach high school not university. My students are usually 15-year-old boys who still need a lot of guidance. I'm sure you can relate.

10587,4465,0,_@Erik what I wrote about monitoring the students to avoid LR syndrome was for 90% of them who NEEDED that sort of supervision. Yes they had gone rogue in a previous semester but they wrote CRAPPY code! That was why they needed the team! The other 10% were indeed stars so I left them alone and voila a couple of Dream Teams emerged who did amazing and wonderful things.  My original question was not intended to look for ways to squelch superstars but how to manage those who don't need to go rogue just yet for various reasons.  I think if you re-read it you will see that.,2018-03-15T13:53:53.697,4338

10591,4468,0,_@Walfrat Yes companies would like a perfect employee; that's not my point.

10600,4485,0,?€?For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear simple and wrong.?€? -- H.L. Mencken.  There are too many Java tyros out there---some of them writing real-world commercial code---who do not understand the difference between an instance and a variable.

10609,4496,0,Good. It will also let them see that destructors are not only for memory management. But don't the file-stream objects of the STL close the file automatically when they go out of scope?,2018-03-16T12:33:14.717,1873
10610,4497,0,Is it common to call destructors directly in C++?,2018-03-16T12:35:54.577,1873
10611,4495,0,This idea sounds very interesting and fun. I am trying to work out the details.,2018-03-16T12:38:55.707,1873
10612,4496,0,Yes if you use such an object since it has its own destructor. But you can open files otherwise. Any resource held should be released in a destructor if it can't be immediately released. See: http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/8-7-destructors/. So your problem (illustrating...) gets harder if everything you use is already properly built. Actually you can allocate anything for any purpose. Release it in the destructor. Oh. And don't call any destructor twice (implicitly or otherwise). Very bad bug.,2018-03-16T12:39:03.180,1293
10613,4497,0,_@ErelSegal-Halevi You've got me I could be barking up the wrong tree. I'm a Java guy.  I assumed that they were C++'s way to deallocate objects and that they had to be called just like constructors.  Upon examining the question now it seems like I was mistaken about that part.  However [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16720201/calling-destructor-explicitly) appears to be an interesting case when a destructor should be manually called.  However it might be out of scope of your course.,2018-03-16T12:39:54.393,27
10614,4495,0,hmm... on second thought I think this requires explicit deletion by the programmer rather than a destructor in the clas..,2018-03-16T13:10:37.553,1873
10616,4496,0,_@Buffy What OS does not write until close? I know that the file is not **guaranteed** written until you call flush or close. 2nd setting a pointer to null in C++ **WILL NOT** call the destructor; you have to use `delete`. It is not a garbage collected language. Unless you use smart pointers with the appropriate code.,2018-03-16T13:20:33.677,204

10619,4496,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I was just describing how to make the object go out of scope nothing more. I understand that setting to null doesn't invoke the destructor. I don't understand the most recent comment.,2018-03-16T13:26:29.590,1293
10620,4488,0,_@CAD you dredged up some bad memories there because when I graduated and went to work my weakest skills were in revision control unit testing and batch file syntax (DOS). Revision control we didn't even use our builds weren't long enough to need batch files and unit testing was something usually skipped in the heat of getting it working.  I was mortified to learn that I didn't know so much!  And remembering those feelings of being let down by my instructors - why didn't they tell me? - inspires me to make sure I incorporate these things - or at least mention them - in my coursework.,2018-03-16T14:00:19.467,4338
10621,4497,0,Normally the delete operator on a pointer invokes the destructor. It is rare (very) that destructors are invoked directly.,2018-03-16T14:03:28.070,1293
10622,4501,0,Thanks for your answer. In my class students take notes by hand and the most important ideas are listed in the outline I give at the beginning of the class. I like the idea of the collaborative writing of notes that I read as publishing a study guide is indeed useless.,2018-03-16T17:59:36.010,2877
10623,4499,0,Thanks for your answer. My tests are indeed designed to help my students learn and I know their importance. Re-phrasing my syllabus by pre-fixing every item on a list by Make sure you understand ... doesn't seem like a useful document to me and it prevents my students to learn how to actually do that by themselves. The abundance of homeworks (that looks *like* what they will have at the exam) and the fact that I highlight the core ideas repeatedly to me makes that your answer suggest that study guide aren't so useful in this context.,2018-03-16T18:03:58.347,2877
10624,4499,2,_@Cl??ment That was information that I didn't have when I wrote the answer.  Letting them know that the test questions will strongly resemble the homework questions could indeed serve the same purpose.  In effect you've already created a detailed study guide for the students. You just need to call their attention to it.,2018-03-16T18:22:47.953,27
10625,4501,0,This sort of study guide helps with learning but helps less with the reduction of student anxiety (unless the teacher carefully reads and blesses the study guide that the students produce.),2018-03-16T18:25:07.150,27

10628,4495,2,Releasing the memory occupied by a `Foobar` instance is not the responsibility of the class's destructor.  The destructor gets called _before_ the memory is released.  It's responsibility is to release _other_ resources---to free other objects to close open files etc.---that were owned by the `Foobar` object.,2018-03-16T18:39:12.780,1269
10629,4503,0,No worries this is a great question. And I'm very interested to see the answers because I've struggled with the same thing.,2018-03-16T18:43:24.053,27
10631,4496,0,Reword of my most resent comment as @Buffy pointed out that it dose note make sense: If STL does all the file stuff then how about a class that uses `malloc` or `new` in the constructor you will need `free` or `delete` in the destructor.,2018-03-16T19:26:40.580,204
10632,4497,0,_@Buffy but you suggest that going out of scope causes the destructor to be called and that setting pointer to null causes it to go out of scope. Only calling delete or being automatic (stack semantics) and going out of scope will cause destructor to run (and object to be freed).,2018-03-16T19:30:28.787,204
10633,4487,0,Conceptually. However what you want the student to grasp is the connection between sight and math as similar to brain and braille. It?€?s not that much different. You want the student to *think* how to get it done and what one needs to know/learn for that to happen. Appealing to that knowledge center fosters learning a lot better IMHO.,2018-03-16T20:10:52.073,4677
10635,4506,1,That is a great point @CT that some students if given a study guide will study only the study guide!  But isn't that better than if they didn't study at all?  And it's interesting to hear you say you thought in-class reviews were helpful.  I know some people feel very differently.  Another question perhaps?,2018-03-17T00:17:43.777,4338

10640,4431,1,Moreover teach that the 1 kB = 1000 B and 1 KiB = 1024 B is the _official standard_ (by ISO etc.) for the usage of these prefixes but there still exist a lot of _non-standard_ usages in relation to kB (usually given as KB) especially in older products and legacy systems. And if ambiguity can be a problem to say that one should either specify that kB = 1000 B or to stick with KiB ( = 1024 B) (and the higher MiB GiB etc.) exclusively as that one is unambiguous even if not a nice decimal factor (though you SHOULD know your powers of 2! :) ).,2018-03-17T08:47:13.100,4693
10641,4431,2,But in the interests of getting standards used and adopted _firmly discourage_ them from _using_ kB/KB _themselves_ to mean 1024 B _even if others are doing so_. They should _only_ know this usage for _understanding others' work_ NOT for using it in their own! The way to break the habit is to get the next generation doing the right thing so they replace the old dogs and push bad practices into the history bin where they belong.,2018-03-17T08:48:40.130,4693
10642,4448,0,Consider that in most programming languages this formal definition of set is not what is implemented.

11647,4431,0,_@JimmyB My point is that the megabyte used in the description 1.44 megabyte floppy disk is neither power-of-ten nor power-of-two but a combination of both.

11657,4494,0,_@ErelSegal-Halevi  I mean trees graphs etc. are merely containers for data and can be built from basic containers from the standard library.

11658,4505,0,I'm not discussing code dumps.  I'm discussing giving the students one possible answer to the exercise I've given them.  While I appreciate all the effort you put in to preparing your answer you've sort of misread my question.,2018-03-19T12:38:01.770,4689
11662,4516,0,Glad to see you follow what I'm asking @Buffy.  I was beginning to despair of anyone understanding exactly how different FP is from the imperative OO C Family languages that dominate these days.,2018-03-19T13:36:05.167,4689
11664,4517,0,Is there any reason why grading by percentages cannot just as easily implement the concept of rework?,2018-03-19T13:45:05.340,4082
11665,4513,0,Can you further describe percentage grading? From your description there seems to be a similar impact to assignment skipping in either case. Even when using percentage grading it would appear that assignment scores are still cumulative in the sense that they are added together. It appears that the only real difference between the two methods is that the weighting applied is by the point total of the assignment not some external applied weight.,2018-03-19T13:52:43.790,4082
11666,4517,0,_@GorchestopherH I would say rework is easier with points because students can more readily see how it will affect their grade and be more likely to engage in it and there's not as much calculation required on the teacher's part.,2018-03-19T13:53:21.753,4338
11667,4518,2,While you have some great material in here and this is absolutely applicable to the realm in which I operate this really doesn't apply too well to the question being asked.,2018-03-19T14:34:59.770,4082
11668,4513,0,_@GorchestopherH: Usually with percentage grading a student gets a 0 for not doing an assignment and the effect of this might be less predictable. Possibly not of course depending on other factors but predictability is a good thing for students IMO.,2018-03-19T14:37:15.640,1293
11669,4513,0,If the assignment component of your course represents 800 total points and you have an assignment worth 100 of those points. You forfeit 100 points of 800 or 12.5% of your assignment grade. How is this significantly different than getting 0 on one of 8 assignments each worth 12.5% of your assignment grade? It's possible that I just don't have a good definition of what makes these methods distinct every grading system I've experienced has been some kind of hybrid.,2018-03-19T15:31:35.623,4082

11671,4505,0,_@OnorioCatenacci And I believe you've misread my answer. By code dump I simply mean handing them a code solution without any explanation. The point I'm making in this answer is that the code is the least important part. The most important part is outlining **the process** of coming up with an answer in the first place.,2018-03-19T16:12:15.587,2068
11672,4517,0,I suppose the trade-off here is that you put the work in up-front to ensure that the merit system for an individual assignment directly fits into the merit system for the course in general which saves your students from having to do any calculating to figure out where they stand.,2018-03-19T16:25:31.030,4082
11673,4517,0,Yes and that up-front work can evolve over several semesters.  But the students love it.,2018-03-19T18:51:17.403,4338

11676,4519,0,Why do you say Windows Forms and ASP.NET are essentially the same thing? Windows Forms as far as I'm aware uses all explicitl code to manage UI elements. ASP.NET leverages templating engines to generate HTML pages. ASP.NET has also grown to include MVC Razor and Web API and I believe they are more common than raw ASP.NET now. The inclusion of communicating via web requests also necessitates a much stricter separation between presentation and logic. I would not call them even nearly the same.,2018-03-20T01:49:17.807,981

11678,4519,0,_@EdmundReed I think you could certainly make an answer out of that. One answer does suggest providing the *entire* presentation layer but your more specific suggestion of providing a CSS stylesheet still allows them to build the presentation layer and neatly solves the OP's specific problem.,2018-03-20T02:31:09.160,981
11679,4524,16,One of the bells and whistles I've learned NEVER to leave out even in supposedly throwaway scripts is *complete usage information* for a command line tool when run with `--help` as an argument.  Actually I usually write that usage message *first* which forces me to design the script to be usable before I start implementing it.  Boy do the sysadmins I work with love me for it.,2018-03-20T05:45:24.983,1103
11680,114,0,_@PeterTaylor I think it varies here the first round is just sending in solutions and it is open for a few months. Then there is a second round (best 100 of first round) which is 3 hours under exam conditions and a third round (best 10 of second round) which is also 3  or 4 hours under exam conditions. In addition to that there is some training for the final round. I think your first round is comparable to our second round.,2018-03-20T07:16:52.857,111
11682,4519,33,so I am at a loss as to why all of this is so interesting to the students. I can answer this. There is immediate gratification when you change the styling. Change 1 line refresh the page immediate results. It's easy to work by always changing small things and see the page evolve constantly from absolutely crap to something that actually looks good. Now compare this to writing a procedure to insert a record in a database. You can't easily split this in tiny chunks you can test separately. so they have to work more before getting results.,2018-03-20T08:21:10.267,4722
11683,4519,15,If you are just trying to teach core programming concepts and don't want students to be distracted by a GUI which you yourself avoided by learning in command line programming have you tried teaching them in command line programming? The GUI can come when they need to learn about the GUI.,2018-03-20T09:03:15.770,1853
11684,4525,1,Actually not. There are fixed due dates even when re-work is allowed. One rule might be that if you don't meet the deadline you don't get to do re-work. Variations are possible such as a minimum score on the first version. Without re-work however deadlines can be as firm as in any other system. The scheme doesn't have to make it hard on the instructor and there are techniques for easing the pain on marking re-work. For example the old work is turned in with the new and all in a folder. You can have students mark changes between versions.,2018-03-20T10:39:12.737,1293
11685,4519,6,The look and feel of things is an essential part of human interaction and engagement. This is as true for your teaching practice as it is for the end result of any assignment. While it may not be within the scope of your course to teach this I still think it's important that students understand how the css feed into the code - and how the manipulation of one can impact the behaviour of the other.,2018-03-20T12:11:03.410,4067
11688,4525,0,If there are fixed due dates for both and rework is allowed for both then there really is no difference beyond perception,2018-03-20T13:23:26.773,4417
11689,4519,6,As others have said it's easier and more gratifying to create visual changes than writing code that works in the background this doesn't apply to only students either. If you've ever been a developer for a company that needs to appease shareholders you'll know what it's like to spend months rewriting an entire site architecture to increase maintainability and reuse and receive little praise but then reskin a few buttons on the homepage and you've saved the day.,2018-03-20T13:24:18.787,4723
11691,4530,0,Well in my case in particular I'm teaching professional developers who already know C#; I'm attempting to teach them Scheme.  So it's not quite as dire as trying to teach people who've never coded two languages at the same time. :),2018-03-20T14:15:21.590,4689
11692,4529,0,A colleague (and member here) reminds me offline that student's should't put solutions to their labs in their portfolio. Maybe he will expand that to a full answer. If it is permitted then labs can't really be reused from year to year which is truly a complication for both the professor and the student. If not allowed it cuts down on the projects available for inclusion but the prose is the most important thing anyway I think.,2018-03-20T14:35:56.500,1293
11693,4531,0,While I generally agree the issue really only becomes a _problem_  when students neglect what they are meant to do rather than when they want to go beyond the requirements. Of course spending too much time on ephemera is a problem in its own right.,2018-03-20T14:39:13.887,1293
11694,4531,1,_@Buffy Hence Perhaps enforce this by making students show you their work when they are finished so that you can give them permission to start adding extra functionality.. If they have to prove that they have done what they are supposed to before they are allowed to work on other things then it's harder for them to neglect things. Naturally the viability of this varies with the environment (i.e. it's easier with pre-college/pre-uni environments). The time taken to check students' work would have to be factored into lesson time as well.,2018-03-20T14:45:52.990,1538

11711,4535,0,Welcome to CSEducators and thanks for your post. I think that illustrating by starting with a Scheme program and showing it in some other language is probably the best path for this sort of thing rather than the opposite. That way the new language has cleaner code and if the translation is messy it can illustrate the power of the new paradigm. Showing messy Scheme would be counterproductive.,2018-03-20T19:34:23.967,1293

11755,4519,1,?€?I am at a loss as to why all of this is so interesting to the students?€? Someone answered regarding immediate satisfaction I will answer this concern about work and business purposes. Most of the software I develop for my clients is graphical (e.g. Android or iOS apps). Every time I see GUIs by other people who do not care about UI guidelines consistently sized icons margins or fonts it drives me insane. It's painful to use a GUI where things are not aligned properly. **Customers notice end users notice as well.** They will consider your work better because it works *and looks* right.,2018-03-22T17:54:12.817,963

During the *designing* phase polishing each and every page is a colossal loss of time as most will be scraped anyway. The underlying issue I think is that thinking about the functionality requires building up an abstract model which takes more effort especially for non-technical people so they focus on the immediate. A tick can be making the pages looking *obviously* like drafts with squiggly borders and a post-it theme to make it obvious it's a throw-away interface.,2018-03-22T18:15:13.513,1848
11760,4533,0,_@Pharap #1 the question has nothing to do with an ethical response the OP asked for motivational techniques. #2  you are making an assumption as to how that class is graded. it's only unethical if the class only bases grades on performance and not on participation as well.

11761,4523,2,_@MatthieuM. I see.

11766,4547,0,In my experience perfect is more often than not the enemy of good enough.  There seems to be a consensus that software is good if the answers to both of the following are yes. 1. Did you build the thing right? 2. Did you build the right thing? I think an argument could be made that UI tweaking is in this case not the right thing -- because it's not what the customer wants.,2018-03-23T14:53:12.210,2501
11767,4547,0,However there does seem to be a mismatch between the course goals and the technologies in play.  If the focus is really on core programming concepts the students should probably be writing command-line programs not WinForms and/or Web apps.

11768,4549,1,Note: after the `}` `objectRefernece` will have the same state as at the start of the code. The new object that you created is assigned to a local reference. (In most/all C like languages),2018-03-23T15:15:54.937,204

11771,4549,0,Are you saying that students say uh! because they've figured it out for themselves or because you've stared at them for 20 seconds? I've never heard the term two-alternative selection before- are you just talking about `else` blocks here?,2018-03-23T16:15:45.327,2068
11772,4549,0,TY to @ctrl-alt-delor for pointing out the local variable. I missed it in my original answer but have corrected it.,2018-03-23T16:51:36.780,1293

11774,4533,0,But where does it end? Is briefly staring out the window off-topic? Is going to the toilet off-topic? What if the student has already completed all the work? Should they be banned from tweaking the colours on a finished program? Should they be banned from doing work for another class (since that's definitely off-topic)?,2018-03-23T19:48:05.347,1538
11776,4549,0,testing if is not what an if does. It evaluates a condition then if that's true then it executes some code. (An if-else executes a branch per test result.) Testing if & testing whether *don't even have any clear everyday meanings*. So it is hopeless & ill-considered to refer to them.

11780,4457,0,_@Gorchestopher I disagree; initally presenting a bunch of definitions to students without good context can  make examples hard to reason with.

11785,4551,0,If you remove the local declaration then you have a once pattern. A once method only does something the first time it is called. Often used to create an `init` method (for late initialisation) the init method is called at the top of every method. It is responsible for doing it once. I struggle to see a use case for a local shadow variable.,2018-03-24T09:30:43.900,204
11786,4551,1,I think it is really just a case of poor coding. It looks like the poster missed something. It is certainly a poor example for teaching the `if` structure to a novice.,2018-03-24T09:39:45.937,1293

11793,4553,0,Welcome to CSEducators. You seem to have had a terrible educational experience. I'm sorry that happened. It should not have happened. There _are_ educators who try to assure that it doesn't happen but it seems we failed you. I think we need to hear more from you.,2018-03-25T09:51:23.247,1293
11794,4547,0,ItamarG3 : Thank you for the feedback and the welcome. I hope so too. @David : I disagree with the argument that UI teaking is not what the customer wants but I'll admit there's a possibility.  On the other hand I agree with your second comment. And combining your two possibilities it's also probable that the course could have been poorly designed DUE to instructor bias. Maybe prior hands-on experience with .NET programming has the OP resort to relying on WinForms/ASP to teach fundamentals instead of other languages.,2018-03-26T06:51:06.370,2854
11795,4547,0,On a different note I do not see why programming basics are being taught with such high level framework-based languages. If the course is about the languages themselves then shouldn't there already be a CS 1001 course (I mean a basic one) where students are taught these fundamentals? If that responsibility also lies with the OP then maybe we can start off with some <insert basic language here> programming in the first few weeks of the course before moving on to ASP .NET.,2018-03-26T06:54:25.050,2854

11810,4557,1,What in the world did your roommate do that was so inefficient?  I am having trouble imagining.,2018-03-26T22:35:37.127,27
11813,4515,0,There is one true language and it is mathematics. You cannot even precisely & clearly explain what any of the programs in any of the languages do without giving a rule to translate a program into math. That math of the semantics is the simplest possible way to explain what any program is doing. (The primary notion is of a mapping.) It is only sadly because languages & programming are taught [sic] *without* explicit semantics that reminscent variations in other languages are even sought for clarification. Forget analogies explain what is actually going on.,2018-03-27T02:42:47.727,2485
11814,1183,0,I think nearly anyone can learn at least a bit of programming.  This question isn't asking how to turn every student into someone who could be a career programmer.  I agree that's clearly impossible.  You have to like the logic of thinking like a computer to do it successfully and for the long term.  I agree it's a mistake to think that everyone could be a coder or even some any IT position.,2018-03-27T03:45:50.783,1654
11815,1183,0,I *think* almost everyone could eventually learn something about the most simple of programming even if it didn't really sink in or fit with how they think.  The question for me is whether that's compatible with teaching other students who get it an interesting amount of material in the same class.  Maybe yes if you set your learned *something* threshold low enough for the students who don't get it quickly or easily.,2018-03-27T03:48:14.620,1654
11817,4558,0,_@NomadMaker: If the teleport takes longer putting on shoes is off the critical path; you can do it while the teleport warms up and still have time to program the destination.  So the teleport time to arrive properly shod is `max(teleport_warmup  shoes)`.,2018-03-27T04:09:40.510,1654
11818,4558,0,_@Richard: do you find this example leaves students confused when they *don't* have the exact function just a complexity class?  Do they end up thinking they always need to know the constants before they can drop them or something?  Hopefully that isn't a problem but worth asking.  (I'm not a CS teacher other than on SO but answering SO questions exposes me to a firehose of questions from people who failed to understand stuff I thought was obvious... as well as the rarer interesting questions about tricky stuff.),2018-03-27T04:14:16.613,1654
11819,4557,0,_@BenI. It's a singly-linked list *going from MSB to LSB*.  Carry propagates in the other direction!!  Presumably there were getter / setter functions that took an integer digit position and traversed the list each time for each access to each digit in an extended-precision multiply!  So element access is O(n) and a slow O(n) at that.,2018-03-27T04:19:02.770,1654
11820,4557,0,If indexing is from the LSB it might walk the list once to get length then walk it again to reach the right element.  That's only increasing the constant factor so the whole linked-list storage scheme only raises the complexity class by a factor of `n` but what a huge constant factor.  Pointer chasing has latency that out-of-order execution can't hide easily vs. array indexing with non-data-dependent offsets.,2018-03-27T04:27:36.293,1654
11822,4554,4,Just a heads-up. Be prepared for ridiculous amounts of giggling at the phrase Big O.,2018-03-27T08:52:58.253,4751
11829,4560,0,While drawing asymptotic behaviour is fine you should be careful to include that making an asymptotic claim from a drawing is a dangerous exercise that shouldn't be attempted unless the student knows what that means!,2018-03-27T13:00:55.127,154
11831,4557,1,FWIW here's the alg my roommate came up with: Loop a counter from 1 to the length of the first number (n). For each value start at the beginning and iterate to the correct spot in the linked list (n*n).  Do a second interior loop for the second number (n^3) and then iterate to the correct spot in the linked list (n^4).  Finally iterate to the correct spot to put the information in the answer's linked list (n^5).  The reason it was so inefficient is because he didn't walk to the next node in those linked lists - he started over at the beginning each time.  Which Big-O helps analyze awesomely,2018-03-27T13:21:26.883,4777
11843,4558,0,I wonder if it would be helpful to graph the ratio of the actual time or resource requirement to the big-O function.  While working with quotients analytically is apt to be rather troublesome if f(x) is O(g(x)) and f(x) and g(x) are positive everywhere then it will possible to identify an x0 and y0 such that the graph never enters the region where x>x0 and f(x)/g(x)>y0.,2018-03-27T16:15:55.863,2073
11844,4554,1,To my great relief @AJFaraday there was no giggling when I used the term in the classroom.  Maybe they are still too naive.  Small gifts.,2018-03-27T16:57:19.403,4338
11845,4559,1,Funny you should mention this.  A student came to me yesterday during lunch and did the very same analysis on the board to make sure she understood the concept.,2018-03-27T16:59:45.973,4338
11846,4559,0,_@JavaJive This is so simple that everyone can think of it. That alone already makes it useful for teaching IMO.,2018-03-27T17:10:10.567,154
11847,4563,0,Not imploring. The reason for registering is that you (a) get to edit your posts for clarification and (b) avoid others editing them beyond your recognition. Also you could consider it to be a curtesy to those who want to assist you. You can still be anonymous as I am.

11849,4565,2,I think your tl;dr focuses on the wrong part. The OP's root problem is that the test-takers don't appropriately budget their time. It's true that open book tests have an additional component that needs to be budgeted for but people can fall victim to poor time management even in closed-book exams.,2018-03-27T17:59:21.963,1703
11850,4565,1,_@NuclearWang Open book just exacerbates the problem though. Every minute page turning is a minute _not_ spent thinking. Without the crutch of the book you have a better shot at a more comprehensive solution - namely _active learning_,2018-03-27T18:03:06.463,1293
11851,4515,0,I think you're very much in danger of wandering into the realm of the sesquipedalian. Saying that mathematics is the one true language may be true (if a tad reductive) but it's hardly helpful.

11853,4564,1,A test where they run out of time is essentially invalid and does not help me. On the contrary. This can certainly be informative of the level of learning of your students. I would ask you to consider who/what your tests are for. When I hear right from the start lots of page-flipping I know it will not end well. Then why not intervene right then? Why persist knowing that it will not end well? How have you reacted in those moments? I fear this is another case of an anonymous question that would benefit for OP's improving thereof but will never receive it...,2018-03-27T21:31:06.243,76
11854,4555,0,Related: [Bubble Sort: An Archaeological Algorithmic Analysis](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/papers/bubble.pdf) is an interesting read about the origins of the algo and it's popularity as a teaching example.,2018-03-27T22:41:31.940,1654
11855,4457,0,_@Soupy Not presenting the rules leads to blind memorization. Sure it *feels* warm and cozy to say you teach by examples and hands on etc. but for many basic concepts and definitions you really do need to know the rules. Expecting students to infer what a set or a constructor is with only examples is more of a riddle than a teaching style.,2018-03-28T01:11:05.027,4082
11856,4515,0,I used relevant technical & everyday terms appropriately. You say you want to teach effectively. Then you could google based on my comment.,2018-03-28T02:27:03.223,2485
11857,4506,1,_@JavaJive that's a good point and I'm not sure if the answer.  IME other students complain about classes not being hard enough -> they were not forced to study -> didn't retain course material -> upset because now they need to know the course material for either a subsequent class or an interview.  My opinion is in CS especially students must learn to find answers and form their own study plan.  Study guides etc train them to expect a study guide get the grade move on without giving much thought on learning how to learn themselves.,2018-03-28T05:16:22.870,4467
11859,4560,0,In the table of results I would add a sample how the time grow for each complexity. For instance base the fact that at n=100 O(n) take 1s and show us the time that it represent people will understand that much better.,2018-03-28T12:02:48.570,1375
11860,130,0,Introduce them to the Obfuscated C contest and ask them to debug the programs.  Since editors will fix indentation now show them Ctrl + Shift + F. Unless you're doing python it's something that programmers don't worry about they let the editor do it for them. My son (7 years old) has just started learning Java and once he discovered the magic key strokes in Eclipse all was good,2018-03-29T01:52:22.480,1537
11861,4567,1,I'm sorry but I think you are trying to put it all on the students rather than taking responsibility for teaching them properly. _Sink or Swim_ is a pretty brutal teaching philosophy. Admonishing them to Be Professional is about as valuable in itself as Be Moral. You shouldn't be mystified. You should find ways to learn about your students just as they should learn about the material. Memorization in particular may be (at least a bit) less important than you think. I program at a high level but Google is my co-pilot for example. Pressure is a mind killer for some. Try to avoid it.,2018-03-29T14:37:15.880,1293
11863,145,0,I really like the idea of having them trace messy code. Might have to try that next year.,2018-03-29T17:35:10.920,30
11864,4564,0,Not sure if this is deserving of a full answer but have you thought about rearranging your questions in order of difficulty? That is put the questions you think will be easiest first and the ones you think will be hardest last. This would help the students who panic and forget about test taking strategy while having no real impact on the other students.,2018-03-30T02:34:16.333,732

11870,4565,1,_@StackTracer it is possible of course to create exam questions in which the book is essentially irrelevant but don't discount the _perverse incentive_ that open book exams may create for the student's study/learning process.

11888,2875,0,I read an article that said it had to do with teaching capacity and the need professors felt to make the field more competitive.

11894,4570,1,There's often a confusion between learning comp. programming and learning the low level elements of a computer.  Actually it more about learning to analyze what you want and figure how to have the bloody thing doing it with providing a description in whatever language you have.,2018-04-02T17:43:28.573,2103
11896,4481,1,I'd like to point out that many of these objections can be fixed with a text editor/IDE that closely integrates with an interactive environment. For example Emacs allows you to evaluate code directly in the text file you are editing using a variety of languages. These include Python Scheme Clojure Common Lisp Haskell and  many others.,2018-04-02T20:22:09.857,2040

11904,4569,0,As somehow this is the big deterrent to learning lower level languages. I'd like to know who teaching an introductory programming course actually ends up in a place where their students *actually* need to learn memory management?,2018-04-04T21:06:07.887,4082

11912,4582,0,The first day I started programming I was surely a beginner I was 13 I started with C/C++ (I was using iostream string and vector but it was basically C: no classes only structs). Growing up I started appreciating the differences between C and C++ and refining the knowledge of both. I think there is no real need to start with something like ?€?scratch?€? unless someone is really young. Probably the best thing would be to start with scratch at maybe 3-6 and then gradually move to a real programming language. But i have no experience in that only my personal one.,2018-04-06T10:29:33.413,4818
11918,4585,0,This is somewhat related to https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/4410/what-are-the-tradeoffs-of-allowing-students-to-submit-test-corrections though not exactly the same.,2018-04-06T16:38:49.193,1293

11925,4591,0,While I understand the advice given in the first paragraphs I was already aware of this and think that has been one of the problems. This might be a good time to mention that I'm not the one responsible for designing the assignment but a concerned grading assistant. Of course this doesn't make your advice less valuable merely less useful to me in particular. As for 'scaling down' that would be difficult. Deep learning only gives reasonable results on large datasets as far as I'm aware. I do think that perhaps 'scaling _out_' might be possible: circumvent the actual computations somehow.,2018-04-08T15:26:54.243,154
11926,4590,4,The main problem here is of course that the costs may scale badly wrt to the number of students. But this is a good overview of this option thanks.,2018-04-08T15:28:29.470,154
11927,4589,0,Should the question be taken from the perspective of a grading TA? (I ask because you did not mention this in the prompt),2018-04-08T15:31:58.827,27
11928,4589,1,_@BenI. My intention was to ask independent of my personal perspective as 1) I think this may be an issue some course designers could encounter and hence focusing on my perspective is unhelpful for the general public. 2) I'm aware of how I can use information for course designers to provide suggestions to the course designer. Hence I don't think any accommodation to my perspective would help. But good that you mention it.,2018-04-08T15:34:34.077,154
11930,4585,2,_@EllenSpertus It's about as easy to adjust the clock on a personal computer as it is to adjust the alarm clock on the dresser. Timestamps from _other_ controlled hardware is useless and even from school controlled is sometimes questionable.,2018-04-08T17:35:29.650,104
11935,4590,0,Kindly add the FloydHub as well - one of my student used it recently and its not as powerful as AWS but maybe fit somewhere for some assignments.,2018-04-09T01:11:57.467,2537
11937,4591,0,_@Discretelizard Sure deep learning only gives good results on initial training on large datasets. Then the industry found a workaround for that and transfer learning is the main way of making working nets. This is completely doable with standard laptops.,2018-04-09T06:30:22.787,4667
11938,4590,3,_@TalhaIrfan Please don't add every single cloud service to this answer.,2018-04-09T07:48:07.687,4236
11947,4593,1,The idea of using clould computing (and even Azure specifically) is already covered by Aurora0001's answer. For that reason I've downvoted.,2018-04-09T14:38:49.577,58
11948,4589,8,In grad school I destroyed two perfectly fine laptops by running computationally-intensive tasks on them that they weren't capable of handling. Please be respectful to your students: if they're telling you that their computers are overheating there is a very real possibility that some of your students will see their laptops become unusable because of the assignments.,2018-04-09T15:16:40.403,1360
11949,4590,1,I second this approach. As a current graduate student last semester I took a parallel computing class that had all CPU parallelization assignments done (via SSH) on a computing cluster at our university and all GPU parallelization assignments done on a Google Cloud instance using an Nvidia Tesla K80.  The GCloud credits were more than enough to cover usage time during the course.  I think @Aurora0001 has the most appropriate solution.,2018-04-09T15:38:20.650,4856
11950,4597,1,This leaves me with variable naming only for the purpose of clarity. - This is exactly right and the reason programmers are strongly encouraged - when not forced - to follow naming conventions for the language. If you want to give an example to your students show them two snippets of code: one with proper names and the same snippet but with meaningless single-character names. The reasoning will become obvious when they see it.,2018-04-09T15:54:00.233,4858
11951,4597,0,_@Strikegently That sounds like a nice little answer in the making.  You should flesh that out :),2018-04-09T16:04:15.430,27
11953,4596,0,get/set methods may or may not be useful for introducing students to programming but they are an integral part of OO:  They allow an object to encapsulate its properties and provide a consistent contract for them (such as guaranteeing the value is never null).  If getters and setters are doing nothing but reading and writing a private field?€? well they?€?re doing it wrong.,2018-04-09T17:14:21.263,1153
11954,4596,3,_@VGR the consistent contract is actually not dependent externally on knowing that a field exists. A mutator updates the state of the computation somehow not necessarily the state of a variable. Get/Set leads to an improper overly mechanistic view. It forces low-level thinking when OO is about high-level thinking. If a mutator exists for logical reasons and later when you build the class the best implementation is a field then it isn't a problem. The problem arises when you think about objects as bundles of fields rather than bundles of behavior.,2018-04-09T17:18:59.637,1293
11955,4596,0,It's worth noting that the naming conventions for Java are [officially documented](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html). And there is a convention for pluralizing class names: non-instantiable classes that provide static utility methods for producing or manipulating instances of the singular form of the class name.,2018-04-09T17:30:27.723,4437
11956,4599,3,*The names of variables should define the information they contain* - depending on the programming language it could also be the name **and type** in the variable declaration.,2018-04-09T17:37:56.587,660
11958,4597,4,*There is good reason for this; deeply clean and clear code also has very few bugs.* -- Yes but the bugs you _do_ end up with are much harder to root out because they're based on mistaken assumptions and those are incredibly difficult to spot. That doesn't mean it's bad to write clean code; I'm just salty that I spent four hours last night trying to figure out why a function was giving me the wrong result when I passed the parameters in the wrong order.,2018-04-09T18:11:27.983,2655
11960,4597,3,_@NicHartley I dunno. Mismatched params will exist in clean or dirty code and I think it's easier to catch the the mistake in `(firstName lastName middleName)` than `(name name2 result)`. I mean the only reason you even know the second one is out of order is because I just told you.,2018-04-09T18:17:21.440,1578
11968,4594,1,I teach my students their job will not be writing working perfect programs at first shot but trying to understand and fix problems in programs that should work but don't. So using good naming practices from start will help and actually require much less work.,2018-04-09T20:13:54.533,2103

11971,4589,2,_@Vorsprung I was the downvoter because I don't like the idea of offloading the costs to students and because that product could be discontinued. If you undelete it I'd be happy to edit+retract my vote.,2018-04-09T20:31:04.787,58
11974,4596,0,_@VGR get/set for private members is a common practice because the idea is that you don't want to change client code if you change a variable was accessed. Properties somewhat solve this issue but again require you to wrap any of these potential changers in a property to do so.  Funnily enough the only language that managed to get this right(and most everything else wrong) was Matlab. There are only properties in matlab and to change access you can define get and set later at any time eg `get.foo()` and `set.foo()`. This is what all Java style languages should do IE C# and Kotlin.,2018-04-09T20:43:23.457,3168
11975,4588,0,What you are talking about sounds a lot like Competency-Based Education. Is that what you are intending to do?,2018-04-09T22:37:53.027,1931
11977,4589,1,_@Vorsprung for someone who is on the breadline yes \$80 can be an issue. Worst thing could be that those (no matter how few) for whom \$80 is actual money switch to a different course.,2018-04-09T23:10:17.570,757
11979,4588,1,_@RobertColumbia that certainly sounds like what I am describing (after looking up the definition) although I wasn't aware of the term.,2018-04-09T23:16:39.243,4338
11980,4588,0,Two of the principles that often define Competency-Based Education are an ability to resubmit work (or turn in work late) with a (perhaps corresponding) increase in the quality of work required. Instead of allowing students to squeak by with a C- or even lower on a few assignments students are required to get an A (or sometimes an A or a B) on *everything* but have extended opportunities to try and retry to *get* that A or B.,2018-04-09T23:26:23.760,1931
11981,4593,4,Furthermore you shouldn't rely on the students being eligible for a free trial offer since they may have already used it up. Rather you as the instructor should apply for an instructional grant from Microsoft.,2018-04-10T00:24:02.093,897
11982,4601,0,I've downvoted because having patience and being understanding are things which you should be doing anyways. They're relevant to all teaching questions and so this answer isn't specific to this question.,2018-04-10T05:24:00.773,58
11983,4601,0,_@thesecretmaster true it's not a difference of kind so much as degree. I'll try to clarify in my answer that it's going to take on the order of years to learn this so a level of patience is called for *above and beyond what would normally be expected*.,2018-04-10T05:44:11.743,3898
11984,4594,1,Make them code something forget it for 6 months and then alter it to add new functionnalities. After 6 months even your code is not yours anymore. Add to the mix a bit of unit mixing (milliseconds / seconds / meter etc) and they'll understand that coding clearly is mandatory for any code that will stay around.,2018-04-10T07:39:10.690,4871

11987,4597,1,_@Angew I've made that argument to students but I haven't found that it has much traction. The kids are still writing labs that will essentially be read only once and they have a tough time imagining the costs of poorly written code in a large code base over time.,2018-04-10T10:37:01.193,27
11988,4589,0,_@immibis I think the laptops are fine. If the laptops would actually be damaged the students would have mentioned it explicitly. And in any case the students would let IT know if there are problems with the laptops.,2018-04-10T10:45:39.283,154

11990,4594,1,You could but i find it of greater value that you do not understand your own code 6 months later when you wrote it you understood it perfectly and you found it was understandable enough at that time. With code from someone else you could always argue that you wouldn't have written it the way it was and that your way would have been better.,2018-04-10T11:42:35.083,4871

11993,4579,0,Not all lists or arrays are large enough to require heap usage. For the purpose of a beginners course you can certainly as an instructor ensure your students don't have to bother with this.,2018-04-10T13:46:18.580,4082
11994,4604,1,Hi Wes! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is a great first answer and I hope to see you around the site more :),2018-04-10T14:19:45.633,58
11996,4597,1,They're two things that make me struggling with naming : my english including knowledge of the specific field (functional or technical) and  my overall design. Because naming one method is generally easy however naming all classes correctly need that the design is good and that is not easy. If you design approprietly before hand naming because way easier.,2018-04-10T14:58:22.737,1375
11997,4596,1,I find point 6 a bit too strong and accept/write abbreviations if they are well known either in the problem or solution space. I really prefer `HttpProxy` over `HyperTextTransportProtocolProxy`. ???,2018-04-10T15:09:58.843,847
11998,4596,2,I know this might be a bit controversial but the idiom of using `i` as a loop counter has been around so long and used so widely I think it's a bad idea to try to teach people not to use it.  It's something the students will see in practice and if it isn't 'normal' to them it will be harder to grok real production code.  This form is the exception for loops now in Java; I it's not worth the trouble to try to change this.  The loop counter becomes invisible if you follow the idiom and abnormal for loops are apparent.  It's like the sign of an electron (negative): it's too late to change now.,2018-04-10T16:18:29.753,2087
12000,4596,0,_@TKK and others. The referenced document is very old (1999) unmaintained and probably obsolete. Note that the libraries from Oracle don't follow many of those suggestions. In particular not all methods have verb (phrase) names.,2018-04-10T20:25:58.947,1293
12001,4596,0,_@Buffy As a professional Java developer I can attest that it remains relevant. It's incomplete (for example the plural class names I mentioned) but still a very good starting point.,2018-04-10T20:32:26.597,4437
12002,4606,0,The reason for this is that ultimately I want to teach them to be OO programmers and when they get a new problem I want them to think in a thoroughly OO way - isn't FRP the hot new paradigm nowadays?,2018-04-10T23:40:42.080,1275
12003,4596,0,_@JimmyJames The `i` idiom _has_ been around a long time and I have programmed where it was essentially mandatory. Ever since moving to a language that allowed names longer than one character however I have avoided that idiom for the threadbare tradition that it is. I don't even use single character names in one-off loops I type at the command line. If an anonymous short indexer is needed at least use `lcv` for _loop control variable_.,2018-04-11T00:08:21.163,104
12004,4604,0,I _really_ like the third set. It's truly amazing how soon one can forget what they just did once they've had to refocus on something else. Sure beats waiting 6 months for their thinking to get lost and the names to become important.,2018-04-11T00:18:22.777,104
12007,4611,0,Hi Frax! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This is an interesting answer that I certainly wouldn't have thought of myself. I hope to see you around the site :),2018-04-11T01:07:41.257,58
12014,4594,0,Give them an example of code with horrible names and go over the process of improving the names. Maybe even do other refactoring like moving code into new functions and give that function a good name. Allow your students to propose names for everything.,2018-04-11T07:48:42.937,3745
12016,4613,0,On why you may have been voted down (you seem to have been voted down why I think this is): This question seems more about training than education. Computer science is about enduring principles not fad of the month and products. Though every fad will contain many enduring principles (for they are enduring).,2018-04-11T08:05:13.963,204
12017,4605,6,Some of it is teaching order: Do `foreach` before generalised `for`. Foreach is easier and will be used 80% of the time in there future programs so teach it first. Same for container classes. This is related to should I start high or low. Well start as you mean to go on. Students will value and use what they learn first.,2018-04-11T08:11:30.053,204
12018,4594,0,The first homework should be to review [_the_ guide to unmaintainable code on this matter](http://mindprod.com/jgloss/unmainnaming.html) ;),2018-04-11T08:15:23.663,4892
12019,4596,0,get/set is wrong in many ways but is common practice (but still wrong). Some covered here. The first has been mentioned it makes you view an object as a data structure. Next if you have a get it should be a noun phrase so not `getHeight` but `height`. 3rd to many setters will make it impossible to create simple or effective concurrent code (You would need a lot of potentially buggy lock code and the running code will spend most of its time waiting on these locks). Concurrent programming is easy when data is immutable.,2018-04-11T08:31:54.197,204
12021,812,0,in high school ? For people that aren't sure to be working professionally in IT later on I do fail to see any advantage. As a dev I obvisouly value this tools but outside of my job I never use a command line tool as I have no specific usage for it (except for ping when my internet doesn't seem answering ...).,2018-04-11T12:05:46.930,1375
12022,4594,0,Related : [Coding Without Comments](https://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/).  Good naming conventions mean the code should generally read clearly without using comments.  Suggest to students that they do their best to adjust their naming conventions to eliminate the need for comments as much as possible.,2018-04-11T12:22:50.640,2976
12023,4596,2,_@GypsySpellweaver I've honestly never really understood why people have a problem with using `i` this way.  Do people look at the for loop and wonder what the `i` variable is about?  Frankly when people use something else I find it distracting.  In Java the `:` (in) syntax should be preferred anyway.,2018-04-11T13:39:39.797,2087
12024,4606,0,**This!**  Why is the OP teaching bounded *for* before *foreach*?,2018-04-11T13:43:29.347,4896
12025,4596,1,_@GypsySpellweaver With `lcv` you create worse code than with `i` because every reader except you will wonder what `lcv` means.  `i` `j` `k` as index variable names are around even longer because they are often used in formulas/mathematics. Even before any programming languages/computers. So that's a quite strong idiom.,2018-04-11T14:02:48.267,847
12026,4599,0,_@Bergi Given that we are talking about Java which is strongly typed I strongly disagree that you should include the type of the data in the name. I've frequently seen identifiers like 'studentList' because the data structure happens to be a list Even if a Collection is all that is required. When the code is refactored to make the variable another type of Collection maybe a Set the variable is never renamed. That said **Units** if not guaranteed by the data type should be part of the variable name e.g. 'timeInSeconds',2018-04-11T15:50:57.623,4110
12027,4599,0,_@Stormcloud No need to disagree with me I never said you should include the type in the name :-) I meant that the combination of name and type should define the information the variable contains so you can keep the type separate from the name. It's irrelevant whether the language is strongly typed or not it depends on the variable declaration syntax or how easy you can infer the type in the given context. `List students = something;` `var studentList = something;` and `var students = List(something);` would all be fine.,2018-04-11T16:02:10.223,660
12031,4610,1,Time pressure probably helps even more than peer pressure. ;),2018-04-11T23:32:42.093,981
12032,4613,0,The intent is for course development or really course improvement since I have taught the class a few times. Given I teach professional just theory doesn?€?t meet their needs. That said I can see the point of responses being ephemeral.,2018-04-12T00:25:04.160,4886
12033,4596,1,Speaking as someone who writes code for a living in multiple languages it is very important to write code that is idomatic to the language because every other user of that language is doing likewise.  This means in Java you have getters and setters - by the way these refer to properties of the class - they need not refer to the fields in the class.  Teaching `foo()` as the accessor for the `foo` property over `getFoo()` will handicap those students who go on to code commercially.,2018-04-12T08:17:47.337,4899
12034,4605,0,Have something with a good reason to use more advanced constructs. With respect to premature optimization it may actually be a reasonable idea to use a few variables instead of an array so your current premise may be wrong. Not every neat data structure must be used and people have different programming styles. To teach them to use an array show them a task which cannot be (reasonably) solved by introducing more and more variables.,2018-04-12T08:56:08.323,4631
12035,4616,1,Excellent first question. I thought you were going someplace really open-ended right up until the end. :) Also welcome to [cseducators.se]. Why in the world haven't we seen more of you until now?,2018-04-12T09:55:14.583,27
12036,4606,2,What you said is true if you want to build software devs or web dev that knows just enough for what their aim is to but that doesn't include embedded dev for instance. If you don't understand the low level approach I don't feel like people should use more advanced features. Or if they do use those collection they have to code them in the first place to understand how they work.,2018-04-12T10:06:46.503,4900
12037,4616,1,The first clause if from keystage-3 (???11year old to 14 year old). For keystage2 (< 11year old) ?€?at least on of which is textual?€? is missing. So I assume that this is about >11 year olds.,2018-04-12T11:10:06.417,204
12038,4616,1,Have a look at cs-unplugged. They have a lot of resources for teaching computer science without a computer and suitable for specialist and non-specialist teachers.,2018-04-12T11:12:04.920,204

12042,4616,2,Do you really want to focus _just_ on programming or on Computing more generally. There is much more to computing than programming which is only a tool for a larger purpose.,2018-04-12T16:28:50.347,1293
12043,4622,0,I think the purpose behind the emphasis given by the UK curriculum isn't programming as such rather that learning to program creates mental patterns of analysis useful to life as well as education.,2018-04-12T17:23:03.680,104
12044,4613,0,This seems like a fine question to me.  I don't personally have an answer but it certainly seems within scope.  I hope you get some great answers.,2018-04-12T17:26:20.517,27
12045,4609,3,I volunteer teaching 12-14 y/os and this a running theme: Yes you can make a giant if/elif/elif/.../else block... but *I'm lazy* so here is a much faster way to do it. By casting it in that way (and ensuring they are comfortable with using it) they tend to move over pretty quick.,2018-04-12T22:50:53.420,807
12046,4616,0,Thanks guys. CS Unplugged looks really interesting. Buffy I was thinking more in terms of *programming* than *computing*. I do agree with your comment but don't expect too many problems establishing which CS concepts should be taught in school. With programming I'm struggling to define what is and isn't generally useful. I'm also concerned that the Banana Gorilla Jungle Problem will make it difficult to teach a useful subset of any current language but that's a separate issue.,2018-04-13T02:13:08.070,4898
12047,4618,0,The question regards children aged between 10 and 16. I was actually corrected on that point though. The children are 11 when they start programming. I don't think this answer really addresses the question.,2018-04-13T02:17:16.810,4898
12049,4622,0,The idea of focussing on *applications* is interesting and I especially like the idea of integrating the stuff students are studying in other subjects. I'm not sure this answers the exact question asked but I understand it's not a simple question and that it's difficult to even know where to begin. Other answers wonder quite far from the specific issue so I'll mark this as correct.,2018-04-13T02:39:12.593,4898
12051,4617,0,I deleted my last comment as it came across differently to what I'd intended sorry. I really appreciate this answer and upvoted it as it contains a lot of useful relevant information. That said the issue really is to do with programming specifically rather than computational thinking which is much more general. The issue we're having is that every child will spend five years learning to program (typically with Python or JS) and most will not become professional programmers and it is not obvious what programming skills they need. We don't really know what an ideal outcome looks like.,2018-04-13T02:52:08.137,4898
12052,4617,0,_@CarlSmith Don't think of programming as the goal think of is as the vehicle. Learning to program engages a different mental mode of analysis that is useful in _any_ endeavor. Read the entire [paper from Wing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hRnNjUTyBwQu3kadX3unljw-iCZKEuk0/view?usp=sharing) not just my excerpts and it _might_ help with the teaching programming to non-programmers issue. Programming is replacing the now absent courses on rhetoric.,2018-04-13T03:40:00.410,104
12053,4618,0,I edited  my answer to stick a little bit more to the question.,2018-04-13T08:25:50.373,4900

12059,4317,0,In the contest context the first code example is quite clearly overengineered. Literally half of the code is a useless boilerplate. Of course there are advantages to the object based approach but they are all about things like maintainability and extendability: completely irrelevant in the competition environment. Also object-based approach may easily be a red herring: you may start modelling the domain first instead of determining what computation you need and which parts of the domain are really relevant.,2018-04-14T12:32:12.307,4884
12062,4624,1,Long ago I enrolled in a Comparative Programming Langauges class that required me to write at least one program in each of; Pascal Lisp SNOBOL Prolog Forth and OPS5.  Even if I never had used any of those languages in a paying job I still would have ranked that class among the most important that I ever attended.,2018-04-14T17:05:41.337,1269

12064,4624,3,In the University I graduated from the bachelor CS studies (3 years) required people to submit code in about 8-10 languages including Haskell and Prolog  (+ stuff like html and sql). For me it was one of the best things there though pretty tough for some.,2018-04-14T17:34:35.130,4884
12065,3475,1,_@pojo-guy: I am willing to bet there are more deployed JavaScript runtimes in the world than there are COBOL runtimes. For example in my (tiny) flat there are over 20 JavaScript runtimes (7 on my laptop alone) and 0 COBOL runtimes. Almost every adult in the (so-called) developed world is carrying at least one in their pocket.,2018-04-14T20:58:19.560,945
12066,3475,0,_@J??rgWMittag Ok that explains it.  Without that additional information I had no clue what you were talking about. Scheme has never been on my radar before today. Around 80% of the world's actively used code is COBOL (220 billion lines and increasing).,2018-04-14T21:02:08.167,1537

12068,4606,0,_@YCN-: I personally love the low level stuff but I think this advice sounds reasonable.  Getting to the point of understand how different collections work (like sorted maps vs. plain hashes vs. simple `std::vector`) requires some algorithm knowledge and understanding efficiency is only truly possible with some computer architecture (caches) and assembly language (and how source compiles to asm).  Leaving these topics for later in the spiral makes sense: by the time you get to the implementation details and low level stuff students will be ready to understand it better.,2018-04-15T00:22:23.233,1654
12069,4614,0,*I don't see a way to sort these names by using individual variables.*  Hard-coded sorting network where every compare-and-swap is specified separately (hopefully with the compare+swap wrapping in a function call).  A sorting network for 17 elements can be only 71 comparators according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network so 20 elements is at least plausible to write out in the source code and I think there are sites online that can generate them.  Anyway totally implausible for beginners to actually come up with but in other contexts it's not totally unreasonable.,2018-04-15T00:32:07.823,1654
12070,4624,1,Very much this. Back in school (1980s) the CS curriculum started using Pascal and to acquaint ourselves with a completely different programming paradigm we had to chose either Common Lisp or Prolog. I chose Common Lisp and it was instrumental in drastically expanding my computational thought process (and was a lot of fun to boot). I never used Lisp in a professional capacity later other than for some Emacs customization. I also took a Comparative Programming Languages class but it didn't require submitting code so had much less of an impact.,2018-04-15T02:05:37.020,1940

12088,4570,0,Could you provide an example of global optimization that can be done in a high level language and not in the low level language? Describing what to do instead of how to do sounds well in hand-waving but I fail to translate that to any practical examples except for maybe true generics (as opposed to duplicating code either by hand or using templates) but that also can be optimized. Usually there are to problems: (1) In reality the optimization is done at the low level anyway (2) The computation model even in supposedly high level languages tends to be very constrained.,2018-04-18T07:35:13.653,4884
12090,4570,0,_@Frax I wonder if you are confusing what the programmer does with what the compiler can do. With today's fast hardware and sophisticated compilers the relationship between the original program and the compiled version can be anything but simple. Yes the compiler (usually) produces the low level code that is actually executed but it need look nothing like the original notations. In particular a JIT compiler might not even compile some branches of a switch if it knows (from the current execution) that those branches can't be taken. This reduces page faulting and cache misses etc.,2018-04-18T12:36:18.587,1293
12091,4570,0,No I don't confuse it. I'm merely saying that low-level languages are also capable of global optimization and the end code may differ from original just as wildly. In the same time the translation from high- to low-level is often pretty strict. The only language I can think of in which you actually describe what you want to get instead of how to get it is SQL but it has  a very limited application. I'll be happy to see an example of high-level construct allowing a global optimization that can't be done on the low-level code.,2018-04-18T15:16:07.970,4884
12092,4570,0,The issue isn't that it is _theoretically_ impossible to do the optimizations. It is that it can't _feasibly_ be done by a person. A compiler can execute tens of millions of instructions to improve the run-time performance of the resulting code by around 1%. No person can effectively match that. You can in fact get a doctorate in CS for a dissertation that shaves around 1% off of the run time by doing very sophisticated say graph analysis on the program. For reference another language that lets you say _what_ without saying _how_ is Prolog. But OO programs can _hide_ a lot of the how.,2018-04-18T16:48:26.413,1293

12094,4570,1,_@Buffy confronting manual optimizations with compiler optimizations is a false alternative unless you write in asm. For JIT I found [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4516778/when-is-java-faster-than-c-or-when-is-jit-faster-then-precompiled) though it really refers only low-level optimizations. But I didn't find a good example of a global optimization that would be bound to high-level language.

12099,4643,0,_@thesecretmaster I also worry about the relevance here. Perhaps Software Recommendations would be a better fit.,2018-04-19T13:11:54.463,1293
12100,4643,1,hi All.. This is question is not entirely on software recommendation. It is more on tools for creating online lectures that could benefit all educators including computer science educators.,2018-04-19T13:18:15.023,4929
12101,4643,0,This is what you get when you cut everything up. Was teaching about categorisation the other day. How tagging is better that hierarchical categorisation systems (though hierarchies of tags can be good). Don't cut up into categories just tag it. These sites are half and half. They have tags but are cut up into categories.,2018-04-19T13:32:09.333,204

12104,4643,1,As one point I don't like the idea of having to go somewhere else to know what you are talking about (the YouTube link). Secondly if I knew what the video was I still need to know what _you_ want to achieve. I cannot give an answer that's good for you if I don't know the end result desired.

12110,4650,1,Why is it hard to show that factoring is in NP? Long multiplication is clearly in P and that's the most expensive part if the certificate consists of both factors.,2018-04-19T21:29:52.190,1219
12111,727,1,*NP problems are hard to solve* is not true which makes it unclear whether the actual question is about NP NP-hard or something else.,2018-04-19T21:33:52.983,1219
12112,4650,0,It just requires an argument whereas the other parts are almost obvious. It also is complicated by the dual definitions of NP.,2018-04-19T21:35:53.090,1293
12114,4612,0,As much as i enjoyed your answer I have to express my profound disagreement with your last paragraph. Proper naming is about maintainability which is the most important/expensive in software's lifetime. it works has no value if it can't be maintained effortlessly and cheaply. This is real life. And since a good part of good programming is good habits it pays to get into that habit.,2018-04-22T20:36:51.553,3417
12115,4612,0,Another comment about your last paragraph: I'm not sure what you meant by machine code. If you really meant machine code (i.e. 1s & 0s circa 1940s) then i'd add that assembly language emerged from this as the need for naming the 1s & 0s instructions to make them easier to read and debug. It stared by being programmers' written abbreviations on paper for given sets of 10&0s do and evolved into today's assembly language,2018-04-22T20:43:53.780,3417
12116,4612,0,_@Elkady Other than using hex more often than binary your interpretation of machine code is correct. Not all machine code has been converted to assembly yet has been producing quality software without good naming. Yes names help coders and where common conventions exist following them improves the ease of maintenance. As to the OP's question re: importance of good naming to quality software - it is still a red herring. Good names don't make bad code good and bad names don't make good code bad.,2018-04-22T21:45:05.950,104
12117,4612,0,you'll get no argument from me. I see it was a matter of interpreting what good code means. Neither is wrong just different views / schools of thought that was/is debated infinitly for ages.,2018-04-22T22:51:05.703,3417
12118,4612,0,Good software is a living thing. Good naming makes good software evolution easier at lower cost.,2018-04-23T14:44:28.470,2103

12121,4659,6,Nice. Emphasize that you aren't teaching them a particular language or library. You are teaching them _how to think_.,2018-04-26T13:17:49.153,1293
12122,4660,2,That is a great point about the complexity of the data structure API.  And yes C# is the same. ArrayList (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.arraylist(v=vs.110).aspx) having 40+ functions.,2018-04-26T13:20:49.087,174
12123,4659,0,A subpiece of the last point is that while the structures are the same the names and interface of the same structure may be different between languages.  It's a lot simpler to understand that Java HashMaps and C# Dictionaries work basically the same way and accomplish basically the same thing if you understand how a Map works.,2018-04-26T13:42:47.283,753
12124,4655,0,Which test? Is it 5051?,2018-04-26T13:46:59.327,174
12125,4655,0,_@ncynik No the 5651 linked in my question.,2018-04-26T13:48:27.637,830
12126,4662,0,Thanks! I'm not actually taking the test (I'm a college CS professor) but I am working with some high school teachers who would like to take the test.,2018-04-26T14:19:41.947,830
12127,4658,2,I'm not sure that worth an answer on his own but I would try to insist on your last point : writing proper specific component (be Data Manipulation or Graphic components) that behave perfectly is in fact hard/very time consuming and that's why it is always recommanded to search before rolling it's own.,2018-04-26T15:00:02.420,1375
12128,4660,3,using libraries is not only about saving time it is also to reduce the source of bugs in the application and improving maintenability unless you're writing your own library you won't put the same effort in rolling your own component while developping a business application than those who have written proper livrary. In the big scheme you could eventually resume all to it save time but I think it's worth to develop it a little.,2018-04-26T15:01:55.997,1375
12129,4659,1,Another thing you might want to add is that the students might one day have to work in a programming language where the data structure they need is not built-in and they will be forced to implement it on their own.,2018-04-26T15:08:19.350,1577
12130,4660,1,I don't think never write own containers again is necessarily something to take away. Rather they should learn how to *properly* implement those structures. That way if they want to implement a structure for a language that doesn't have such a library they can.,2018-04-26T16:41:08.257,4570
12131,4658,8,Experience working with new CS grads suggests exactly the opposite of (3). So much so that this is one of the main disadvantages of ever teaching these things.,2018-04-26T18:08:35.207,4437
12132,4659,2,`The implementations that the students provide are never at the quality of the built-in language implementation` Don't be so sure of that. The standard library versions frequently have to be super-generic in order to work with all the functions defined over them and to work with any datatype.  It's not that unusual for an implementation tuned to its specific use-case to be able to outperform them.,2018-04-26T23:06:23.630,827
12133,4664,0,One option is to extract an interface (formal or informal) from a library class and have the students implement (and use) their implementation. Then switching to the standard class will be fairly painless. It interface need not even be complete - just enough to be useful.,2018-04-26T23:54:41.573,1293
12134,4664,0,That also works perfectly well if not better. Perhaps making it an requirement to switch between the two and retain functionality (if possible) would make for a good inheritance exercise while also teaching design and implementation. Good addition!,2018-04-26T23:58:03.137,4951
12135,4660,1,_@Walfrat True but it's a bit beside the point. After all the question is about reasons to _not_ use library code. Added some mention about libraries being tested and patched though,2018-04-27T10:59:46.003,4884
12136,4660,0,_@mbomb007 Added perhaps and something about learning general patterns of writing containers. But the point is the experience is important even though there is a fair chance of actually never writing a container again. I mean I don't think you should learn it because you may need to write that very structure is a valid point.,2018-04-27T11:04:05.350,4884
12137,851,1,It's worth noting that recursive solution is really the same just using underlying call stack - so it's not explicitly visible.,2018-04-27T11:15:08.780,4884
12138,4664,0,I love this idea.  Good one.,2018-04-27T11:34:29.807,4338
12140,4658,0,_@TKK are you saying that new grads who know how to implement their own data structures are prone NOT to use built-ins?  If so can you conjecture on why that is true?  Are they over confident?  Are they trying to be heroes?,2018-04-27T11:38:21.987,4338
12143,727,0,A simplified example of why hashing is one-way: the modulus operator (it's also one-way). There are multiple (infinite) inputs that give the same output. Given `x % 10 == 3` what is `x`? It could be any number ending in `3`.,2018-04-27T13:32:31.467,4570
12145,4658,5,_@JavaJive I think the simple explanation is that if a student has only been taught to write code of course their inclination will be to solve every problem by writing code. From my informal surveys of CS grads the skill of identifying suitable third party solutions (features quality licensing etc.) is not something that is taught at all. It comes down to whether you're primarily teaching an academic subject or a trade skill.,2018-04-27T16:39:22.947,4437
12146,4658,2,This reminds me of all the questions on SO where a student is implementing a C++ vector class. Someone will *always* comment Why don't you just use `std::vector`?. When I point out that this is just an exercise in learning how data structures work they'll say that it's a stupid exercise.,2018-04-27T22:02:35.087,1471
12147,4664,0,In my 400-level Operating Systems course our first assignment was fibonacci in C - I'm not sure I'm following the example. It seems that you describe how mismatched your courses were from real-life... but C is for beter or worse lingua franca of system programming - with dose of assembler where required and maybe with C++ thrown in here and there. Maybe in 20 years we will move to Rust or something but as far as OS goes C/C++ has no practical alternative. Assuming you had no exposure to C/C++ Fibbonaci doesn't seem that bad of Hello World...,2018-04-28T08:51:48.467,673
12148,4664,0,Let me explain: a 400 level course is a senior level course as in we don?€?t need ?€?Hello World?€? anymore. My main point being that OP?€?s pupils will likely receive subpar education from their future educators and that the better of a job he does at teaching them the less likely they?€?ll absorb the poor habits of unmotivated professors. I feel though that you may have missed this but I am speaking from my own experiences where I?€?ve felt underprepared due to my own professors and OP has a chance to break that cycle for his students. Is that a bit clearer?,2018-04-28T11:35:24.820,4951
12149,4664,0,I can amend my answer for clarity but I felt that a senior level course teaching a Hello World type application is pretty clearly a waste of time. I felt like it was safe to make such an assumption given everyone?€?s experience with CS here as well.,2018-04-28T11:39:33.017,4951
12150,4668,0,What is the answer? It depends strongly on the potential for cache misses.,2018-04-28T13:27:03.923,3948
12152,4658,1,_@Barmar - They have a point.,2018-04-28T13:49:47.813,3948
12153,4670,2,No references  so this is a comment not an answer. A lot of Tremont in CS is what it is for historical reasons and not related to the way things really work today. I'd say have the discussion. My seven year old is comfortable with we cali it X because that's how it used to work  but it works differently now.. If students in an operating systems course haven't already figured this much out  they don't belong in the OS course IMHO.,2018-04-28T14:14:12.137,1537
12154,4668,1,I think the question is _when_ to teach common data structures implementation.  I doubt you can explain to novices why extensible arrays (ArrayList vector...) have an amortized O(1) cost for add() with the capacity-doubling strategy for reallocation.,2018-04-28T15:35:40.290,2103
12155,4670,0,Before the 1990's each process in Unix had only one thread so they were the same thing. No one had bothered to add threads to Unix because in Unix: Processes are cheep; `select` works so event driven is easy; we have a windowing system (that runs in a different process) so no need to have each application manage its own windowing operations in a separate thread.,2018-04-28T17:13:08.673,204
12156,4670,1,Yes tell them but work it in to a discussion on the difference between threads and processes.,2018-04-28T17:15:15.283,204
12157,4669,1,Actually it doesn't seem like profiling. It seems like using their own performance to try to get a handle on future performance. And your final caveat is important. Ganas. I find the movie _Stand And Deliver_ to be inspiring in situations like this. Go watch it again. Aspire to be as good as Jaime Escalante as a teacher.,2018-04-28T17:33:05.697,1293
12158,4669,0,I had to look up ganas.  Thank you for teaching me a new word.  And I've never seen the movie.  It is now on my list.,2018-04-28T18:47:39.960,4338
12159,4659,0,_@Ray Yes I totally agree with that!  If you remove the requirement for generic you often come up with something easier to implement and more efficient. But generally there is a lot of people and time spent on the generics in languages so for that reason it is hard to beat.,2018-04-28T19:09:13.127,174
12160,4658,0,_@JiveDadson the only point they have is that it's annoying to do that in C++ but that's not a valid point on the general principle. :P,2018-04-28T20:50:16.070,963
12161,4658,4,BTW the answer is quite simple actually. If you want to *teach* computer science students **must** learn implementations of data structures and also they have to know fundamental algorithms. If they don't they won't be able to call them computer scientists... rather they might call themselves amateur coders.,2018-04-28T20:52:03.967,963
12162,4668,0,_@JiveDadson You shouldn't use array lists for inserts or additions to the front only the end.  You shouldn't use linked lists when you want to index to the middle often like list.get(500) use an array list for that.  I once fixed a program that was taking 8+ hours to insert-sort into an arrayList by simply changing the list type to a linked list then it took seconds (I actually re-wrote it correctly later but the initial speed difference from just changing the collection type was staggering),2018-04-29T00:44:32.867,1399
12163,4668,0,_@MichelBillaud the above comment to jive becomes amazingly clear if you have implemented a linked list and an array list they are trivial for even a beginner to implement and doing so is extremely educational.  I admit that waiting to implement a sorted tree or hash map might be more useful if you've had a year or so of practice),2018-04-29T00:49:12.157,1399
12165,4670,0,Thanks to both of you! Its a good idea to work it in to a discussion on difference between the two.,2018-04-29T06:04:45.727,2537
12170,4668,0,Educational and valuable but definitely not trivial.,2018-04-29T16:15:21.307,2103
12171,4658,1,_@AndreaLazzarotto that's... a bold claim. An overwhelmingly large portion of people who receive CS education do not need to know the answer to this question for their career except to pass interviews (which  is ironic). This won't be as true if someone wants to go into academia.,2018-04-29T17:54:24.180,177
12172,4658,0,_@enderland no it's not bold. There is a minimum threshold of knowledge if you want to be called computer scientist and **fundamental** data structures are included. Most people who work as programmers are *not* computer scientist and it's fine. Even among developers some are not (for instance they can be engineers or they can have other backgrounds). You are confusing working in IT with being a computer scientist. You might work in healthcare but you are not a doctor if you do not know how a kidney works.,2018-04-29T18:45:55.410,963
12174,4660,1,+1 for all points but especially appreciating complexity. I have seen some horrible use of built-in/library code where ?€? because it's just a simple call ?€? the user clearly has no idea of what complexity lies beneath. While it's not impossible to gain that appreciation _without_ having had a stab at writing your own implementation doing so (I think) helps enormously.,2018-04-30T09:39:22.343,1372
12175,4658,0,fundamental IO routines? That would be a useful practice honestly but luckily we have engineers for those matters. BTW whatever you expect from people implementing the standard data structures is an essential step in understanding how they work in practice how space is used in memory and so on. Computer scientists are going to need more advanced custom data structures in their jobs... And how are they going to implement them if they don't even know the basics?,2018-04-30T10:48:40.283,963
12176,4658,0,_@Hurkyl as a nice anecdote while working on an iOS app in Swift I just realized the iOS SDK does not provide stacks and queues. I am going to implement them myself obviously but this is only possible because I *did* study them while attending university.,2018-04-30T12:52:26.193,963
12177,4677,3,Code on SO is not necessarily sloppy. Often the type and other information is noise and the OP has created an [MCV example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).,2018-04-30T13:29:07.943,104
12178,4680,0,Yes the overuse of Object/var are different situations but in my experience the tendency for new(-ish) programmers to resort to their use in laziness is about the same.  I do mention to them that a style guide will probably be present in their careers and that they should plan to conform to it.  Having a written one for my classroom would be good practice for that.  Maybe I'll get them to write it!,2018-04-30T14:03:51.830,4338
12179,4677,0,Code on SO is not _necessarily_ sloppy but it is _sometimes_ sloppy IMO and not just when it has been simplified for posting or answering.  The problem is that SO is perceived by beginners as the be all/end all for programming and they will copy code from there with absolutely no question.  They have not developed the sophistication of a filter based on education and experience.,2018-04-30T14:11:58.837,4338
12180,4680,0,Often enough the style guide is _not_ about making the program in its initial state better or the programmer's job any easier. It is however about making the clarity clearer for any programmer who later deals with that code including the author. Few rules in style guides are based on rules in the language but rules in the praxis of the author(s) of the guide.,2018-04-30T14:13:06.083,104
12181,4677,6,Maybe they need to be introduced to the [Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/) stack as well. That ought to give them a view to the differences between clear/muddy code. (Code golf serving as examples of _muddy_.),2018-04-30T14:16:14.983,104
12182,4668,0,_@MichelBillaud I can hardly come up with something easier to implement if the educator controls the feature set! An ArrayList is just a wrapped array--expose get/size(trivial) and add.  Add is only non-trivial in that you need to re-allocate the array when it grows using a fixed size makes it trivial as well.  A LinkedList is the most simple node-based structure. In both cases picking a data type (string or int) removes all generic considerations.  Honestly can you give me any simpler non-demo classes to teach?  Even common demo classes like Employee/Employer/Store are more complicated.,2018-04-30T16:08:40.013,1399
12186,4679,0,I remember when C??? and Java were like this. Containers were containers of Objects (except arrays).,2018-04-30T17:27:45.653,204
12187,4683,0,I am/was a professional programmer too and I always use types when I declare.  The only place I think var is justified is when working with LINQ queries and their results (foreach var...).  Efficiency now causes headaches later.,2018-04-30T18:15:55.380,4338
12188,4683,0,_@JavaJive That's fine... it's ultimately a matter of debate. But honestly as a mildly rebellious student myself I would have chafed under required vars if there isn't an airtight case for them (which there isn't). Then again I don't know much about teaching so I can't say when you should lay down the law and when you should back off.,2018-04-30T18:26:58.653,4976
12189,4677,0,Does `Object x` really do type inference in C#?!,2018-04-30T21:43:45.393,660
12192,4677,0,I wrote some code to verify this but can't figure out how to put it in a comment.  Yes if I create an Object and assign it an integer when I call the number's GetType it returns System.Int32.  If I create an Object and assign it a string and call GetType it returns System.String.  Same with a programmer-defined class.,2018-04-30T22:07:13.757,4338
12193,4677,2,_@JavaJive IIUC `GetType` gets the type of actual runtime _value_ so it obviously has to work. That is different from type inference which is about type of _variable_.,2018-04-30T22:21:27.750,4884
12194,4677,0,Btw is VB unavoidable? Perhaps that's just prejudice but my experience with it (with Xojo but basic syntax is the same) was rather a struggle. The syntax is overloaded with clutter and on the my list of least readable and intuitive languages it lands very high. I think it also forces people to declare types (with long names) whether it makes sense or not which may actually work against you (typing is mostly frustrating and not useful).

12200,4679,0,I think point #2 is one of the most important and it's one that I wish language designers would pay more attention to.  If there are two things a piece of code might plausibly be intended to mean and if a slight adjustment would make the intent unambiguous having a language require that a programmer be explicit in both cases may be better than having it allow one to be implicitly assumed.  From a teaching perspective though I think the issue is probably that if one fixes all the underlying problems that could lead to compile errors one may be close to having a working program and...,2018-05-01T16:46:51.780,2073
12201,4679,0,...this in turn wants causes students to want to reach the point of having their program compile successfully as soon as possible.

12202,4678,0,Variables can be used either to represent values or containers.  One could use a value of type `Horse` which identifies a `Horse` just about anyplace one could value of type `Animal` that identifies a `Horse` but a *container* of type `Horse` which will always a `Horse` any time it's not null is very different from a container of type `Animal` which *initially* identifies a `Horse` but might later identify a `Dog`.,2018-05-01T16:53:43.643,2073

12204,4678,0,If I say `int x=someComputation();` and never write to `x` then within its scope `x` would be synonymous with the value yielded by that call to `someComputation`.

12205,4677,1,If you declare an `Int32` as `Object` you've just boxed a value type which is terrible sloppy coding with real performance implications. If you declare an `Int32` as `var` all you've done is shift the reader's focus on the parts of the code that actually matter as opposed to making your C# read like Java. FWIW you shouldn't even need to mention `var` until you're ready to get into anonymous types and LINQ. Also hover the mouse over `var` the IDE tells you what the compiler type is. `var` has NOTHING to do with `Object` whatsoever. And it's NOT dangerous even less sloppy.,2018-05-01T19:09:05.277,4992

12210,4678,0,_@supercat that isn't the point. If the restriction can't be communicated nor enforced it doesn't _really_ exist. The next person to read the program won't understand it or be bound by your intention during maintenance. The code itself should express your intention. Comments can help a bit but they have to be read and agreed to. Make the code express the intention.,2018-05-01T20:14:43.553,1293

12214,4691,14,*This leads to poor design. If when you create a variable you think of it as an Animal (or in a statically typed language declare it so) then later when you assign a Dog object to the same variable you the programmer have to remember that it is now a dog so that it can accept the sit() method that wasn't implemented in Animal.* Are you sure you're doing this right? If you wanted a variable pointing to a dog you'd declare it as a `Dog`. When all you want is an `Animal` you don't *want* to call `sit()` on it.,2018-05-01T20:42:55.180,823
12215,4689,0,Honestly inheritance in Python/Java/C#/etc. is a tool often used to get around the fact that they don't have templates or mixins (like C++). Genuine need for inheritance (implying late binding and dynamic dispatch) is *far* less common than you would think. But if those are sufficient then the only real example you need is `namedtuple`...,2018-05-01T20:50:22.790,823
12216,4668,0,if it has a fixed size it is not an ArrayList but an array. I agree wrapping an array into an array is rather easy but where's the beef ? My point is implementing such structures require some programming skills that have to be developed before going into it. And they'd benefit from writing interesting exemples that use ready made structures before they are able to reimplement them.,2018-05-01T21:14:08.993,2103
12217,4689,15,As a student I didn't understand inheritance as anything other than an academic exercise until I started looking at GUI toolkits with classes like BaseView GridView ListView OrderedListView etc; and started making my own extensions of these things that it really made sense.,2018-05-01T21:15:00.463,4997

12219,4668,0,_@MichelBillaud our only disagreements is that I think it's easier (or at worse as easy) to implement an array list (with a fixed size say) and then use that to implement your store/employee example.  One of the greatest features of this order is that you discover new requirements in your own code as you proceed (The need for an extendable Array list for example) and that you learn about building a usable class interface.  I guess my only point is that there is a huge benefit to real reusable classes to build on as soon as possible and these two are so easy that it seems to be a no-brainer.,2018-05-01T21:44:56.990,1399
12220,4691,0,_@Mehrdad it is pretty hard to avoid the problem. Suppose you have a list of different kinds of Animal. Some Dogs some Kangaroos etc. When you retrieve them from the list all the compiler knows is that they are Animal. If you only ever want to send messages defined in Animal then you are fine but not otherwise. However If you don't add methods in subclasses then the issue never arises. The complete public interface of any such object is defined in Animal. Over a very short run of code it may be easy to distinguish and remember. Not so much over a long program.,2018-05-01T22:13:31.783,1293
12221,4691,1,_@Buffy if your goal is consistent interfaces you'd use an interface and have each animal implement that instead of using inheritance...,2018-05-01T23:07:10.197,177
12222,4691,0,_@ElysianFields this is Python not Java. Python doesn't have interfaces though you can simulate them. The rule for interfaces is if you implement an interface don't add additional public methods to the class. If you do you will wind up with the same problem of having to know the same concrete type of each object even when it is referenced by an interface typed variable (or in Python by an untyped variable).,2018-05-01T23:25:43.827,1293
12223,4689,1,Inheritance is important  but not as important as interfaces. While I disagree with the assertion that inheritance is a way to get around the absence of templates that c++ offers  I agree that it is over emphasized in teaching OO programming. 90% of the objects you will make outside of a GUI  are descended only from Object.,2018-05-02T00:25:59.327,1537
12224,4677,0,Object does not infer types. You can try assing an int to an object variable and then assing an string to the same variable and it has no problem with it. On the other hand if you declare with var and assign an int it is an int you won't be able to assign a string to it. Using var everywhere is not that bad really. Object is very bad because you lose all the static checks the intellisense and performance is worse in particular with value types. So do not treat Object and var as similar.  Also x and y are not good variable names I get it is an example give good example to students.,2018-05-02T00:33:29.127,1337

12228,4677,0,You confirmed that use of var is up for contention including a link to the discussion then you immediately say that they **must** use the type because using `var` is 'sloppy' (exlcuding previous comment discussion concluding using `object` is actually **wrong** not sloppy).. So you don't actually *believe* that there is a choice in the industry and you're trying to **force your belief** on your students rather than provide all the information.  This is not a good approach.,2018-05-02T09:13:50.480,2455
12230,4689,0,You all should look at Eiffel. It does inheritance properly. You will then see that mixins and interfaces are just a special case of inheritance.,2018-05-02T09:39:00.357,204
12231,4689,0,I have no idea where the idea of inheritance being mainly a GUI thing comes from. As just one counter example look at your computer it has many devices: a printer a pointing device a keyboard a temperature senser a light senser a microphone a network a gps a clock. These all examples of abstract classes (probably implemented it C with no class keyword but still inheritance).,2018-05-02T09:44:30.460,204
12232,4694,8,I don't really care for Minecraft but I like this answer a lot. One thing that bothers me with those standard `Animal=>Dog` examples is that it's trying to explain an abstract concept with a slightly less abstract example - but _to what end_ does an `Animal` even need a `MakeNoise()` function? Instantly obvious with a real life example like this: A sound effect needs to be played when the player is close. Also it's very easy to make some screenshots to illustrate concepts which can make those olde lecture slides more interesting and easier to understand.,2018-05-02T10:05:27.680,5003
12233,4677,0,Step 1: make the students understand the downsides of down-casting. Step 2: Show the students that using Object forces the use of of down-casting. Additionally: explain var vs object and the run-time performance impact of boxing and type checking,2018-05-02T10:45:09.757,5004
12234,4694,3,Yep. I think looking at game related examples is a very good idea because OO is important for game design and it is easy to imagine the code being actually used. I think the block example can get quite complex though. Maybe just define some game objects with a shared draw method an image etc. Add something like health in the mix and you're done. OP could take a look at http://py.processing.org/ and you can even easily draw stuff. Maybe idk snow that turns into rain after a couple of seconds of falling? (position speed lifetime image) and rain falls faster than snow,2018-05-02T10:55:13.883,5005
12235,4689,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor those are examples of a common interface not inherited behaviour. The chances of a GPS driver and your printer driver having any code in common are fairly low given they most likely won't be written by the same company.,2018-05-02T10:55:46.777,1498

12237,4691,0,_@ArturBiesiadowski Good for you. This mental abomination actually goes back at least to the original Turbo Pascal documentation in which Circle extends Point. All you need to do is add a radius field of course. It was further promulgated in a few text books. I won't name the authors and hope that later editions thought a bit deeper about the issue. Taking the easy way out in defining a class often leads to terribly hard to decipher code. If you think of objects as bundles of behavior not sets of fields you do better in thinking about them.,2018-05-02T11:52:28.113,1293
12238,4689,2,_@pojo-guy: Interfaces are a variation on inheritance. Assuming you know neither inheritance is easier to understand than interfaces. The use case for interfaces is rather complex compared to the use case for inheritance. Regardless of which will be used more often in a professional context education should follow a logical progression that makes every step as light as it can be.,2018-05-02T12:46:58.537,2164
12239,4677,0,I don't know enough about C# or Visual Studio : still couldn't you use IDE features for autocompletion or refactoring that work much better (or at all) when every variable is properly defined? Or display warnings when typing `Object x = new Horse(Silver);`?,2018-05-02T12:50:47.033,2021
12240,4691,0,_@Buffy. Bad design is sometimes necessary in the context of education. Hello world is a simple example here. One could berate the developer for using a hardcoded string that is not either clearly a const value or a configurable value; but you'd be missing the point of the exercise: showing the simplest of programs. The `Animal -> Dog` example is similalry flawed in a professional context but it does explain the nature of inheritance rather well. The solution here isn't improving/complicating the example but rather continuing with even better examples after the chapter on inheritance.,2018-05-02T12:58:56.090,2164
12241,4691,1,_@Buffy: Your comment does seem wrong. If you define an `Animal` variable you should never care about _which_ animal it is. The problem is being created by the developer that decided to declare an `Animal` instead of a `Dog` variable. You say the problem is unavoidable but I **strongly** disagree here. The problem is the expectation of the developer after needlessly downcasting their type to the subclass. That is developer error not an inherent design flaw.,2018-05-02T13:02:38.447,2164
12242,4694,0,_@R.Schmitz `but to what end does an Animal even need a MakeNoise() function?` As a simple example imagine hiring a zookeeper who is so new to the profession that he can't recognize which animal it is. But you can already task him to **feed** the animals (assume that all animals eat the same food for now). That would be an argument for `Animal` having a `Feed(Food food)` method since the zookeeper trainee is incapable of distinguishing specific descendants from the `Animal` class. Rudimentary examples are obviously flawed when you look with enough detail but it's a fair first example imo.,2018-05-02T13:06:36.053,2164
12244,4691,0,_@Flater the place for discussion is in the Classroom not here: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom,2018-05-02T13:08:22.477,1293
12245,4691,1,_@Buffy: These are direct counters to your explicit assertions. They are not a tangential discussion.,2018-05-02T13:12:07.293,2164
12247,4691,0,Yeah Buffy I'm not liking this argument either.  If you've got Animal Dog and Whale classes and need Sit() and Swim() functions there's no way you should be programming those methods (or stubs of them) in the base Animal class.  It violates Open/Closed Principle - you'd have to modify the base whenever you add a subclass that needs new functionality.,2018-05-02T13:20:53.897,4777
12248,4691,0,Yes @Flater and you have fallen into a serious error. Come to the classroom.,2018-05-02T13:39:05.957,1293
12249,4694,3,_@Flater I have to admit I'm a bit confused now. I thought it's pretty clear that that was a rhetoric question. Even if you take it as a literal question your example for `MakeNoise()` isn't about `MakeNoise()` at all. And then the actual example is another _slightly less abstract example_ /[spherial cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) when my whole point was that I like this answer because it is 100% concrete.,2018-05-02T14:00:40.643,5003
12250,4691,1,_@Flater: Bad design is sometimes necessary in the context of education. Hmmm. I question that logic. I try hard not to do things in small programs that might lead students to adopt and reinforce bad habits that will haunt them in large programs. No teacher should ever require un-learning in his/her students. Find a better way.,2018-05-02T14:06:09.233,1293
12251,4691,0,_@Buffy: So how do you counter my Hello World example? You're disagreeing without countering the actual example. In a professional context I would negatively review the output of a hardcoded magic string. But in the context of a Hello World application a hardcoded magic string is not an issue. You clearly disagree with the latter assertion. So how would you find a better way to make a Hello World application while adhering to all relevant professional standards?,2018-05-02T14:09:17.830,2164
12252,4694,0,_@R.Schmitz: Are we really going to stumble over the name of the fictional example method used? I was quite clear about referring to a `Feed(Food food)` method. `the actual example is another slightly less abstract example` Because the majority of programming which follows modern day conventions (i.e. a concrete example of programming) is often so loaded with conventions and design patterns that students can't see the wood for the trees. Failing to understand that basic examples are simplified and not pedantically correct to the atom is a failure to understand the purpose of the example.,2018-05-02T14:13:35.117,2164
12253,4691,0,_@Flater I don't use hello world or anything like it actually. My classes start with students exercising objects with a simple interface. They spend about one day writing things in main that will generate a visualization of the simple program. On the second day they start to write simple classes. It requires quite a bit of prior scaffolding. I define a virtual world in which they program. That world is richer than what Java provides and also guides their thinking as they develop. I don't start from the lowest possible level of abstraction.,2018-05-02T14:23:17.810,1293
12254,4677,0,I bet you could come up with a good assignment where you give them some bad code to start with (compiles but has run time errors) and tell them to implement x feature starting from that code base (and oh by the way fix any errors they find)... then let them figure out why it's bad all on their own when they have a headache trying to debug it.,2018-05-02T14:45:33.827,1407
12255,4694,2,_@Flater _stumble over the name_? I'll just assume you meant to change more than the name because `Feed` is a _really_ bad name for a function which is supposed to produce animal noises. What I like about this answer is how it uses exactly a _concrete example of programming_ which can easily demonstrate how - to keep with your metaphor - some trees together make up part of a _real_ wood/forest.,2018-05-02T14:55:19.563,5003
12256,4694,0,_@R.Schmitz: Did you actually read my comment? I'd expect that arguing the validity of my comment comes _after_ actually reading the comment. You seem to completely miss the message but somehow know that it's not correct anyway. You argued that there is a lack of concrete examples and yourself added the `MakeNoise` method name (which was not the direct topic of conversation). I gave you an actual concrete example. I have no idea what you're getting caught up on. It feels like trolling behavior.,2018-05-02T14:57:48.917,2164
12257,4679,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I remember when golang was like that... oh wait...,2018-05-02T14:59:37.213,1790
12258,4694,1,_@Flater I did not engage your cheap stabs like Failure to understand... or the first half of this comment now and I will continue to do so because _that_ feels like trolling behaviour to me. For the second part of your comment: We probably just apply different definitions of concrete here. For me it's not concrete because you didn't get that from actual code used in production - I really don't see any remarkable difference to the standard `Animal=>Dog` or `Person=>Employee` examples mentioned by OP. You will have another reasoning why you think it _is_ concrete.,2018-05-02T15:46:07.280,5003
12259,4689,0,Do you mean inheritance as OOP concept or as practical tool used in Python? I'd say these are quite separate things. Mostly because Python is duck-typed so it usually doesn't make sense to define interfaces in code and so OOP looks differently than in say Java. I assume the first and I think I can write an answer addressing both but it would be best if you clarify in the question what kind of inheritance (interface vs implementation) you are concerned about.,2018-05-02T16:21:26.820,4884
12260,4695,2,The problem with person->employee->manager is that it can be difficult to evolve an Employee into a Manager. This is a frequent use case but the methods (behaviors) open to a Manager are different from those of an Employee and certainly of the general Person. This is thinking of classes as a classification system rather than way to define bundles of behavior. It is the public methods (the behaviors) that make a class what it is. Likewise thinking of objects as bundles of data (rather than behaviors) leads to lots of poor designs. Make Manager a _Trait_ of employee not a subclass.,2018-05-02T16:59:05.367,1293
12261,4698,1,I don't see the need for the `Saver` class here and when that is gone there is no inheritance in that example. In statically typed languages `Saver` would be an interface and not a class and in Python (the language used by the OP) the `Saver` class simply doesn't make sense. Python programmers would just remove it. Duck-typing at work.,2018-05-02T17:03:16.687,847
12262,4689,0,_@PeteKirkham No a GPS is not a printer. A laser printer **is a** printer a ink-jet printer is a printer ?€? The point is not that every thing is a device. But that all printers are printers and all GPS are GPS. (However and this is a totally different argument though still inheritance all devices are files).,2018-05-02T17:03:46.090,204
12263,4695,0,_@Buffy Well it appears to me that the problems you describe are inherent to the very concept of (true as opposed to mere interface) inheritance. Paradigms have shifted away from this pattern towards composition for many reasons yours among them but these examples are what (true) inheritance is about like it or not. If one wants to teach it one has to teach these concepts together with the caveats. [As an aside evolving an employee into a manger is relatively easy in a program compared to the pesky reality...],2018-05-02T18:12:21.507,1675
12264,4695,1,I disagree. I think they are just a consequence of shallow thought and poor design. However if they are poorly taught the situation won't improve. Work for change. Bad design isn't compulsory.,2018-05-02T18:15:45.137,1293
12265,4691,0,While I'm all for composition and shallow hierarchies I understand that having pluggable strategies simply moves the principle problems with inheritance to the strategies (instead of having them in the complex object). The nice thing is that each of the strategies is surely smaller than the complex object holding them: this paradigm is a neat application of *divide and conquer.* (And provides better testability of the complex object and may have other advantages.)  It is not however a principle alternative to inheritance because it still uses it. What am I missing?,2018-05-02T18:43:17.297,1675
12266,4691,0,_@PeterA.Schneider probably nothing. It is just a better and more controllable form of inheritance. Inheritance should model IS-A quite purely not just IS-Like. Every strategy has the same interface. Other small objects can also use inheritance but in a purer way as they model different implementations of the SAME concept not just similar concepts. Modeling the same concept they exhibit the same behaviors and hence have the same interface. Cleaner and easier to live with in the long run. And better to teach the correct path to beginners than the exceptional cases.,2018-05-02T18:48:11.977,1293
12267,4677,0,_@EricDuminil as far as I know the IDE is not fine-grained enough to allow you to define what types of variable declarations are acceptable.  But I will look into it.  That's a great idea.,2018-05-02T21:46:06.373,4338
12268,4677,1,_@freedomn-m As an educator I must have certain expectations in my classroom.  However in no way do I want to pull the wool over my students' eyes.  They know about the controversy surrounding var because I told them and asked them to read about it.  They can meet my expectations and still form opinions.  If they wish to abandon my teaching later then that is their prerogative.,2018-05-02T21:54:19.737,4338
12269,4700,3,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. I'd suggest that you take the time to go through the [Tour](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/tour) and see how this site (like other Stack Exchange sites) is different than most fora you've likely used before. The title of the question asks for a simple yes/no answer while the body seeks input for making the decision. The former doesn't do well here since either answer is valid and mostly opinion-based. The latter is kind of like a tell me what you think which also does poorly. We'd love help you to make this a good question to get you useful answers.,2018-05-02T22:27:03.287,104
12270,4694,0,GUIs are another case where OO is frequently used and important. You can make Swing components with a complete custom look by overriding `paintComponent`.,2018-05-03T01:12:22.340,1275
12271,4698,0,This doesn't save any code it just moves it around.,2018-05-03T03:57:38.007,1275
12272,4694,1,Minecraft can do this because of all of those basic methods that subclasses inherit and override.  Actually many game frameworks do *not* use inheritance in this way because it doesn't work very well.  Instead they use composition.  For example games might have cars boats and amphibious boats... which is easy to do with composition and difficult to do with inheritance.,2018-05-03T04:19:45.730,5018
12273,4694,0,In the practical example a object might have a health component that handles 'take damage' messages that fires a 'death' message to other components that might spawn objects in the game world that can picked up (or straight to inventory).  The spawn object component probably has the relevant settings (e.g. object probability etc.) so can work for many different types without having to be specialized.  Not saying you can't use inheritence as described (not familiar with minecraft myself) and it *is* used in game engines for various reasons just sharing some experiance.  See Unity3D.,2018-05-03T04:22:28.587,5018
12274,4694,0,_@NPSF3000 Pretty decent comparison. I used Minecraft as a) there's an educational version and b) a lot of students are probably familiar with it. Health and damage certainly *works* though its pretty rare for different entity types to need to override that method. (And Unity is my jam ;),2018-05-03T07:25:42.520,1244
12276,3283,0,?? I never got a chance to use C professionally ?? You were lucky you never had to program in C professionally.,2018-05-03T12:49:18.747,2103
12277,3283,0,I got to agree with that and I do count myself lucky. I still dread C :),2018-05-03T16:41:54.357,2605
12278,4689,3,The best thing you can probably teach about inheritance is to avoid it until it makes absolutely perfect sense (and probably even then).  The reason it's hard to find a good teaching example of inheritance is because it's very difficult to find models that really should use inheritance. In the end I've regretted every non-trivial use of inheritance some trivial ones work out pretty well though.  What I've found is that if there is any question whatsoever choose composition/encapsulation even if the objects easily pass the is a test.,2018-05-03T19:51:49.280,1399
12279,4694,0,_@NPSF3000 Exactly In fact I don't think minecraft uses inheritance for the blocks because of this IIRC all blocks have attributes and you just test the attribute.  Inheritance as usual would make the design much more inflexible inconvenient and difficult.  Sometimes you might have very general categories like GroundBlock and AirBlock to say which you can or can't walk through but I don't think minecraft even does this (I haven't programed MC plugins in 5+ years but that's how I remember it),2018-05-03T19:58:20.170,1399
12280,4694,0,_@BillK I do Minecraft moddibg I know what I'm talking about. The example function isn't straight from the code but it is similar to three that do exist (the sample being a kind of merged amalgam). Can or can't walk through a block involves...somewhere around four different functions. [Here](https://github.com/Draco18s/ReasonableRealism/blob/master/src/main/java/com/draco18s/ores/block/BlockSifter.java) is a real example. Seven overridden functions.,2018-05-03T20:34:42.643,1244
12281,4694,0,The important ones in this case are `onBlockActivated` (so that a GUI can be opened) as well as `has` and `createTileEntity` (so that the game knows that special extra class data is needed that can't be stored in a block singleton). Or we could look at [this class](https://github.com/Draco18s/ReasonableRealism/blob/master/src/main/java/com/draco18s/ores/block/ore/BlockHardOreBase.java) that has 13 overridden methods (including `getDrops` which is close to the example in my answer). The important ones are `createBlockState` `getStateFromMeta` and `getMetaFromState` to handle variant info.,2018-05-03T20:44:58.957,1244
12282,4694,0,Ahh you are talking about the modding layer that makes sense.  I was saying Notch didn't use OO as a primary part of his design attributes work much better.  I am however a little surprised that this mod uses overrides for event notification--We figured out how terrible that was in  the AWT days.  Last time I checked Bukkit had the ability to submit a class with annotated methods to auto-create listeners which I thought was a truly brilliant way to avoid all the problems inherent with extending/overriding!,2018-05-03T21:41:04.337,1399
12283,4694,0,_@BillK Oh no Notch/Mojang uses it too. I just can't link to any *vanilla source code* as sharing that is against the EULA. ;) There are 167 vanilla subclasses of `Block` eight entire *packages* for subclasses of `Entity` (arrows snowballs zombies pigs...the player...) 80 subclasses of `Item` and tons and tons of others. Admittedly some of the block ones don't need a subclass (`BlockBone` for example only has a constructor that only calls methods that return `Block` and could have been done in init; e.g. `Block bone = new Block().setHardness(2.0F)`) but the majority are legitimate.,2018-05-03T22:05:09.673,1244
12284,4691,0,I'm convinced that beginners should not even hear the word inheritance until they've learned to model *is-a* relationships with interfaces. If Python lacks interfaces then Python is not an appropriate teaching language.,2018-05-04T06:18:26.827,676
12285,4696,0,`var` is absolutely necessary in some contexts with anonymous types which AIUI was one of the motivations for introducing it. My answer to this question also mentions a situation (`foreach` loops) where getting into the habit of using `var` always will allow the detection of problems at compile-time rather than runtime.,2018-05-04T07:37:11.507,1219
12286,4689,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I think we're at cross purposes. The printer is made by e.g. Canon and the GPS e.g. by SiRFstarII. The devices will not have any code in common (except possibly licensing the same embedded USB stack). The drivers will again probably not have anything in common beyond messaging stacks. The interface the OS uses to the driver will work for any USB driver instance and then layer on top a specialised interface to the device type. At what layer do you think there is inheritance of behaviour from shared code?,2018-05-04T09:01:17.653,1498
12287,4689,0,_@PeteKirkham Yes we are at cross purposes. 1) I run Gnu/Linux so there is a lot of shared code between drivers. 2) Just because there is no shared code. Does not mean there is no inheritance. Inheritance is a concept independent of implementation. Back to point 1. Just because the OS that you use is badly implemented does not prove the point that inheritance is only used for GUI. I write embedded systems. There is inheritance at every layer.,2018-05-04T09:20:03.820,204
12288,4689,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I was under the impression linux drivers were mostly written in C and therefore there is no possibility of inheritance only calling shared libraries of code. When did OO languages become common in linux driver development?,2018-05-04T09:56:23.810,1498
12289,4699,1,Exceptions work differently to most class hierarchies - they are ontological and the type is important whereas in most OO it's the behaviour that is important. They feel more like how you'd use types in functional languages for pattern matching than pure objects.,2018-05-04T10:06:37.440,1498
12290,4691,2,_@KevinKrumwiede too strong. Python is an excellent teaching language but you have to program it like Python not like Java. If you follow simple rules in Python you get great results. But the same is true for Java or other languages. Programming naively in any language can lead to design-disaster. And thinking in one language while programming in another seldom leads to good results. Learn your tools just as any crafts-person should.,2018-05-04T11:58:53.473,1293
12291,4689,1,_@PeteKirkham Linux and Unix is written in `C`. However it is OO. Just as you can write structured assembler you can write OO `C`. It is not as easy. But that is what is done. Unix is an OO operating system. It even has garbage collection.,2018-05-04T12:23:53.840,204
12292,4693,1,Seems like there's a blurring of the lines for separation of concerns here.

12301,4490,0,_@Draco18s Okay and I'm not sure what the point is? I'm only talking about changing the reference of the argument. Are you trying to say that your code proves that Java is pass-by-reference? Because it doesn't.,2018-05-04T21:48:21.987,2068
12306,4693,0,Indeed perhaps `ImageFileInfo` ought to supply `ImageInfo` as a property rather than providing methods acting on the image data. Otherwise I think this is a somewhat realistic example though it could do with an example of a virtual function.,2018-05-05T12:06:14.863,1538

12312,4712,0,Note: it is very difficult to learn OO from learning C++. Even from Java or C# it is difficult. It is much easier to learn OO from Eiffel and then to learn C++ Java and C#. Yes easier to learn all 4 with Eiffel first than to just learn C++.  This is because Eiffel is closer to the OO concept. It has a one to one relationship between the language and OO. E.g. To make an abstract/deferred class: in C++ make all constructors protected or make at least one method pure-virtual (=0) or ...; In Eiffel put the word `deferred` before `class`.,2018-05-06T11:30:04.223,204
12313,4712,2,_@ctrl-alt-delor Well if you want to be a language warrior then maybe Smalltalk/Squeak is even better. But I disagree. Other languages can effectively teach OO. The reason that it is difficult in C++ is the same reason that everything is difficult in C++. It is a complex language and its object model is especially complex. It is much better suited to things like Templates in which the Standard Template Library is (or at least was) completely implemented using compiler tricks with no run-time effect at all. Objects on the stack vs on the heap is a very big deal conceptually and operationally.,2018-05-06T13:42:31.537,1293

And we have not even got started. One thing good that can be said about C++ is that it the only language (that I know of) that allows static checking of dimensions ( $f=ma$  ($N=gms^2$)) to be implemented.

12316,4712,0,By ?€?hello world?€? I mean the first program there is a lot of stuff that needs explaining or ignoring. This is very unsatisfactory for the learner or teacher.

12322,4713,0,_@PeterTaylor. Yes but that is still for an economic reason not an educational one. Even Oxford has to scale up these days. I don't know what they would do with four students. With 20-100 students lectures are OK if not very personalized. Combine them with tutorials and you add value. But if you don't have to scale up why use those sorts of solutions? Just do what's best for your students.,2018-05-07T09:56:28.463,1293
12323,4713,0,I'm not saying that OP should deliver a lecture to one person.

12325,4713,0,_@PeterTaylor you are missing an important point or I am. Are you suggesting that since Oxford has had to scale up education to teach say 60 students in a class in STEM subjects and so uses lectures for _efficiency_ that someone with only 4-5 students should _not_ use tutorial only? I'm pretty sure that the professor who teaches 60 in lecture is likely _not_ the one that also runs 15 tutorials twice a week. Use lecture as appropriate but STEM shouldn't be the deciding factor. Scale is. Use what is best for the students.,2018-05-07T14:06:05.563,1293

Otherwise it's like using C# as an example of a functional language: you can write functional code in C# but that's not the same thing,2018-05-07T14:52:24.297,1219

I simply prefer to not have that extra strain on my attention during a lecture. (this is all my personal experience as a past and current student),2018-05-08T20:51:28.520,5052
12361,4729,0,I agree wholeheartedly with your conclusion but am not sure I agree with (6). There are compelling reasons to use teaching languages -- there aren't many jobs available writing Racket but [HTDP](http://www.htdp.org/) is rightly lauded as a curriculum that teaches concepts applicable across a wide range of languages and its use of Scheme is highly defensible: Becoming fluent in languages with a wide range of concepts even when not actively used outside academia makes it far easier to learn mainstream languages that adopt those concepts in the future (as is happening today with lambdas &c).,2018-05-08T21:06:55.540,5084
12362,4718,4,_@LightnessRacesinOrbit: Java programs are never frictionless but in their natural state with mass approaching infinity they do approach becoming perfectly spherical.,2018-05-08T23:43:44.407,1327
12363,4727,2,I spent a fruitless year trying to figure out prolog in 1985. When I finally got something working (towers of hanoi)  I redid it in pascal in half the lines and about 15 minutes and I understood what I had written. I have never looked at prolog again.,2018-05-08T23:44:32.073,1537
12364,4717,3,I tend to couch things in terms of mostly and sometimes and depending on exactly what version of... especially in areas of flux (ie teaching Linux admin and referencing Debian 8 Ubuntu 16.04 Debian 9 and Ubuntu 18.04 and initialization the use of `ip` vs `ifconfig` and `route` etc.)  I think the Science Of Discword explained it - this Discworld wiki gives a nice summary of Lies to Children which this is qualifying as... https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Lies-To-Children,2018-05-09T00:14:46.553,662

12366,4727,0,Why would you use it as 'programming language' (instead of a tool to teach aspects of logic and logic formulas ... )? When I started my studies we had two different subjects one was programming and another was logic. In the ladder we solved (simple but complex for us) logic problems with logic programming.,2018-05-09T05:38:13.173,5089
12367,191,0,For me HTML and CSS got me into the field of computer science. So it might not be a programming language but if the goal is 'to show the children to write some code and the pc reacts to it' then it's well-suited to start with. Real programming might be the next step.,2018-05-09T05:49:15.903,5089
12368,4731,1,To be fair students losing confidence can be a good thing - if it leads them to being critical of everything they learned they can *do better*. It can also help them learn in the first place by making things more interesting. But that's probably a minority (at least in modern school systems); most people will carry their misconceptions to the grave (or the next serious project where this lie actually matters :P).,2018-05-09T07:27:29.093,1816
12369,4734,4,Welcome this is a very good question. It fits well here. We don't care who you are (it is not ?€?a site for educators of computing?€? it is ?€?a site about education of computing?€?). I will not answer except to say that I think there is far too much measuring ability and not enough educating in school (and universities). You can not make something grow by measuring it you have to feed it. see work of Carol Dweck. e.g. https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve,2018-05-09T10:28:51.400,204

12372,4523,0,I would make the functional requirements pass/fail and leave it at that.  If they miss a piece of functionality use that as the opportunity to tell them if you think it was because they wasted time on the bells and whistles.,2018-05-09T10:50:40.603,1874
12375,4729,0,As a third party it seems to me that Charles' point addresses *Why teach a student something that won't get them hired?*. I would also note that I interpreted *Not that I find that agreeable but that is reality* as referring specifically to the previous sentence rather than to the whole paragraph.,2018-05-09T12:37:11.890,1219
12376,4734,5,*...so I attribute* ***all*** *of my learning to ...* Wow that's a strong statement.  Colleagues are wonderful but don't be afraid to take *some* credit.  You also took the time and put in the effort to actually learn the things.,2018-05-09T12:39:58.420,27
12378,3740,0,As you say if there is a list or known (or determinable) number of things use `for` or `foreach` (or equivalent) - loop through an array iterate through POST values etc.  If the required number of cycles is unknown (reading from a file letting a user guess something etc) then it is a `while` or `until` (or equivalents),2018-05-09T12:55:21.497,662
12379,4717,1,unlike abstract classes interfaces cannot contain any code - My CS1 professor said the same. Problem is I had my OCJP when I took his class. I told him about `default` in Java 8 which he did not know about. He later added an asterisk and a small footnote explaining the Java 8 update and adding generally... to his statement. I thought it was a good solution.,2018-05-09T13:08:19.950,4858
12380,4729,0,I modified a word to make it (hopefully) match your intentions more clearly.  (Feel free to roll back if I erred)  I think we were all reading that sentence the way @PeterTaylor did.,2018-05-09T13:44:54.527,27
12382,4736,1,This is a great answer and gives some insight as to some of the reasons and motivations that are worth looking into closer. I don't plan on weaponizing what you've said here I'm just looking for good leads to discuss with faculty and try and come up with some potential new approaches to try. This answer satisfies that fairly well. Thanks!,2018-05-09T14:50:24.317,813
12383,4737,0,Mentioning that these goals sometimes conflict each other is definitely worth noting... That's an important perspective to keep that sometimes you have to stroke a balance between them.,2018-05-09T14:51:31.307,813
12384,4739,1,I've also noticed the pattern of the second population of students and am constantly trying to think about ways to encourage students to go further to understand... I think it's due to students simply focusing on getting their assignments done as quickly as possible due to other priorities. Addressing that might even deserve a question of its own.,2018-05-09T14:53:28.737,813
12385,4738,1,I admire the flexibility in how you conduct your labs... The labs in our curriculum are very structured and using sites like StackOverflow is a big no-no. I'd love the opportunity to change and allow students more flexibility in solving the problems but one good question is how you encourage the students who have a good understanding of the material to share their knowledge with other students instead of simply completing the assignment and leaving.,2018-05-09T14:56:16.243,813
12386,4729,0,Peter interpreted my objection correctly -- the argument seemed to apply not just to Prolog but to *any* programming language not currently in widespread use outside academia. Features from academia make it into commercial languages over time -- see the introduction of lambdas to widespread commercial use in Java 8 CSP in Golang etc; people who learned academic languages with those features would be better prepared to use those today even if those languages do not themselves have commercial value.,2018-05-09T15:14:31.413,5084
12387,4729,0,(See also the Blub Paradox from Paul Graham's Beating the Averages discussing the importance of teaching high-level concepts.

12393,4718,11,_@Mark Mathematics also. We definitely don't want to say things to first graders like In studying addition we are really looking at an Abelian group (which will later be extended to a field by adding a second operator). Some of you may be questioning whether it's truly a group and what the cardinality of the underlying set is due to your current understanding of numbers. So we will answer those questions by expanding our discussion to countably infinite sets and additive inverses.,2018-05-09T16:01:05.637,939
12394,4718,5,It may not be a bad idea to be pedantic *once* as an explanation for why you aren't always going to go into detail. It also gives you a way to derail a student who wants to dig into the details at an inappropriate moment - they can check back during office hours (or whatever) if they want more detail.,2018-05-09T16:10:18.140,5100

12396,4718,0,_@PabloH has the correct idea.  My own preference is _abstraction_ in the CS sense alternatively:  A _Wittgenstein's ladder_ is a simplified explanation of a technical or complex subject that is used as a teaching tool despite being technically wrong. (cf wikipedia),2018-05-09T17:16:58.150,3390
12397,4722,1,This is good. I was advanced for my course and when teacher lied I thought it was because they didn't know better. If they said generally speaking it peaked my curiosity to look at it further.,2018-05-09T17:34:26.410,5103

12400,4722,2,The phrase generally speaking is great because it invites a student to treat something applies in the cases that are going to follow but discourages excessive inferences that might lead the student astray.,2018-05-09T19:12:25.857,2073
12401,4748,1,I hadn't considered having students send an update. What's nice is that they wouldn't  have to say if I pointed out the mistake or if they discovered it through subsequent research.,2018-05-09T19:17:37.943,283
12402,4748,0,_@EllenSpertus yes. Exactly my point. They learned they passed on the learning. Copacetic. In fact they might learn something even if they didn't err and might want to add it to the written report. The questions they get might induce changes.,2018-05-09T19:19:19.077,1293

12431,4717,4,The Lie-to-Children paradigm is pervasive in education. In elementary school you learn that the sky is blue.

In grad school you are led to wonder what the defintion of blue was anyway the historical context of defining the sky as blue and what the likely social economic and political ramifications of a non-blue sky would be.

It's more like a final consolation than a study plan :) But I guess it could be worded differently - it's a good thing if students don't take their teacher as an authority. That doesn't mean quite the same thing as ignore that stupid old fart - a teacher that isn't afraid to admit he doesn't understand or know something is a great bonus. Not assuming everything you say is right just because you're a teacher really leads to *more* confidence.,2018-05-12T08:16:57.867,1816
12447,4717,1,Some lies are okay some other lies aren't. For example professors I know have taught students that reading the value of an uninitialized local variable in C and C++ will evaluate to whatever garbage was in that place in memory.

We should *not* be teaching children that atoms are the smallest unit; the only reason we do is because that was the state of the art a long time ago. It's not  anymore and we should stop saying it. Physics in particular is rife with this problem. Students get taught Newtonian gravity as a Law of Gravity then hear Newton was Wrong Einstein said so and this decreases trust in science. We should be saying This was the Newtonian Approximation it's good enough in most cases.,2018-05-12T18:09:16.223,5158

12453,4759,0,Thanks can you suggest a better place for this type of question?,2018-05-12T23:50:28.693,5161
12454,4759,0,The ACM SIGCSE mailing list might be a start. Membership required though.,2018-05-12T23:52:04.053,1293
12455,4759,0,Part of the problem is probably based on employ-ability. Wages might be higher in functional programming positions but a high wage only applies when there is a job to be had. Check out the current SO [Developer Survey results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages),2018-05-13T00:59:56.553,104
12456,4759,2,I don't really think employ-ability would be affected.  Learning FP first would make you better at any language because you would more instinctively avoid shared mutable state better encapsulate effects in the type system etc.  Also few people end up working exclusively in the languages they learned in school.  Learning new languages on the fly is par for the course in a programming job.  This is more about what fundamental techniques are the right ones to learn first.,2018-05-13T02:15:15.557,5161
12457,4674,0,You may be able to formally define and show correctness of that set of methods but you can't prove they are minimal.  In fact it turns out that `push` and `tryPop` (and optionally `blockingPop`) are a much more useful public API for a stack or queue.,2018-05-13T03:25:12.477,5163
12458,4759,1,It's probably because functional programming is still an esoteric skill so there are a limited number of people who can do and teach it well.,2018-05-13T03:57:16.237,1537
12459,4717,2,*Is it better to lie to students or to be pedantic when teaching Intro CS?* Porque no los dos? :-),2018-05-13T05:01:30.120,823
12460,4717,1,An insignificant inaccuracy can save a lengthy explanation.,2018-05-13T09:14:09.380,5166
12461,4674,0,_@BenVoigt Right I removed the minimal part. Regarding useful: Of course one could say e.g. that `top` can be emulated with `tryPop` and `push` (or `isEmpty` is just `top==null` or so). (And whether the operation should be blocking is another dimension of the design space). The main point was that 1. there could be a set of methods that resembles the operations that one can apply to a *real* stack (e.g. a deck of cards) and 2. the set of methods should be small formal and sufficient in order to navigate through the *state space* of the object that they operate on.,2018-05-13T13:44:34.663,2393
12462,4674,0,Well the problem with separating `isEmpty` `top` and `pop` operations is the TOCTOU window.  Even before students start using parallel algorithms it's useful to start thinking in operations that won't break in an interruptible context.,2018-05-13T16:14:19.877,5163
12463,3564,0,(a side note) FWIW Scheme's typical wall-of-words code can IMO be made more readable by generously adding more white space inside and by aligning various entities visually. that's *not* the accepted style of course; so what if it helps. (see e.g. [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48694546/849891) to see what I mean; or even [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49631993/849891) which is a bit over the top). and using *short* variable names!,2018-05-13T18:45:26.140,3806
12464,3564,0,_@WillNess a student of McCarthy's and one of the developers of CLOS told me that he can understand lisp code from a distance just by looking at the visual structure. That assumes the standard formatting of course. I have no reason to doubt him as he is reliable in all known ways.,2018-05-13T18:54:55.760,1293

12466,4717,1,It's better to lie - and don't make a note of it - at the time. This is true of all teaching. As you go deeper into it you can revisit and expose those lies.,2018-05-13T23:14:15.207,4067

12469,4762,0,_@Buffy your question seems to be about teaching students to use good names. My question is about teachers using good names (choosing languages and libraries etc.).,2018-05-14T12:06:07.637,204
12470,4762,0,I note that this isn't a research question. In fact it would likely be considered unethical to do the experiment as you would be subjecting some students to practices that you already think might be worse than others. This sort of thing makes ed research very tricky. You aren't allowed to disadvantage someone just to learn something.,2018-05-14T13:14:12.680,1293
12471,4766,4,I see two errors here. People can think functionally just as they can procedurally. It just takes education and practice. And practice. It is a different way of thinking but accessible to all. Secondly functional programmers in Lisp or Haskel (other choices...) don't in fact build everything from scratch. There are sophisticated libraries for functional languages just as for the others. CLOS for Common Lisp is one example. In fact the ability to do meta programming in functional languages just becoming possible in Java permits very powerful constructs to be built and leveraged.,2018-05-14T16:24:15.340,1293
12472,4766,1,I have to agree with Buffy the toolchains for FP are just as if not more sophisticated than the ones for imperative programming.  In fact because of the ease of i.e. composing monads or using higher-kinded types you often have to do a lot less of the grunt-work yourself in FP than in OOP.,2018-05-14T16:29:46.023,5161
12473,4761,0,Good points about the inertia and meeting expectations for entry-level positions.  I wonder if it still might be beneficial to teach both paradigms in introductory courses so that when it comes to learning basic data-structures like implementing a red-black tree the student can implement the tree in a language like ML or Haskell where inductive types are simply defined in a few lines of code as opposed to implementing the tree in C or Java where it would be much more verbose and the functionality of the tree would be obfuscated by the mechanics of the language.,2018-05-14T17:20:25.010,5161
12474,4762,0,_@Buffy so instead we continue to subject all pupils to a practice that we think may be worse. That is logic (should the members of the ethics board do a CS course?).,2018-05-14T17:49:19.420,204
12475,4753,0,I've had a student struggling in my Linux Admin I class (so about halfway through a 2 year degree OR at the end of a 1 year certificate) who couldn't follow a simple list of directions (1 - download ISO image at ... 2 - Burn ISO image using GUI utilities etc).  Asked him why he was having problems he had some literacy issues.   I asked him why he got into the IT field he said because my high school guidance counselor told me it would be working inside instead of roofing like my dad.,2018-05-14T17:52:39.517,662
12476,4761,2,I think a bad idea. Students can wind up thrashing mentally. Paradigms if they truly are are distinct. Their mental models can conflict. Give students a solid base in one before you try to teach them to think different. Then you can be more clear about the advantages of each.,2018-05-14T18:28:06.287,1293
12477,4762,0,You are misconstruing my words. Please stop. If you think something is an improvement use it. If you later get evidence otherwise stop it.,2018-05-14T18:29:45.733,1293
12478,4753,0,Maybe he will find enlightenment somehow. All who struggle are not lost. Some have a longer and harder path than others. As teachers we do what we can but success doesn't lie behind every bush.,2018-05-14T18:33:09.440,1293
12479,4766,0,See for example: https://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744/. If you want to make someone very happy buy the hardcover. Hmmm. I actually have one of those.,2018-05-14T19:39:34.863,1293

12484,4762,3,I do not see this as a duplicate of the question about teaching naming practices. As the OP has stated this is about the names already assigned in existing libraries and language bases and how those names affect the students' learning.,2018-05-14T23:15:09.503,104
12485,4769,0,After reading the referenced page I'm not sure that it the fictitious example or the article _does_ explain the core principles of blockchain as a concept. It helps understand how _Bitcoin_ works on top of a blockchain but not even what a blockchain is. With prior knowledge of blockchain it _might_ be helpful. It is _clear as mud_ without that prior knowledge however.,2018-05-15T01:29:50.957,104
12486,4769,0,My Spidey-sense is tingling. There's probably a great lab in there somewhere but that article was not clear at all. I'd be interested in what others have to say.,2018-05-15T02:44:15.277,27

12488,4770,3,The problem is when you read `turtle.left(30)` you have 2 possible understandings : move it 30 units to the left or change its direction (anti-clockwise).  You have to remember which on is the correct interpretation which causes an extra cognitive load (we already have to remember the left from the right :-)). So it has a negative impact. Could be avoided with better names.,2018-05-15T07:58:11.990,2103
12489,4770,0,_@MichelBillaud As I understand it the turtle cannot *move* left any more than a car can. That means left can only mean turn not move. The *mental model or metaphor is incompletely developed if the choice of move or turn arises from the command left.,2018-05-15T09:12:59.720,104
12491,4770,0,_@GypsySpellweaver the students have no idea that a sprite on the screen can only go forward. What is constrainning it? Yes there is an incomplete metaphor. But we have to start at the beginning. I can see that a way around the problem is to take them to the playground and have them pretend to be a turtle. Have some instructions printed that they can hold. As for words not mattering I have one thing to say to that: Correct horse battery staple.,2018-05-15T10:45:24.407,204
12492,4768,1,With modern hardware the way the system actually works is so different from traditional understanding that I think it's actually counterproductive to think about it.  From superscalar architectures to branch prediction and multi-core platforms the way a CPU works internally is now very complex.  I think it's better to let the computer engineers think about how the hardware will work and have computer scientists focus on writing well-designed maintainable software especially given the increasingly platform-independent nature of software development.,2018-05-15T12:04:52.323,5161
12493,4768,1,This blog by Raymond Chen (a C developer working on the Windows OS at Microsoft) is informative:  https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140613-00/?p=743.  The branch predictor will completely change the expected execution of your code anyway so best just not to try to anticipate the hardware behavior and focus on the quality of the software.,2018-05-15T12:13:06.170,5161
12494,4768,1,_@AaronM.Eshbach You mean the Software Engineers? Computer Scientists shouldn't be particularly focused on writing software well-designed maintainable software unless that is their area of focus/research. Computer Scientists *should* be focused pretty squarely on understanding complex interactions algorithms and computation. Branch prediction and superscalar architectures are great areas of modern interplay between CS and engineering.,2018-05-15T13:09:25.550,27
12495,4768,1,Perhaps Software Engineering would be the more appropriate discipline.  There wasn't really a Software Engineering major when I attended university so I don't know what that covers.  At the school I attended Computer Engineers took a blend of hardware and software courses (including Digital Design and working with FPGAs etc.) while Computer Scientists took almost entirely software courses with some basic education on K-maps and the like.,2018-05-15T13:13:58.293,5161
12496,4768,0,_@AaronM.Eshbach Yeah my major was not dissimilar. But things seem to be improving on this front. More schools are offering legitimate SE degrees which really has blossomed into its own distinct field. I'm hopeful that this shift should be freeing CS majors to spend more time engaging in theory.,2018-05-15T13:19:10.053,27
12497,4770,0,_@GyspySpellweaver moving to the *left of the screen* if you are not lucky enough to have a real robotic turtle on the floor. It is a *simulation* only.,2018-05-15T13:21:11.457,2103
12498,364,0,This isn't right. A notational machine is itself an analogy for a similar more realistic process. The famous oft-(over)stated danger of analogies should really only be considered the danger of *poor* analogies. I would argue instead that connecting new ideas to older already encoded ideas (a literal physical manifestation of analogy) is the most basic mechanism of how we learn.  Great analogies are not at all an indication that something is too complex to be taught.,2018-05-15T13:58:15.530,27
12499,4729,0,If common use in industry were the core requirement for choosing a language to teach we'd all still be programming COBOL and FORTRAN.

12501,364,0,A notional machine is not an _analogy_. It's a faithful representation at some human-comprehensible level of abstraction. It should at least be sound if not complete. Analogies by definition are going to be unsound at some level.,2018-05-15T18:15:24.940,290

12511,4732,1,It's not that they want to talk to you about it. It's that they go out of class and say I was just taught today that everything I thought I knew about gravity was wrong and my middle school teacher lied to me/didn't know better. It turns them off of learning more. As I said Physics is *especially bad* about being taught as if the last hundred years of advances didn't exist and then re-teaching them Oh all that stuff is out of date. It inhibits learning.,2018-05-16T13:28:39.327,5158

12539,1299,1,_@Gilles This indirection is there whether you like it or not. Functional languages like Haskell only formalize it. And in Haskell there is no rand function like in imperative languages. If you want a random number you really need to feed the world state (or PRNG state) into the function and you get back the new state. Formal semantics are just the same as of mathematical function.,2018-05-17T23:18:41.903,4884
12540,4674,0,_@vonbrand Agree. I'm not sure how to convey this importance to CS learners. I think that the idea of Classes being DataTypes being part of an *Algebra* might help as well as thinking about what is the *minimal* set of methods that is necessary to operate properly. (This could be aligned to the language. Roughly: In Java I tend to *always* write *only* `interfaces` to flesh out the structure (even if there may be an `abstract` class that implements some convenience methods).

12543,4785,5,This is an awesome answer.  So many people don't seem to get that programming is a skill just like woodworking blacksmithing or writing.

12548,4785,7,What I do when I get 15 year old school short-term interns at work is perk their interest. Often it's games like World of Warcraft or FIFA or something. Writing a web scraper or an API client with them to do statistics on something they have intimate knowledge of is great. When EA had an online platform for FIFA I built a little league calculator to use with all his friends' account names and it would compute funny stats like how often someone dominated a game but lost anyway because sometimes a game is just like that. Those things  are very well received.,2018-05-18T09:14:00.357,3380
12549,4785,9,_@AustinHemmelgarn That's far from generic. I really enjoy programming for the sake of programming I rarely care much about the end result. The shape and flow of the code matters.

12550,4785,0,_@pipe And if you talk to really experienced carpenters or smiths or even writers you will find individuals who feel the same way.  That mentality is a common one among artisans but it's one that's hard to foster with skills like programming where partially complete products are rather abstract in comparison to more physical skills and progress is hard to quantify.  Note that I am not saying programmers shouldn't take pride in their work or enjoy it (I do so myself) just that it's a case where results matter more than exact technique used.,2018-05-18T10:23:51.213,2523
12552,4783,1,Yes there are a lot of people who do programming in their leisure time and put things on github and so on. But many do it only because it is a valuable sometimes the only counting thing which matters during an application or as part of learn something new. Personally most of my stuff I have on Github is not their because I enjoyed the work on it but because I liked the Reward and Acknowledgement from the Community around it.,2018-05-18T10:35:16.183,1581

12557,4796,3,The path of your daughter is very similar to that of my son. His first programming attempts were in Minecraft (code blocks). Now he is learning on FreeCodeCamp. We tried to learn Unity several times. First we did the ball game tutorial. Then he told me he wants to build a small platformer. I wrote the code for it so that he will can tinker with it. It didn't happen unfortunately (I feel that Unity is intimidating him by its complexity). Next Sunday I'm going to explain to him how every part of this simple platformer works. I also showed him L??VE framework Qubicle and Scratch.,2018-05-18T12:36:28.630,4022
12558,4797,0,I'm not sure your examples illustrate a difference between functional and imperative programming.  Your verb-phrases would all be function names the only difference is that in FP instead of mutating the state of my location dinner and the dishes the functions would return the my new location the cooked dinner and the washed dishes.  If you wanted to do those things in order and pass the groceries we bought at the store into cook dinner and the dishes from dinner into do the dishes we just use composition.,2018-05-18T12:38:13.267,5161
12559,4798,0,Better management can solve this problem. Two quick ideas. First each student should be told up front that each is responsible for all. Second the assignment shouldn't be such that they can divide up the work and each do _their half_ only. Group work should be done cooperatively not individually. You may need to teach them how to do this of course. Don't assume that it will be natural for them any more than you assume that other ideas in the course will be grokked automatically.,2018-05-18T12:43:49.127,1293
12560,4689,0,_@nexus_2006 for me it clicked in operating systems (yes written in C of all languages). There are lots of commonalities to abstract out as classes in there. And it is done. E.g. Linux is a giant OO program.,2018-05-18T12:45:27.617,5219

12562,4797,1,_@AaronM.Eshbach you *can* model it that way but it is a world away from how you naturally *think* about it.

12568,4798,0,_Demands_ aren't likely to be adhered to. You have to teach them how and also insist on it. But it has to be clear from the beginning. If your scheme permits splitting the work then the student has a valid grievance and shouldn't be penalized. But the choice of assignment itself need not be amenable to splitting and the instruction can emphasize cooperation. You may also need better communication with the students so that when the inevitable problems occur (student drops out) you have time to make corrections.,2018-05-18T13:20:47.457,1293

12571,4791,1,`All you need is pure C++ compiler` - C++ is the reason why I struggled hard in the beginning. Too far from anything tangible too many unimportant things (to the final result) to think about. If someone suggested me Python then the history could be drastically different.

12572,4795,1,Getting very good at something (esp. in comparison to others) that you can see is helpful to people can spark the passion. Especially when you integrate your unique strengths into it.

12574,4717,0,_@AlexanderM The issue isn't being willing to update my course. It's not wanting to confuse students by introducing more information than is needed.

12575,4760,0,True but no student is going to go straight from CS 1 to a job interview or industry; nor would I expect them to do independent programming in which the oversimplification misled them before taking a more advanced class or doing additional reading.

12578,4803,0,Teaching Scheme from first principles to developers that already know C# will require them to unlearn quite a bit regardless.  I'm not sure that showing them the C# version is that harmful--especially if one sticks to very isolated code fragments of C#,2018-05-18T17:43:25.087,4689
12579,4789,5,Wait I'm not supposed to enjoy programming? Guess I must be doing something wrong then... Otherwise you're correct that when it comes to programming sometimes the goal is more important than how you get there (the specific language or tool used).,2018-05-18T18:06:31.713,2618
12580,4785,2,If the OP's son likes Minecraft you can create [**Redstone Circuits**](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_circuit) (logic gates clocks computers you name it).

12581,4789,0,_@Llewellyn A whole bunch of previous comments got deleted. Anyway point is that the fun bit is working out how to do something *with* programming. Just writing for-loops on a napkin is not so much fun. :),2018-05-18T20:39:26.477,1864
12582,4783,1,Personally most of my stuff I have on Github is not their because I enjoyed the work on it but because I liked the Reward and Acknowledgement from the Community around it. I program for enjoyment and don't care about recognition. When I publish a Github library creating something that helps other people is a side effect of doing something I enjoy or writing something for my own use. I've also genuinely never met a programmer who has stated their reason for programming is for reward or recognition until now.,2018-05-18T22:10:13.737,1538
12584,4785,1,To accompany this answer I'd recommend a beautiful video set to Alan Watts' words [Life is Not a Journey](https://youtu.be/qHnIJeE3LAI).  I find it to be a very useful kick-in-the-pants to remind me to think the way Kevin is recommending.,2018-05-19T00:14:05.210,812

12586,4783,3,_@Pharap Indeed that's clearly seen by the gigantic amounts of code on GitHub that clearly isn't targeted at the general (programming) public - it's just some code somebody wrote to either play around with something or to solve their very specific problem. As silly as it might sound people have different motivations - some are in it for the coding fun some for the end results some just to try something new (and get feedback if they're lucky) some for recognition... You can't really generalise much. Different people often do the same thing for different reasons :),2018-05-19T07:32:48.893,1816
12587,4784,0,And the main purpose of you as a teacher is to prevent them from going too deep too soon. Too many people want to learn programming while making a game kind of like GTA but bigger and better! Unless you already know that particular person loves challenges bigger than them this is a very quick way to lose all interest. You might find that finding relatively simple goals is surprisingly difficult - people aren't quite used to that anymore. They expect to go through 20 years of education and then do something great and amazing rather than going over obstacles one at a time.,2018-05-19T07:35:53.553,1816
12588,4789,4,Don't take people's fun away :P After all plenty of people enjoy ??tudes practising over and over until they're second nature. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean nobody does - though just as certainly just because you do doesn't mean you should expect everyone to have the same fun with your learning approach. Teachers cannot teach the same way they learned themselves - that will only help the few pupils who enjoy the same approach. And I certainly know lots of programmers who don't care about results at all (usually for the worse mind you) just building crazy object hierarchies...,2018-05-19T07:40:13.150,1816
12589,4796,0,_@DP_ I've had the same experience with Unity. It's a great tool/framework but... maybe a bit too powerful for just having fun programming and learning. At the same time the downloadable content doesn't fit together well enough to be a good learning experience on its own. I've been experimenting with writing a simpler gamedev experience for newcomers to programming that allows them to follow from simpler approaches to more complex approaches but I'm not sure it'd actually help anyone who doesn't learn the same way I do :P And sometimes it's really hard to notice a big jump in complexity :),2018-05-19T07:45:43.873,1816
12590,4786,0,Interestingly I've been programming since about 6 years old and still loving it 24 years later but... I've *always* hated puzzles. The brilliant thing about programming is that the challenge doesn't have a pre-planned solution that you're trying to find - and for me programming assignments that work like classical puzzles are just awful. Puzzle games that give you a bit more freedom are still fun though (e.g. anything by Zachtronic :P). I think this freedom is essential for learning programming - the fact that 10 people can solve the problem 10 different ways and they're correct.,2018-05-19T07:49:32.207,1816
12591,4791,1,I've made a list of games of progressively increasing complexity that I wanted to make when I was a kid and it was great fun to follow that. There's so many ways to get from simple to complex and so many things you can tinker with in even the very simple games... Today for projects like this there's essentially no CPU/RAM limit - you can just keep tinkering and learning more experiences about the things that don't quite scale well etc. You can reuse loads of the work you've already done experiment with so many ways to make things more awesome...,2018-05-19T07:54:30.580,1816
12592,4790,1,Many techno-religious debates are perpetrated by people who just like to argue. Or people who picked a side and now are looking for any opportunity for a political fight (destroy the enemy bring up your own side). You might see them as people who enjoy the process too much - I see them as people who don't enjoy the process. Otherwise they'd love to play around with the different approaches rather than arguing about them (*especially* in the unproductive my team is better than your team way). But definitely you must love the result at least as much as the process :),2018-05-19T08:04:10.760,1816
12593,4804,1,Just because you find something interesting or not doesn't mean other people do. It's a subjective thing. For most people I know seeing a little person move on the screen according to their input is far more interesting than dealing with the proper pattern of allocating memory. The latter might come later as they master the high level concepts or it might not. I love digging both ways - all the way from understanding the electronics (and building my own CPU from TTL chips) to playing around with lambda calculus. Each of these interests came at its own time they weren't pre-existent.,2018-05-19T08:10:11.490,1816

12598,4808,1,Nice answer and welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2018-05-19T12:55:14.123,27
12599,4791,0,_@Luaan Hmm. I am nineteen so never really had the troubles of low memory. I am using computer literally from the time I could walk but I honestly don't remember what I did on a computer then but it surely wasn't coding. My first Laptop had 2GB of RAM and a 512MB graphic card. But I agree it is fun tinkering with old projects. Though most of my code prior to 2015 is redundant. I had never heard of complexity or clean code then so I essentially most of my games used direct methods instead of optimal ones.,2018-05-19T19:30:22.290,5224
12600,4786,0,_@Luaan I suppose that makes sense. How do you feel about math though?,2018-05-19T22:44:21.553,5105
12601,4783,1,To highlight DP's point one only needs to visit codegolf.SE,2018-05-20T00:28:58.863,1607
12602,4785,0,You could also quite easily make your own at-home version of Ludum Dare. Pick a weekend -- ideally one _without_ school -- sit down and make a game.,2018-05-20T00:30:19.777,2655
12603,655,0,It *is* cute.  But aside from the fact that it's not really correct as already noted it really describes a recursive data structure.  Now recursive programs are naturally used to process recursive data structures.  But in my experience recursive definitions of recursive data structures are even more magical and mysterious to students than recursive functions are.  Of course once you get the idea you realize how natural and powerful this all becomes.  But for undergraduates from what I've seen it's extremely sophisticated.,2018-05-20T02:10:23.340,5258
12604,4791,1,I've learned not to tell people their code is suboptimal while they're still having fun - that just tends to make them annoyed (and bored). The best place to explain about deduplication abstraction etc. is when they already have a codebase that suffers from not having those things - at that point it's a solution to their (growing) problem rather than an annoyance. Lately I've been having problems with doing too much abstraction and planning in my home projects and they suffer immensely - returning to a more straight approach helped me focus on having fun making games :),2018-05-20T06:52:44.317,1816
12605,4786,0,For the most part I see it as an essential tool. I did have lots of fun with some disciplines though and I usually tend to go the way of understanding the ideas rather than trying to remember formulas/algorithms. But I learn everything that way I avoid memorising whenever I can :D So e.g. when I need to do division on paper I don't remember the process they taught us - but it takes me just a minute or two to reconstruct it based on what I know about numbers. I can't even remember the volume of a sphere off the top of my head but I can do integrals so it takes about 5s to get there :D,2018-05-20T06:57:22.700,1816

12610,4789,1,_@Luaan Sure - if it really does float your boat then cool. But the OP is wondering why his son can't get into it and sees it just as work. For me that says the kid needs a target which will make it fun.,2018-05-20T19:40:02.340,1864
12611,4786,1,_@Luaan Sometimes I say programming is like math but you have the freedom and the power to make variables equal whatever you want.,2018-05-21T02:13:35.467,5105

12631,4789,2,I'd argue that you are fundamentally wrong. The concept of intrinsic motivation is basically about doing things *'for the sake of themselves'*. Studies have shown intrincally motivated people delivering way better results than extrinsically motivated people. Therefor neglecting the fun of it ist most probably the wrong way.,2018-05-22T09:30:33.057,5280
12633,4789,0,_@PaulKertscher Then your opinion is that the OP's son should drop programming because he will never get good results right? The OP's son is clearly *not* intrinsically motivated right now so he needs some way to find it fun. Intrinsic motivation is by definition intrinsic to the person so you can't change that. It's not neglecting the fun it's recognising that for this person *it is not fun*. Studies have shown that *teaching* with a way of applying what you've learnt delivers way better results and a fun application gets you past this.,2018-05-22T09:56:48.777,1864
12634,4789,0,_@Graham No I'm not saying that at least I did not intend it but I see how my can be read that way. I was reading your statement *You are not supposed to enjoy programming* as a general statement reducing programming to a tool and denying that there is a benefit in enjoying it. Anyway for the specific situation of the OP I see that it might be useful concentrating on the results rather than the process.,2018-05-22T10:06:44.160,5280

12680,4837,0,University professorship sounds like a dream with some constraints whereas companies in industry sound more like a lot of constraints with some nice stuff. As Arts&M??tiers is really close to where I live I will probably try to attend a meeting there if there is one in the near future thanks for the advice I didn't know this organization :),2018-05-27T22:24:55.843,5308
12681,4837,1,It is one of the top Engineering schools in France. You are lucky to be close. I don't however really know if they have what you are looking for but can probably provide direction. Good luck in your searches.,2018-05-27T22:54:16.957,1293
12682,202,0,Sorry I no longer have access. In general I can tell you the error exercises usually involved an error related to what they'd just learned.,2018-05-28T06:59:53.937,65
12683,4842,0,At the times the feedback loop (punch-cards / submit / get the result) was so slow that tracing examples by hand was seen as a viable option for the debugging even for complicated programs. And trying the modified version. Took lot of time but was faster than wasting the next compilation batch for remaining stupid mistakes.,2018-05-28T09:19:05.673,2103
12684,4842,0,At the risk of sounding like the old guy reminiscing about the good old days that were not really so good => Hand check the program before running it. https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/alfredth/2007/06/22/programming-proverbs-21-hand-check-the-program-before-running-it/,2018-05-28T09:23:04.330,2103
12685,437,0,_@EllenSpertus there is research to the effect that the presence of a woman on a team improves the team performance. However there is also research evidence that if a woman is the only woman on a team she will be unhappy. Sorry but I can't remember the source. I likely heard of it at either SIGCSE or one of the Agile conferences. The lesson that I generalize is that diversity is good and isolation is bad.,2018-05-28T12:41:49.833,1293
12687,4842,0,_@MichelBillaud yes how painful it was. Though I also seem to remember that _desk checking_ was something we recommended to students but didn't actually do ourselves. We were infallible of course or thought it to be so. ;-),2018-05-29T12:50:31.123,1293
12688,4842,0,Actually unit test does the job,2018-05-29T16:42:27.380,2103
12689,4847,0,This doesn't seem to be about CS education at all... Am I mistaken?,2018-05-29T20:57:13.087,150
12690,4847,0,This is about how best to teach and explain a CS concept...,2018-05-29T21:11:42.963,3778
12691,4847,1,Would you mind adding some examples of the functions you're talking about? I also think @ItamarG3 may have been noticing that you seem to be asking for the concept to be explained to you and not to be asking for ways to teach a concept you already know. That's not necessarily a bad thing though.,2018-05-29T21:15:01.393,58
12692,4847,0,thanks! Here's the docs for the sphero; https://sphero.docsapp.io/docs/Production%2010-05-2017/12-advanced-concepts#keywords-async-and-await. It has some examples,2018-05-29T21:44:20.223,3778
12693,4779,0,You might be interested in scala a functional sibling to Java that compiles to the JVM.,2018-05-30T00:10:29.177,21
12694,4849,2,Hi Thobias! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! I'm interested in seeing what sorts of answers you get to this question. It think it may be a bit broad to be covered in a single answer but we'll see how it goes. If you're interested in discussing this question (or CS Education generally) feel free to stop by [our chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom).,2018-05-30T00:46:34.320,58
12695,4847,2,**JavaScript ??? Java _????????????_ !** In JavaScript **`void`** is not a __type__ it is an unary operator which evaluates to **`undefined`**. In addition **_every_** function in JavaScript returns _something_ even if that is **`undefined`**. An **`async`** function will *return* a **`Promise`** even if that function has a **`return`** statement in it which _returns_ a regular value. __So__ what is the real question/problem you need answered/addressed?,2018-05-30T02:57:07.840,104
12696,4849,0,Why would the pedagogical *methods* change when the subject changes? Of course the details of how to implement a method will vary between disciplines and instructors for that matter. Still methods that work for language instruction history medicine social sciences etc. should work just as well for Computer Science.,2018-05-30T06:12:22.590,104
12697,232,0,Pointers are (unfortunately for beginners) a must-have in early stage of C teaching as you certainly want the students to use a procedural approach for programming (decomposition of actions as small functions thus transmitting parameters by copy and by reference).,2018-05-30T07:15:15.137,2103
12698,4849,0,I do think learning & teaching in IT differs drastically from other sciences/languages.  Especially concerning available tools finding help access possibilities and the advantage of IT to directly see an impact (Hello World etc).,2018-05-30T08:39:56.517,1761
12699,4849,1,Also it is very easy to educate yourself in IT / play around with things. Playing around with (e.g.) the russian alphabet probably does not have a lot of educational value.,2018-05-30T08:51:26.977,1761
12700,4849,0,Agree with @Cribber. Computer programming is about learning how to solve problems down to very precise details. Learning specific syntax grammar of programming langages is < 1% of the difficulty so there's very little analogy to do with learning a foreign language the culture of the country and its literature.,2018-05-30T08:54:46.637,2103
12701,4847,0,I've thought about this question a bit more and it really seems like a programming question rather than a teaching question. That's why I've voted to close as off-topic. If it is a teaching question please [edit] it to clarify. If not you might have better luck asking on Stack Overflow.,2018-05-30T11:16:51.753,58
12702,232,0,_@MichelBillaud yes I consider it a big downside of C. I personally started from Pascal and therefore when being beginner I had by-ref-parameters without pointers. Maybe it's better to start learning C without by-ref parameters (i.e. pass in by copy pass out through result or through a member of result structure) in the beginning?,2018-05-30T12:40:59.783,216
12703,104,0,See this answer (https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/4852/1293) to a related question. It may offer some insight into this as well.,2018-05-30T12:46:29.183,1293
12704,232,1,_@Sasha Maybe it's better to learn the basics of programming with a more civilized language and keep C for occasions where you really need low level stuff for efficiency (which drastically excludes transmitting copies of things when not necessary). C as a first language defeats its own purpose.,2018-05-30T13:09:46.053,2103
12705,4847,2,A function that has no return value is not a function. It is a procedure. However the `C` family (C C++ Java C# JS ;..) of languages call them all functions by mistake. A good was to distinguish is with good names. Verb phrases for procedures (no-return) adjectives if returning boolean nouns if returning something else. Not foolproof as any fool can use bad names.,2018-05-30T14:50:25.717,204
12706,4849,0,_@thesecretmaster I will thank you very much. I loved all the answers thank you very much. I think I have finally found my place in CS! LOL. I have been wondering about this for quite a while.,2018-05-30T15:39:23.377,5318
12708,4851,0,That is the closest answer to what I was asking. Not yet what I was looking for but very close. I'll wait a bit. If No one else provides with formal academic teaching paths I will mark this one for being straight to the answer. So far I believe there is none in CS. Which is a bit sad since there are so many people teaching CP and there is no work (to my knowledge) that talks about the subject Teaching Computer Programming. Thank you so much!,2018-05-30T16:02:50.340,5318
12709,4853,0,Thank you for such a detailed explanation. But if there is any confusion to what I asked I may edit. But English teaching methods is in the question just to demonstrate teaching methods we use and not really a comparison to how teaching methods work in CS(or any with CS). I just wanted to know if you guys had such a thing. Or perhaps work with pedagogical theory oriented goal (ex:different goals for different groups according to their realities). But very interesting what you said. I will look for it. Thank you. I was looking for something like @Cribber's answer.,2018-05-30T16:19:23.763,5318
12710,4851,0,And just to be clear. Those are methods of teaching you are using. I just wanted to know if there are any main one like stated in the question. Again thank you!,2018-05-30T16:28:40.867,5318
12711,4851,0,I find that the methods given here are re-framed versions of what the OP originally gave as examples. Frontal here is Communicative above Collaborative and Project based are either Immersion or NLP above depending on how guided the programming is. Guide-and-release and Free Style are more 'mentoring' than teaching similar the the 'adviser' for a Master's Thesis than an instructor in a classroom.,2018-05-30T16:53:50.337,104
12712,4849,0,I don't think that Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a method of foreign language instruction in any context.  Perhaps you have confused some terms?  NLP is a very specific (and now largely debunked) system of influencing mind and thinking created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder.,2018-05-30T20:23:52.497,27
12713,4849,0,No I haven't. It is widely used to teach languages. Look at Wizard institution of Language teaching and IBL. There are other famous ones that use NLP as a way to teach languages. There is the BBC resources for Language learning that explains some key features. https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/neuro-linguistic-programming-elt. I hope you enjoy @BenI.,2018-05-30T21:54:37.040,5318
12714,4851,0,_@GypsySpellweaver Actually I could only relate to lang. teaching above are Guide-and-Release Project based and Free Style since they seem to be student centered and not teacher centered methods. Maybe due to my oversimplification of the post it may have seemed otherwise. The other methods described seems to be teacher centered teaching. Which is opposed to all the methods I mentioned. But there are others that are teaching centered methods of education. For more -> https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/which-is-best-teacher-centered-or-student-centered-education/,2018-05-30T22:15:52.930,5318
12716,4849,0,_@ThobiasCerqueira Utterly fascinating! I studied NLP for years ignoring many of the strongest (and weirdest!) claims by its gurus and got a ton out of it. Those pseudoscientific claims seemed to sink the whole thing for most people but some of the core principles have really stuck with me over the years. I'm glad to see that some of the simpler more straightforward aspects are still being put to good use. Thanks for sharing that!,2018-05-31T03:27:57.823,27
12717,4847,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I know that async methods return promises but promises don't count as true return methods. This is the concept I am struggling to explain- if you look at the docs here; https://sphero.docsapp.io/docs/12-advanced-concepts#keywords-async-and-await you can see that it says you can't return values with async functions and you shouldn't use them with it. What is the distinction and how can I explain it?,2018-05-31T04:07:52.407,3778
12718,4847,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor the unfortunate thing is in JS as far as I can tell all methods are called functions? so where is the distinction? I want to help students create async functions with Sphero and want to make a clear distinction. What is that distinction?,2018-05-31T04:08:41.823,3778
12719,4855,0,An interesting challenge. Let's see what folks come up with :),2018-05-31T05:30:23.153,27
12720,4855,0,Don't use _shortcuts_ until you _know_ what they mean. `chmod 0760 <file>` is quite explicit and unambiguous. Once you _know_ what's being done with that way then and only then should you be willing to trust yourself to use `chmod u+xo-r <file>`.,2018-05-31T05:40:55.123,104
12721,4847,0,That distinction is a red herring: it does not exist. To repeat: _ALL_ functions (methods) in JS _return_ something whether or not the programmer tells it to and whether or not the caller uses it. The docs are not 100% correct: Point #2 is advice not compiler law Point #3's title does not match its text. A compile error is given when `await` is used inside a function not declared `async` but an `async` function can return a value and be valid to the compiler.,2018-05-31T05:47:47.800,104
12722,4849,0,_@BenI. You are welcome. I'm glad I was able to provide that insight. I know what you mean with the pseudocientific approach. I have see a ton of them too. I hope this info provide a different insight to teaching approach with that tool.,2018-05-31T11:38:47.680,5318
12723,4854,1,Thank you! This is what I was looking for. I will do some heavy research on it and thank you for being straight to the question and pointing out a method of teaching that works for teaching how to program based on a studied pedagogical principle. How you put it adapted and used to coding seems VERY good to me. Again Thank you!,2018-05-31T11:47:31.750,5318
12724,4855,2,_@GypsySpellweaver only that it is **not** a shortcut but **feature** of the command that is **EXTREMELY** cumbersome to emulate using octal codes.,2018-05-31T13:48:22.207,5326
12725,4847,0,_@GypsySpellweaver Depends whether you are talking about computer science education or job training.  If you're talking about computer science then procedure and function have accepted meanings independent of any particular programming language.,2018-05-31T16:09:36.873,1269
12726,4847,0,_@jameslarge The fact that procedure and function have a distinct and separate meaning in computer science is why the distinction is a red herring in JavaScript. JavaScript does not implement procedures _everything_ is a function and will always return _something_ even if nothing is specified or if the return value is disregarded. The programmer can code it like a procedure and call it like a procedure but in JS it is still a function.,2018-05-31T17:17:19.770,104
12727,4855,0,@GypsySpellweaver - but if all you want to do is change one permission bit (as the example shows with `chmod o+w`) there is no way to do that using what I call the numeric method of stating permissions.  I do test my students on them mention that they most often appear that way in documentation etc. I also teach them the `u=rwxg=rxo=` way of setting them which is equivalent to the numeric method.  Some folks remember letters better - some folks remember numbers better.  I do my best to teach all of the different ways.,2018-06-01T01:22:18.703,662
12728,89,0,The example you give is finding logical errors.  Basic syntax will get syntax errors which the compiler/interpreter should catch.  Not so with logical errors.  And mixing up `=` vs `==` will lead to logical errors because it almost always evaluates to `true` - as in  why yes this value can be or just has been assigned to that variable.  So... test on debugging code.  Both syntax errors and logic errors. Add in testing for edge cases and you are part way on to teaching how to create unit tests :),2018-06-01T01:26:59.703,662
12729,1299,2,Finally realizing that f of x *was* a function - just like I was used to in programming - got me through algebra.  This is what happens when you learn to program long before you get past long division using paper and pencil. I've come to think that math is a rather poor programming language with nondescriptive variables no logic confusing syntax for loops and no `man` pages. :),2018-06-01T01:30:15.643,662
12730,4855,0,Actually the letter x means eXecute for files only. And cross for directories. So the whole thing is misleading. So the better thing to do is to _learn_ the exact meaning of the letters in the various contexts instead of trying to guess.  Same thing for the short options names of basic unix commands.,2018-06-01T14:10:47.017,2103
12731,4857,1,This is a very clear explanation of the overall topic but the question was about how to help students remember that the owner from `chown` does not refer to the `o` in `chmod` but rather to the `u`.  How would you do that?,2018-06-01T14:19:08.970,27
12732,4857,0,Unix has the concept of file ownership.  All files are owned by some user or they are owned by root.  Owners then set permissions for their files as they see fit.  All files in your home directory you create belong to you.,2018-06-01T15:26:15.293,21
12733,4858,2,This is a perfect question. Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2018-06-01T22:46:28.357,27
12734,4858,1,It would also be good if you would register for the site so you can become more a part of the conversation here.,2018-06-01T23:25:14.037,1293
12739,1106,0,Sadly @thesecretmaster may be correct. We are teaching pupils to be consumers (one of the most damaging words in modern life). Or worse in most cases to be the product. Better to be free and teach others to be free.,2018-06-02T10:55:50.483,204
12740,4855,0,_@GypsySpellweaver you sound like von neumann: Assembly language is for the feeble minded real programmers use machine code.,2018-06-02T11:10:42.393,204
12742,4855,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I must be super feeble minded since I don't even like Assembly though I've done machine and Assembly. The layers of abstraction available in 3rd gen(+) langs is wonderful. In this case however if one way is confusing use the other which while less simple less confusing.,2018-06-02T17:57:53.157,104
12750,4856,0,So in other words teach **chown = change owner*ship***?,2018-06-04T10:56:40.827,1219
12751,4864,3,Welcome to CSEducators. Could you edit your question to add a reference to the book? Also _building_ a chatbot and _using_ a chatbot seem to be two quite different things.,2018-06-04T14:20:15.153,1293
12752,4864,0,This strikes me as far too broad. There are too many questions there and I'm not sure if the question is even about teaching CS any more than simply building a chatbot. Can you please edit to clarify?,2018-06-04T21:12:20.507,58
12753,4867,1,I've downvoted because of the lack of context. Optimization is a fairly broad topic so any qualifiers you could add or any indications of textbooks you've looked at would be super hepful.,2018-06-04T22:43:16.300,58
12755,4867,1,_@Buffy Thanks for the reply! I am more interested in algorithm optimization techniques.,2018-06-04T23:55:46.017,5344
12758,4867,2,_@velutluna Add that information into the question and hopefully a bunch more information into the question as well and you will find that your downvotes disappear :) The question is topical it just needs more information. Also welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2018-06-05T04:05:28.933,27
12760,4864,0,CS is the study of computers (sort of) where as you are asking about using computers as a study aid. These are not the same think (Use of a computer in the classroom is not necessarily computer science and computer science does not necessarily use computers).,2018-06-05T12:25:11.593,204
12762,4867,0,Is this a self-learning question or are you trying to find something to use with your students?,2018-06-05T17:06:20.873,27
12763,4867,0,I am a student. It is for self-learning.,2018-06-06T00:40:29.307,5344
12764,215,1,The problem with this is that while they are numbered 0 1 and so on the floor with number one is also called the first floor (at least in Germany and other European countries I know of) while in an array the first element is not indexed with 1.,2018-06-06T14:29:51.450,3335
12765,4870,0,Adding more specifics about what you want to learn/be able to do would be very helpful. If you're question is simply How can I learn everything that seems far too broad to be answered in a single answer.,2018-06-08T10:25:16.207,58
12766,4870,1,Yes your question is too broad. Computer Science and Electronics is an incredibly broad range. You need to narrow it down. The best way to do that is to find a person perhaps at a local school or university who is already an expert and explore with her/him your goals. Imagine that you are entering a vast jungle about which you know nothing. You would be wise to find a guide first. The reason that a university education is valuable (from a learning standpoint) is that others who do understand the goals and how to achieve them can help you with your own goals.,2018-06-08T12:06:43.693,1293
12767,4870,2,I fear that this question here will result in so many options that you can't possibly follow them and you will have nothing better than random advice. And expect mastery of even a small part of the landscape to take a long time to achieve. Ten years? More? The best time to plant a tree is 40 years ago. The second best time is now but it won't seem like a tree for quite a while.,2018-06-08T12:09:36.083,1293
12768,4870,2,What level experience do you have (you say no degree but do you have other experience qualifications)? What are you main goals? I will vote to put on hold but will be happy to re-open if you add the specific things asked for.,2018-06-08T15:29:57.653,204
12769,4871,0,Hardware is somewhat less important than it was 40 years ago. Amateur Radio is similarly less relevant nowadays.,2018-06-09T21:25:56.440,1536
12770,4871,0,_@YuvalFilmus but if the OP wants to learn about computers and electronics then hardware is pretty important. And since Amateurs do much of the experimental programming and hardware design I think they are just as relevant as they were in Edwin Howard Armstrong's day. 750000 hams in the US twice as many in Japan and millions more throughout the world would probably disagree with you.,2018-06-09T23:52:50.423,5349
12772,4868,0,Actually Donald Knuth warned about worrying about optimization prematurely. When you develop an algorithm without much concern for optimization you are proving whether your requirements are valid. Once you've done that you can do tests that prove if optimization is even something you need to consider. Stick with readable code and you can make it as fast as you need to at any time. Sacrifice readable code chasing optimization and if it turns out you need to change it you can't because you can't read it.,2018-06-10T13:32:47.873,1401
12773,4868,0,_@candied_orange actually Knuth was speaking more generally of programming not specifically what we have come to recognize as algorithms in what we call The Algorithms and Data Structures course. In fact though it was Tony Hoare who said Premature optimization is the root of all evil. The idea is that most programs are sufficiently fast that you are wasting time on optimizing them initially. First run a profiler on the program to see where it is spending resources and then optimize those parts if necessary. I interpret the question here more narrowly however.,2018-06-10T13:49:07.513,1293
12774,4789,0,I think I understand what you're trying to say. We want features not code. However I've seen to many programs that recognize palindromes whose source was itself a palindrome. Maybe I'm not supposed to enjoy programming but I do anyway. I don't think I'm alone.,2018-06-10T13:50:34.023,1401
12775,4868,0,On the other hand Knuth did say Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct not tried it. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth. Also see https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/C._A._R._Hoare,2018-06-10T13:55:50.027,1293
12776,4868,0,Hehe I've said [something similar](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/315968/131624): I write and run tests that prove it works before I suspect it works.,2018-06-10T13:58:35.737,1401
12777,4868,0,Of course you're free to interpret the question as you like. I'm simply advocating that one of the less theoretical algorithm optimization techniques is to just write something simple and readable that meets the requirements first before you give in to making things all weird in the name of speed. That way as you iterate on the problem you only pick up the weirdness you really need.,2018-06-10T14:04:04.583,1401
12779,4816,0,My favorite way to answer this question is: Older. I've been a successful code monkey for decades in many different fields and I still don't know what I want to be. And of course many people would debate whether I've grown up.,2018-06-10T14:31:32.107,1401
12780,4870,0,I think you should grab a raspberry pi and build you're own Robot or home automation system you would be able to learn a lot in the process : Shell C automation basic electronics python node.js. When you'll have the project done you'll have get through a lot of the main basics of programming embedded systems web and electronics subjects. But to truly progress you should not only follow tutorials but also try to understand stuff and mess around.,2018-06-11T10:15:28.673,4900

12794,4884,0,OK well I might be ignorant about the particulars of Markov Chains having read about them 30 years ago so that is fine. But some sort of weighted prediction (more like a tree) is obviously being used to drive the keyboard thing because I can often type an entire text message just by picking one of the three suggestions for next word on my phone. Pretty good prediction if you ask me! (Have you used that feature?) The frustrating thing is how the options move position as I type so I am reaching for the leftmost one and by the time I touch there it has moved to the center position. Ugh!,2018-06-13T18:31:07.483,5349
12795,4883,0,_@Buffy Thanks for locating the article and putting it in the question!,2018-06-13T18:36:15.310,5349

12798,4882,0,I like this answer though you sort of skirted past the confusion that wolf-revo-cats asked about which is the somewhat odd mismatch between `chown` and `chmod o...`.  Would you then say that `chown` should have been `chusr`?  Or more to the point how would you get folks new to the unix model to avoid getting confused here in the first place?,2018-06-14T12:18:20.580,27

12806,4882,0,Done. I'm fairly new here; do the comments get wiped automatically or is that done manually?,2018-06-14T20:52:14.427,1336
12807,4882,0,It's normally done manually but the central idea of SE is to create really high quality questions and answers that help future visitors. The comment tool is really just meant to provide an avenue to help improve questions or answers.  The answer should still ultimately end up in the answer :),2018-06-14T20:58:55.730,27
12808,4884,0,Scott the same thing happens to me!  My fingers aren't fast enough.  Usually the data structure used for predictive typing is a TRIE - here's one article on how to do it in Javascript: [link] (https://medium.com/@dookpham/predictive-text-autocomplete-using-a-trie-prefix-tree-data-structure-in-javascript-part-1-6ff7fa83c74b),2018-06-15T13:44:06.147,4338
12811,4613,0,Are you asking for big data sets or for the tools. I heard of some organisation that has collected some big data sets for educators. Can't remember who. I am in UK I was at a CAS meeting in Guildford (that may be where I heard it maybe).,2018-06-16T10:05:16.130,204
12812,4887,1,I don't understand what the third point has to do with puzzles. Project Euler has great puzzles for instance but they are language-agnostic.,2018-06-16T10:45:04.587,27
12813,4887,1,I'm guessing that you mean but don't say you want programs for puzzles where a human user is currently the solver but that might be amenable to replacing that with an automated or AI solver instead. If that is correct you might stress it more in the question.,2018-06-16T10:59:05.320,1293
12814,4887,0,This strikes me as too broad because there's no actual question here or problem to be solved. You're asking for a list of games that fit your criteria. Questions that ask for lists aren't a good fit for the Stack Exchange Q&A format because there's no real question and there's no way to judge the best answer so voting fails to be useful. This question could be improved by adding what you want to use these games _for_ giving us the larger context that you'll be using these games in.,2018-06-16T13:10:32.283,58
12817,4887,0,_@thesecretmaster yes it may be a list question but I think it can work. It is bounded. Only **implementations** that fit the **criteria**. My hope is no find one or two collections.,2018-06-16T14:06:40.890,204

12850,4891,1,I believe that this question should be closed as too broad. From the help center: Avoid asking subjective questions where ... you are asking an open-ended hypothetical question and You should only ask practical answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. To narrow it down you could add information about _why_ you want to know this and how it relates to your teaching.,2018-06-18T17:58:59.363,58
12851,4893,1,I've downvoted this answer because looking 'professional' while typing shouldn't be a prerequisite to learning CS. Maybe for the workplace but not for a classroom.,2018-06-18T18:06:31.763,58
12852,4893,1,Your first two paragraphs seem inconsistent. Do you really mean to say that you wouldn't let a person start CS until they demonstrate somehow that they are competent in typing? That seems too extreme for me and a good way to assure small classes and frustrated (non) students.  I doubt that even Language Arts would make that requirement.,2018-06-18T18:10:46.197,1293
12853,4891,4,I agree that the question can be improved as above but not that it should be closed. Sometimes a question that seems simple turns out not to be - here and in the classroom.,2018-06-18T18:14:24.403,1293
12855,4891,0,Please refrain from using the comments to talk about your experiance with typing. Comments are for suggesting improvments to the question not discussion of it or answers. Answers in comments or discussion of your experiance learning to type will be deleted.,2018-06-18T18:28:30.733,58
12856,4893,1,Being unable to type and look at the screen at the same time is a pretty big disadvantage.  If I was teaching a college level computer science course I would want students to be prepared.  Perhaps I wouldn't have it as a pre-requisite but would instead paint over the alphabetic keys of all the keyboards?  The point is they should have it eventually and therefore might as well be practicing while working in their other CS classes.,2018-06-18T19:58:15.603,1399
12857,4893,3,_@BillK hmmm. The beatings will continue until morale improves. Right?,2018-06-18T20:08:56.110,1293
12858,4893,3,I taught college level CS for over 40 years and never once found typing ability to be an issue. However if I wanted students to do something that they weren't used to I'd look for some _positive_ inducement to get them to do it **not** a way to increase their frustrations. If my relationship with them was good (and it was) a simple suggestion in the hallway might be enough. But you get that good relationship by supporting the students even when they do sub-optimal things. Frustrating them will make them hate me as well as the subject I suspect. I would have no future influence with them.,2018-06-18T20:22:48.883,1293
12859,4893,0,However to be fair I generally agree with the first paragraph of your answer. Typing skills are _helpful_. But so are editing/refactoring skills and thinking skills and interpersonal skills and ...,2018-06-18T20:27:32.970,1293
12861,4895,1,Welcome to CSEducators. I'm guessing that your experience is pretty common in the US at least. When I was a kid typing was pretty unusual as a course - for boys anyway.,2018-06-18T23:46:09.083,1293
12862,4892,0,This answer would be improved by more clearly differentiating between _touch typing_ and _homerow_. Typing without looking at the keyboard has nothing to do with how many fingers touch the keys.,2018-06-19T05:31:51.730,5382
12863,3241,0,In real life (business) there is always a tradeoff between time/cost/difficulty of implementation+maintenance and the benefit of a solution. For this reason it is not the case that the most algorithmically efficient way to solve a problem is always required nor necessarily the best for a given problem.,2018-06-19T07:38:39.800,1090
12864,4895,2,There is another advantage: smaller error rate: you catch typos faster if you are looking at the screen rather than at the keyboard. I don't know if you lump that together with efficiency but in my view it's a huge time-saver. Those typos often become time-consuming bugs to hunt.,2018-06-19T07:46:45.750,1658
12866,4897,0,Welcome to CSEducators. Can you document the claim in the second paragraph for future readers?,2018-06-19T10:02:47.140,1293
12870,4895,0,_@Buffy That's a good point that my experience may be reasonably unique to the US but is kind of orthogonal to the point I was trying to make.,2018-06-19T11:52:13.093,2523
12871,4897,0,The cited paper seems to be about something completely different - shoulder surfing,2018-06-19T11:52:27.100,1293
12872,4897,6,_@Buffy: If by *document* you mean *provide evidence* I have nothing than my own experience to offer (except for the fact that touch typing relies on muscle memory which seems to be generally accepted). A few similar claims can be found on the Internet but they are not very trustworthy.,2018-06-19T11:52:49.540,25
12873,4897,0,I'd be surprised it it hasn't had some research applied to it. If the claims are not trustworthy where does that leave us. My suspicion too is that it is a correct observation but gut feeling isn't the same as research. As it stands it is just opinion.,2018-06-19T11:54:39.653,1293
12876,4893,0,_@ScottRowe actually you _don't_ have to finish by graduation. If a student never learns anything after they end their formal education you have failed as a teacher. Giving them good mental habits and an enquiring mind will carry them further than any technical idea. But starting early is good I agree.,2018-06-19T12:22:01.513,1293
12878,4893,0,_@Buffy it comes down to defining the goal and there are differing views on that. We are probably looking at the same thing from opposite sides.,2018-06-19T12:26:05.300,5349
12885,4901,1,In your first four paragraphs you make some claims. Perhaps they are widely held but perhaps they are just opinions. Can you point to any research to back them up? It would make your argument stronger of course.,2018-06-19T19:11:50.287,1293
12887,4897,0,_@Buffy: 1)??See my edit. 2)??Regarding the trustworthiness of the claims I should have written that the sources are not trustworthy. 3)??*As it stands it is just opinion.* ?€???Yes.,2018-06-19T19:22:40.890,25
12896,4892,2,Don't forget chat software and e-mails.,2018-06-19T21:07:12.270,981
12897,4897,3,_@Buffy Evidence of _what_ is still a question but there has been some research done on the subject. The published paper is [pay-walled](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-49569-001/). It is discussed however in an [article](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2016/10/18/todays-self-taught-typists-almost-as-fast-as-touch-typistsas-long-as-they-can-see-the-keyboard/) from Research News @ Vanderbilt.,2018-06-19T21:07:34.850,104
12899,4902,34,A forcefully stated opinion at least. And if you are a business owner you can hire whom you like i guess. But this says This is TRUE because I DEMAND that it is true. More forceful than convincing. And yes even in academia I've typed thousands of lines of code (per day) and thousands of lines of tests. I am a touch typist however but don't attribute my success to that. Some of your statements above may be supportable but none are supported by what you say actually.,2018-06-19T22:19:28.390,1293
12901,4902,2,_@Buffy Again my intention is not to insult or disparage people. It's to make clear how fundamental the skill is to being an effective engineer. I think I've included valid reasons why it's important. Your own experience supports my answer (writing thousands of LOC). I don't think we would be doing any students any good by telling them proper typing skills aren't required to be effective which is what the top answers seem to suggest.,2018-06-19T22:43:35.053,5392
12902,4902,37,Actually you don't give _any_ reasons. Just opinion. Read it critically. If there is research cite it. Your firmly held beliefs however aren't reasons and certainly not proof.,2018-06-19T22:47:55.633,1293
12910,4897,0,_@GypsySpellweaver: Thanks for the reference. Sadly the research (as reported in Research News) doesn?€?t go to the interesting part: They compare touch typists and others when benchmarking pure typing skills in an unrealistic manner. They also report that touch typists become slower when composing a message (no surprise here). But they do not compare touch typists and others when composing a message.,2018-06-20T05:50:24.603,25
12913,4902,14,In your answer you seem to use interchangeably programmer and software engineer. They're not. You also seem to imply all CS students become either one or the other. That's false. You explicitely state that all CS students will have to write thousands of lines of code during their career. That's false. Also that they will have to do it under a deadline. That's false. You seem to imply using a whiteboard is only for academia and not real world. That's false (I've known a  *rockstar tech lead/project manager* in a very real private company who uses whiteboards and kanban *exclusively*),2018-06-20T08:53:21.373,994

12922,4902,14,You state that since there are many lines of code to write touch typing should be a requirement. However you haven't shown any sort of proof that touch typing is actually the fastest way. I've met plenty of programmers who can type *very fast* and *very accurately* even if they're not touch typists. If someone can effectively write large amounts of error-free code why would it matter if they're looking at their hands while doing so?,2018-06-20T13:15:31.300,5071
12924,4908,0,Testing knowledge is necessarily different from workplace activity. What if college graduation required successful workplace activity for one year? What if college (and High School) consisted of learning and becoming proficient in one or more workplaces - like Internships? This is called Apprenticeship. Used to work just fine...,2018-06-20T13:30:46.253,5349
12925,4892,1,_@Knetic The clraified question clearly asks for touch typing = nine finger typing which is almost always homerow typing. - Other interpretations could be watching the screen instead of your hands but are quite blurry and hard to test as a course requirement.,2018-06-20T13:56:10.587,5414
12926,4897,3,I just opened my IDE and started typing after 3 letters Intelli-Sense plopped up and I chose the right signature via two cursor down presses. - Programming with a modern IDE is more interacting with a document with mouse cursors and hotkeys instead of typing a lot of long words. - So touch-hot-keying and fast-document-navigation are probably more useful skills for muscle memory.,2018-06-20T13:58:59.720,5414
12928,4902,0,All I've incorporated feedback from your comments to try to improve the answer. I've relaxed the tone and tried to acknowledge the variety of CS jobs.

12935,4902,3,_@xDaizu Nowadays those terms are pretty interchangeable. Not many places hire code-monkeys anymore. Having only the ability to write code is not enough anymore like it was a few years ago (especially in the 90s and 2000s). You are right about CS students not being either though. In fact I think a very significant portion of CS grabs don't write code for a living.,2018-06-20T16:28:44.350,2719
12937,4908,0,_@ScottRowe There are in fact some colleges/universities that require internships and many others that strongly encourage them. The skills they learn from that are usually pretty good in my experience. For a good student it is also a nice path to later employment. Unfortunately unpaid internships are too often just a way to exploit young people. Especially if those unpaid internships _don't_ give good skills as some fail to do.,2018-06-20T16:40:37.937,1293

12953,4897,2,_@Wrzlprmft Motor memory also works for people who don't touch-type. I am a retired software engineer who worked in Silicon Valley industry and never learned how to touch type. I type with my middle fingers mostly but I don't have to hunt and peck. Rather I have to look down at the keyboard every other word or so the rest is motor memory as long as I keep using the same (or very similar) keyboard. My take is that touch typing is a nice-to-have skill but not required to be a successful software engineer. The few times I wished I could touch type was when cranking out lengthy documentation.,2018-06-21T02:00:27.903,1940

12976,4762,0,You need to teach them that names mean nothing. That includes disabusing them of the notion that names mean something. Names label things.,2018-06-21T21:20:58.297,2485
12977,4741,0,You have a limited notion of functional programming. Also ironically you give unnecessarily procedural semantics for Prolog. I agree the poster's fundamentists are misreading programs as programming.,2018-06-21T21:38:45.633,2485

12987,4762,0,_@philipxy can you elaborate? Are you saying that because the compile just sees the names as labels then so should we? This is a valid point of view but if we see it that way then we should act on our belief and use truly abstract sequential names and not think about them. `aaaaaaaa` `aaaaaaab` `aaaaaaac` etc.,2018-06-22T11:06:54.727,204
12989,4913,0,Yes I think the key to the question is whether to make something *required* and how. There seems to be a cultural bias (which I share) that we simply make the knowledge available and people undertake their own path through it. In other times and places it is more like: Learn all this perfectly and then you can decide for yourself once you have mastered it. It is wrong to not provide a path and expectations also wrong to force people to do things that they do not need. But we are not omniscient and things are changing fast so we don't know what is best. We all have opinions though...,2018-06-22T12:13:39.817,5349
12995,4762,0,Names are labels. In general we can infer nothing from the names of things. (This has nothing to do with implementation which has nothing to do with the meanings of programs.) In everyday life we are used to names frequently also being descriptive of their referents. But this cannot be relied on. Nor can it be in a technical context. All we can rely on is definitions axioms theorems & sound reasoning. Understanding this is fundamental to competent technical work. People must be actively disabused of their naive expectations. French toast is not toast. `=` is not equality if `not (NaN=NaN)`.,2018-06-22T19:13:11.333,2485
12996,4762,0,... Nevertheless mnemonic names are helpful. And memorability is with respect to the structure/organization of the system/metaphor they apply to. So poorly chosen collections of names are hard to remember. But this applies to all use not just learning.,2018-06-22T19:13:18.063,2485

13003,4762,0,It is not clear what you want to ask. Ok Would [beginner?] learning be improved if the language/libraries chose better names? isn't a case of how do we teach good naming. But it is true by definition of better & is a case of would use [by everyone] be improved if people chose better names?--also vacuous begging what is good naming? 4 (!) other phrases (title wondering if this is about & a comment) don't clarify how this is not vacuous or just a special case or how it is not actually what you mean to ask. Please replace the 5 by 1 clear question. And of what use is an answer?,2018-06-22T20:25:46.760,2485
13007,4897,1,With the advent of IDEs that you keep having to interact with this is much less of a factor than it used to be.  I do know in the old days I found it harder to program if I didn't have a suitable desk & chair that permitted touch typing--thinking about typing interferes with thinking about what you're writing.,2018-06-23T04:37:30.463,668
13009,4897,1,_@Falco Using mouse to control your computer is not very effective. Interrupted though process is big productivity loss (and there are studies for that). Of course I use mouse/touchpad too mostly to switch files but very rarely when editing a single file since using keyboard is so much more effective. After 20 years of using a computer I don't have to think about it at all.,2018-06-23T12:44:03.590,5449
13010,4897,0,_@Sulthan maybe that is the biggest difference I can not remember the last time I really wrote 50 lines of code at once sequentially in a single file... It is usually a few lines here a few lines there introducing a new variable or method writing long sequential code in a single file is a rarity for me,2018-06-23T12:50:35.340,5414
13012,4912,0,Just think what you could have accomplished if you could type faster?,2018-06-23T15:20:22.613,5349

13018,4907,0,Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79281/discussion-on-answer-by-ctrl-alt-delor-what-advantages-do-students-who-learn-how).,2018-06-24T05:08:47.007,58
13020,4902,4,In the real-world **coding is more thinking than typing** is completely true and to a greater degree than in undergraduate coursework.  That doesn't mean that you won't write thousands of lines of code (plus tests) but claiming that productivity of a programmer is solely dependent on how fast they type is just plain ridiculous.  Certainly typing skills are an advantage but that's because of the level of thinking involved -- when you have an idea you want to get it stored as quickly as possible before you start thinking about the next step.,2018-06-24T20:29:42.200,5163
13021,4902,3,In fact the value of fast typing is almost totally from improved speed of writing ideas down -- the increased speed of typing code is nice but ultimately unimportant.  So while I agree with your conclusion that acquiring touch-typing skills should be encouraged I can't upvote your answer due to the blatant wrong ideas you share along the way.,2018-06-24T20:30:21.027,5163
13022,4914,0,Actually your first experience was not pair programming. It was just two people assigned to one task. That isn't at all what pair programming is like. Division of labor is not one of the goals of pair programming and just as you say it often fails. It often fails in just the way you suggest. But it isn't an example of Pair Programming.,2018-06-24T22:55:14.900,1293
13023,4914,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. Input like this is quite useful to instructors trying to develop courses and classes that will help the students _learn_ the material not just get a grade. I certainly hope we see more of your input and experience on the site. Once you have 20 or more reputation points you can also join the conversation in [The Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) which is a chatroom dedicated to this site. It's often quiet but it can get lively when new questions show up or things get lively on the site.,2018-06-24T22:55:36.177,104
13024,4914,0,To add to my earlier comment: A common problem is technology generally and programming in particular is what happens when some successful methodology is widely adopted but adopted partially or badly without understanding. You hear things like X just doesn't work when in fact X wasn't really tried. There are many synergistic aspects of some things and when parts are omitted the synergy isn't there anymore. Your post is therefore really valuable though not as a criticism of Pair Programming. Division of Labor often fails to take into account that the work of two must be then integrated.,2018-06-25T00:04:12.667,1293
13025,4902,0,With the comments continually sniping on speed of typing while the answer doesn't actually say that I think part of it should be rewritten to explicitly state that efficiency isn't _just_ speed. I mentioned it in a prior comment that was removed but I think it's worth adding to the answer itself: The bigger issue is that when thinking about code you want as few context switches as possible. Usually this is framed as not being interrupted by another person but having to stop and think about the keyboard instead of the code is another type of context switching that has to be minimized.,2018-06-25T00:39:44.587,3262
13026,4902,4,Sorry I've know many programmers who were two-fingered typists. They were quite proficient typing 80 wpm.,2018-06-25T02:30:34.180,5397
13027,4902,0,_@kevincline Sounds like they are touch-typists just not home-row touch-typists.  They'd fall on the would hire side of this answer.,2018-06-25T03:55:30.160,3262
13028,4897,0,_@LorenPechtel: Actually interacting with IDEs makes it *more* necessary to type without looking at the keyboard (because you have to see what the IDE is suggesting on-screen),2018-06-25T04:27:43.037,5163
13029,4902,0,The disabled can be hired to program just fine without the ability to touch type.,2018-06-25T06:10:08.603,1364
13030,4902,1,_@James I agree with regards to being able to type without looking (much) at the keyboard but I think you should spell out the distinction in your answer between traditional proper touch-typing (using the home rows) and what I tend to call typing by touch which may use a style closer to hunt-and-peck but is still done without (much) looking at the keyboard and so is likely to be almost as fast as proper touch-typing.,2018-06-25T09:33:17.697,988
13032,4915,0,While not directly answering the question this answer does have a log of value. I suspect that the gap that it discusses is widened by the use of poor names. The more unlike their native language the wider the gap will be. Well written python with good name can look like english (may be any other language) but with strange punctuation.,2018-06-25T17:08:01.933,204
13033,4770,0,_@GypsySpellweaver should we likewise in literacy class give examples of poor punctuation spelling and grammar because they will see it in the real world.,2018-06-25T17:13:01.657,204
13034,4770,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor If you were teaching those who would become copy editors or that would have to deal professionally with updating/changing the work of others in that field then __yes__ you should. The experience and exposure will help them.,2018-06-25T17:54:29.623,104
13035,4770,0,_@GypsySpellweaver So should we give them this bad copy every lesson and tell them that this is best practice? Or some lessons where we ask them to correct it?,2018-06-25T18:04:14.967,204
13036,4770,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Once the course (back to CS) has covered best practice for naming and a library is used that does cause student confusion for lack of same then it becomes a _teaching moment_ to emphasise the why for using naming conventions as well as practice for sussing out what it's supposed to do despite the confusing name. Changing the past (rewriting a common library) is difficult to do. Teaching from past mistakes to create a better future is likely to be a more fruitful and efficient use of instructor energies.,2018-06-25T19:43:57.707,104
13037,4914,0,Interesting... I believe my first experience _was intended to be_ pair programming but I ended up being the driver and my partners were not skilled enough to be the driver or even the observer in most cases.  I ended up doing both the driving _and_ the observing (in hopes my partner would learn a thing or two).  It was not well explained but it was the intention for us to be Pair Programming.  In light of the bad explanation most students (myself included) took Pair Programming to mostly mean We only have to do half the work.,2018-06-26T00:24:47.270,5453
13038,4916,2,How much control over the setup for the room do you have? How much authority do you have for setting rules of conduct within the class? Do you have the ability (and permission) using your own skills or through the IT Dept. to customize the installations on the student workstations?,2018-06-26T02:18:35.620,104
13039,4916,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I can change the layout of the room to an extent. The limiting factor is the location of the floor outlets which are in rows along the floor. I'm stuck with windows as the workstation OS but I can request that custom software be installed by the IT Dept. However a request to install software could take a prohibitivly long time (think majority of a school-year).,2018-06-26T02:21:44.383,58
13040,4770,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I think we are in agreement. However I am not asking if I should re-write the libraries. I am asking if there is research on the effect (of using bad names in a beginner class: first lesson of programming). This will tell us what to do: What libraries to choose should we write a language/library for training/education. But I am not asking these questions here now.,2018-06-26T07:44:15.087,204
13041,4916,0,What is the class? Is it intro to programming or something broader or ...?,2018-06-26T09:44:45.390,1293

13044,4916,0,When I'm standing at the front of the room I am looking down rows. But when I am walking around the classroom I'll be walking through rows.,2018-06-26T10:52:35.533,58
13045,4916,0,Then isn't it pretty obvious when students aren't paying attention? Their shoulders would be to you rather than their faces? Or maybe you should face them more rather than back to them at the board. FWIW I don't like the general set up of one computer per student other than in lab sessions. Recessing the screens into the desks (expensive) gives everyone a more open view which is good but won't solve the problem.,2018-06-26T10:57:47.303,1293
13046,4897,0,_@BenVoigt You can look back and forth.  What I'm saying is that with a modern IDE you're not writing much code at once before having to interact with it anyway thus it's less of a disruption to have to think about the typing.,2018-06-26T17:55:10.717,668

13052,4068,0,Good answers here.

[Big O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) is the keyword you want to use when searching.,2018-07-03T10:55:44.153,2516
13054,4921,1,Isn't that an argument *for* starter code? There are so few opportunities within a broader curriculum to give students practice honing that skill and algorithms is one of the few places where it fits rather naturally no contortions required. After all it really does take practice to get decent at it. It is rather like stepping into someone else's brain.,2018-07-03T12:05:20.353,27
13055,4921,0,I'm not sure I agree with everything you say but it is well thought out and something to consider. Of course if you let them make mistakes you need other pedagogical tricks to catch them and focus on the mistakes. Likewise starter code needs to be well thought out for its overall effect and for where in the curriculum you use it. +1,2018-07-03T13:05:08.500,1293
13056,4921,0,I had an experience where the TA did not explain my mistake to me so it took a while to figure out but I never forgot that lesson! I try to find a balance between letting students discover their problems and having them waste time needlessly. I agree on the starter code. I think that it becomes something the students don't look at because they have their face pressed against the windshield trying to go faster and the more they overlook the less they learn. Writing the same boilerplate code several times is the only way to learn that stuff.,2018-07-03T14:52:02.023,5349

13060,4879,4,Just wanted to highlight this part: ...don't know how to start- in fact they don't even know what it's asking. Part of a class discussion could include breaking down the question as a group. As the question is broken down it will be easier for students to see paths to solutions. Then they can start to have discussions on how to write/construct the code for the answer.,2018-07-05T16:57:25.577,5476
13061,4921,0,_@BenI. I agree 100% about that being a benefit with starter code. But understanding someone else's code and learning an algorithm does seem a bit daunting for some students. Would it be more reasonable to say that it depends on the student or experience level? If the student is struggling just to understand the starter code then you can take a step back and try looking at the algorithm from scratch? Also - I hope I'm not breaking any rules by asking that question. If I was on StackOverflow it would be bordering on a discussion in the comments which is discouraged.,2018-07-05T18:22:31.210,5476

13072,4471,0,Pondering this one. Obviously in individual cases people overcome adversity and become great at things. But those cases are not the general template of education and the plural of Anecdote is not Employment. the way I deal with this is to simply see every student as an individual and every case as if it was the first time I had ever encountered it. I do not know how to generalize education perhaps from inadequate training. But I have lots of patience.,2018-07-10T16:48:36.027,5349

13085,4932,1,Why would you ever write a heapsort algorithm in a coding competition?

13088,4929,1,The return to nosql is by no means a given in industry. There is a trade-off between the ease of support for SQL solutions and the raw speed of many nosql solutions.

13093,4916,0,Does it particularly mater if the people in the class are not always paying attention to your lecture? If that is their choice let them reap what they sow. Taking personal responsibility and understanding consequences starts in adolescence but perhaps I'm assuming that the children in question aren't younger than high school aged. If you are worried about problem children bothering other potentially-interested children; splitting up the desks to discourage interaction is a good idea. Counter this with time where students can freely move around to help each other work on assignments.,2018-07-21T02:18:36.530,2847

13108,4946,0,It is vital to learn correct terms but what I observe is that another language might not have an exact correlate word but only a more general one. I find that English has taken many general words from other languages and made them highly specific. For example 'shampoo' is only for hair-washing in English but in the source language it just means 'soap'. Because many technical words arose in English-speaking contexts the correct exact match simply might not exist in another language.

13114,4917,0,True but. If it takes two hours to think through and solve the homework assignment taking one or ten minutes to type it up for hand in makes no significant difference.,2018-08-01T21:00:01.403,5219
13115,4893,0,_@Buffy I'm sure you are right and that's why I'm a programmer and not an educator.  I was using what had worked for me and trying to figure out a way to apply it to everyone--a pretty bad idea.,2018-08-01T21:34:30.650,1399

13120,4956,2,That was one of the points I learned doing GED with adults. They'd outgrown the adolescent inhibitions about seeming foolish and would ask why? Sometimes as much as a 5-yr-old.

13122,4570,0,Don't mix languages/paradigms for beginners! My experience (and others) is that learning the first language takes a year or so (a programming course then something like data structures or other more in-depth work) the second takes you half a year the next ones a few weeks. The first year is critical. And what they have to learn is the computer does as told not what is reasonable need to break down the task a variable isn't what a mathematician calls such. Hopefully the syntax and any mysterious overhead (the junk in Java's Hello world! for example) is reduced to a minimum.,2018-08-03T12:19:43.880,5219
13123,4571,0,Java is a complete mess (some types are objects and behave a certain way others aren't; you are playing with pointers to the objects and nobody says so) and has lots of mysterious stuff for the beginner that makes no sense (class ...). Better use a clean language like Python 3.,2018-08-03T12:22:31.450,5219
13124,4957,1,I think you need to be especially careful here to account for personality. An extremely introverted person might not do well in such an examination even having contributed to (or created) the work. For group projects I used a (conceptually) related idea. Every project (or a subset if the class was too large) did a presentation of results to the class. Everyone on the team had to take a turn in the spotlight. It pretty much guaranteed that those who contributed less were forced to learn what the team did. Some folks (extreme stutterers for example) found it hard but doable.,2018-08-03T12:55:42.437,1293
13125,4957,0,_@Buffy you are absolutely right. But on the other hand for such people it is even more important to overcome such and this is useful training.,2018-08-03T13:16:31.577,5219

13134,4869,1,_@JustBlossom I have amended answer: hope is is clearer. When a test fails (not compilation error). When a test fails it succeeds to find a problem in the production code.

Short of the real Ancients of Days (i.e.: EDVAC & ENIAC) and bleeding edge (for any time period) stuff like the CRAY series I have been around samples from each generation while they were in daily use rather than on display. With a few exceptions I've also programmed on a few machines from each and repaired or maintained a few as well. Unfortunately for the question I also don't have the sense of wonder about it.

13152,4968,0,As a programming teacher the codingbat about page resonates with me: http://codingbat.com/about.html . I recommend read that particularly the part about turning big problems into little problems. It?€?s not C++ but you could start some of the Java or Python problems to build your speed over a week and continue this practice to improve your problem solving speed and proficiency.,2018-08-11T12:55:57.580,2122
13153,4869,0,Yup that's clearer. It's kind of like you're stress testing your code and making sure that you're not only testing for what you know will work. Thanks!,2018-08-13T03:42:30.700,5476
13154,4869,0,Yes If you write tests that always pass you are wasting your time (expect that writing the tests makes you think). You could have the same outcome by not writing and running the tests. And if a test never fails you do not know if it can fail. Therefore write the tests first: so that you think so that you can test the tests (they fail).,2018-08-13T09:43:37.737,204
13155,4967,0,In one of the lectures I attended as an undergrad we passed round a mercury delay line.

13159,4975,0,Pair programming takes about 2 weeks to get up to speed before that it is slower. However I have done pair programming with a pier on very difficult tasks and we were more effective almost immediately. I suspect that for the OP they will be slower for the first 2 weeks but because of training value it will pay have positive value immediately. (note: Pair programming would have been my answer. But Buffy did it first and better.),2018-08-15T09:26:48.640,204
13160,4981,3,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. This is a great question and I believe you'll get some excellent answers. I hope you do and that you hang around a while as well. Although it's often quiet you may also wish to pop into the site's [chatroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) on occasion.,2018-08-15T15:49:33.247,104

13162,4981,0,Once you get into it a bit more you'll realize that the number of columns does not increase the complexity only the number and types of keys and the types of relationships. Most of the columns on any table are just cargo from the perspective of database design.,2018-08-16T03:13:00.243,1537
13163,4985,1,Give some more context. What level are you? Why only self-learning as a tag? Why do you think the run time estimates are _not_ rigorous?,2018-08-16T10:45:05.967,1293
13164,4981,1,_@pojo-guy It increases complexity when it takes 5-10 minutes to go through which columns are even an option. :) If I don't know what I can select for learning all of that takes time particularly when the columns are in a list view with sections by table. It kinda looks a lot like the Stack Exchange SEDE: https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new But with more columns.,2018-08-16T13:12:26.967,5592
13165,4978,1,Also a general page about bringing CS50 AP to your school can be found [here](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/resources/teaching/teaching.html).,2018-08-16T14:49:57.707,5589
13166,4981,0,Years of experience here - knowing what to ignore and for how long. Start with the unique indexes and foreign key relationships. Identify root tables and their children. Ignore the other columns until you have the relations under control.,2018-08-16T15:41:29.410,1537
13167,4985,1,I'm not entirely sure what you mean by a rigorous way. On the flip side it seems you're looking for ways to define things in CS rigorously not learn CS rigorously.,2018-08-16T16:40:55.893,104
13168,4968,0,Dang. I was in the same boat a couple of years ago. One thing that helped me was doing actual projects. I always did poorly on those things where I just had to remember how something worked but when I started working on open source projects and doing my own stuff everything made so much more sense. Now I can go back and do those same interview/skillbuilder type questions I used to struggle with. Just keep practicing be patient and apply what you learn whenever you can.,2018-08-16T20:51:58.897,5476
13173,4991,1,seems relevant to me. It is about teaching or learning. It is about computer science IT or digital literacy. ???,2018-08-18T17:13:37.107,204
13175,4992,1,Practicing with exercises will work just fine (see anybody who is learning to play a musical instrument) but from a motivational perspective I would additionally recommend to immediately try to apply the newly gained knowledge to a relevant problem one actually wants (or at least: needs) to solve.,2018-08-19T16:33:04.140,1940
13176,4981,0,For me self-learning needs motivation - I need a problem to solve a solution to find.  For DB work I tend to think the key is learning syntax data types and how to interpret the question being asked. A database is raw data - how you interpret the question and query the db determines if your data becomes information or not :),2018-08-20T01:38:02.067,662
13177,4974,0,As some one who teaches Linux admin stuff and programming at the tech-degree level I really wish I had a good answer for you.  It really can be a struggle explaining look you know X about technology Y now here's how tech X and W are basically the same thing how do you think W should work?  I know that as a long time LAMP guy if you dropped me in a ASP.Net/IIS job I'd flounder for a long time - but I think I'd at least have an idea as to what questions to start asking.,2018-08-20T01:48:21.943,662
13178,4998,1,When it was said most programming can be looked up were they referring to things like Open Source or other pre-written or pre-defined libraries or collections? It would be like saying that most woodworking has already been done we can just fit together wooden parts because the power tools are so widely available. Programming is partly about creating the means to do something and partly about actually doing it. The actually doing will go on no matter how good the means have become. Deciding what to do and how to use a power tool is still a creative activity.,2018-08-20T13:57:49.210,5349
13179,4991,0,Is this the first such system you have tried to learn? The first one is going to be gobbledygook the 2nd one will be a bit familiar the 3rd will totally make sense and then you can learn any similar system. Same with languages. Same with mathematics same with... everything. Try learning a different system then compare and contrast. Find the essential unity behind them the intention.,2018-08-20T15:58:13.897,5349
13181,4999,0,Actually @ScottRowe a field grows with the size of its practitioners. Math grows fast also but there is already so much of it  and so many practitioners that you can't see much of the horizon. Much like the universe itself.,2018-08-20T20:03:29.090,1293
13182,5001,0,Hi and welcome to [cseducators.se]! I gave a few questions for you. (1) Can you link to the original study? And (2) what result did you expect?,2018-08-20T23:39:54.517,27
13185,4999,0,_@scottrowe I don't think it has changed very fast (Hardware has improved very fast exponential growth but software has not always even been positive). see bret victor's future of programming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4 it is set in the 1960s but aimed at people in the 2010s. Why don't we learn from what has been done before? Why is software getting slower? using more memory?,2018-08-21T10:44:29.253,204
13186,4985,0,I have been asked to review this question (should I close). There are two comments that you need to address. Please improve the question or it may be closed.,2018-08-21T10:47:56.970,204
13187,4999,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I challenge that we haven't learned from the old stuff. A lot of it is just in the libraries now. You don't need to build a lot of the things today that you needed to in years past. We have faster bigger machines so that (a) the optimization that every programmer needed to do in the past in every program is now less important and (b) much of it is done by the compiler and associated tools. The problems that we can now solve are  also bigger now and were infeasible in the past.,2018-08-21T10:54:01.170,1293
13189,4999,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I have definitely watched *The Future of Programming* and showed it to my students. Bret seems to have disappeared from the public stage the past few years. I wonder what he is doing now?,2018-08-21T12:34:05.643,5349
13190,4999,0,_@ScottRowe. Sorry your metaphor fails the smell test. People to teach beginning students starting at a higher level than the absolute base. I have a doctorate and fifty years of experience. I know quite a lot. Do I expect my students to follow my path in every detail to learn what I know. That would be profoundly stupid. And if they did it they would be 70 years behind the curve. You are ignoring the power of abstraction. Sorry. No.,2018-08-21T12:35:02.827,1293
13191,5002,2,Piaget's transition from Pre-operational thought to Concrete operational thought happens around age 11. Concrete operations include the conceptual understanding of Conservation Reflexivity and Transitivity. These are vital for basic computer programming capability. But the Formal operational abilities to abstract and manipulate things symbolically (not just in a familiar scenario) around age 14 are necessary to be good at programming. Mathematics is the single best training environment for developing these capacities. Without the right training many adults never gain these abilities.,2018-08-21T13:22:51.910,5349
13192,4999,0,I want someone with a doctorate and 50 years experience writing any software that is safety-related or that holds my personal information. For anything not connected to those two whatever. Unfortunately now everything is connected.,2018-08-21T13:29:44.863,5349
13193,4998,0,I'm not sure if this is quite on-topic for the site as written. It seems more like a history question than a problem needing a solution. Perhaps with the acknowledgment of the difference between practice now and instructor descriptions given by the younger generation a better question might be about converting classroom practice to accommodate that change.,2018-08-21T14:50:31.167,104
13195,4987,0,What do you do when the manual is broken has important things missing not maintained or new products/technologies don't even get a manual?,2018-08-21T21:48:33.367,5146
13196,5004,0,But sometimes people actually do not get the simple aspect of it. I can't tell you how many times my partner in the Compiler course in college declared *p and then just wrote to it. Boom!,2018-08-22T13:13:31.677,5349
13197,5003,0,Pointers are basically the threshold of understanding where Concrete Operations crosses over to Formal Operations (Piaget's definitions). They are an example of the increased complexity of indirection and symbolic thinking. Some grasp easier than others for a multitude of reasons.,2018-08-22T13:16:44.960,5349
13198,4781,1,_@RonJohn: You can't _force_ someone to enjoy. But you can teach them how to find the joy in doing something. As a simple example to prove the principle young children can often be motivated to do something by claiming that they're not able to do it. While that is very basic reverse psychology it proves that you can change someone's experience with the same chore by reframing it for them.,2018-08-22T13:42:12.320,2164
13199,4781,0,_@Flater you can teach me how *some people* will enjoy salesmanship and you can teach me the usefulness of selling but you'll never teach **me** to **enjoy** selling.,2018-08-22T14:08:39.510,3132
13200,4781,0,_@RonJohn: OP was not explicitly asking for a _surefire_ way to teach _literally anyone_ to enjoy programming. That is warping the question to suit your answer.,2018-08-22T14:25:45.133,2164
13201,4781,0,_@Flater OP's student might see all the money earned by programmers and want that but still might not be temperamentally suited to being a programmer.  (I'm not a fan at all of CP4E.),2018-08-22T14:29:28.050,3132
13202,4781,0,_@RonJohn: It seems you have mlisunderstood the context for this question. Motivation (such as financial earnings) is not the same as enjoyment. I have no idea why you're bringing up being temperamentally suited for programming - that is not part of the question at any rate.,2018-08-22T14:32:03.700,2164
13203,4781,0,_@Flater the last sentence of the question is *What can I do in order for another person to **experience the feeling** that programming is an activity you can do for **fun and recreation**?*  Some people can never experience it.,2018-08-22T14:51:11.250,3132
13204,4781,0,_@RonJohn: I have already responded to that argument several comments ago. Your comments are not forming a coherent discussion there is no benefit to continuing this.,2018-08-22T15:10:58.070,2164
13205,4781,0,_@Flater you say I didn't address the question so I quote the Question.  Nothing you've written has addressed that.,2018-08-22T15:14:32.190,3132
13206,4781,0,_@RonJohn: I have already responded to that argument several comments ago.,2018-08-22T15:16:43.953,2164
13207,5004,0,_@ScottRowe part of that is just the denseness of C notations generally. Things that look similar aren't. C programmers needs to keep a lot of things in their heads simultaneously. See Miller's Rule of Seven - Plus or Minus Two.,2018-08-22T16:56:17.773,1293
13209,5004,0,_@ScottRowe Java uses indirection extensively and intensively. So do other (not all) OO languages. I assume you know that.,2018-08-22T18:26:29.080,1293
13211,5005,1,C is a polite veneer over Assembly. C programmers know that a memory location holds a binary number but that number could *represent* a constant the location of a variable a pointer - which might change as the program runs and so on. C programmers have to know how the machine really works so they are not confused or mislead that there are different kinds of things in memory. No there are just bits in memory. The compiler helps you organize that but it is up to the programmer to know what they *mean* by each type of thing. Like how all living things have DNA as their representation.,2018-08-24T14:33:30.687,5349
13213,4985,0,By rigorous I'm assuming you mean in a way that can be formally proven (in the mathematical proof sense) to be correct or incorrect.

13225,5008,0,I won't disagree because I've already agreed. There's one sentence hidden in my wall of text: _Technically speaking variables are an indirection but somehow we manage to address that just fine._ I believe that any concept can be apprehended with the correct mental model for it.

13230,4987,0,I'm not a programmer though... I don't have any old projects... and I'm not sure what you mean in your last paragraph in that section. Why would I go to all the work to create a database from scratch that won't be anywhere near as complex (or in the same syntax) as the one I need to learn to use? This seems like a lot of work for little gain. I'm not actually even sure what you mean by code based projects. I'm using the database directly not trying to implement it into something - imagine something like SEDE here on SE.,2018-08-28T02:38:29.010,5592
13231,4987,0,_@KabaKun The suggestion to use MySQL was If a local install of a server with T-SQL is not possible The paragraph in question was because I thought correctly that you would be using direct DBMS access. Why to use something less complex than the one at work is because you don't design a skyscraper until you can design a flat-level house. You have to have basic knowledge and keep building into larger more complex projects. A lot of work for little gain defines any educational exercise. The gain is experience.,2018-08-28T04:29:13.637,104

13234,4987,0,A simple search uses one table retrieves one column and is selected by one value in one field. Anything else has to build on that. Practice - in some fashion is the only way you will move to more complex work. If you cannot understand the big database use a smaller one.

13236,5011,0,Also Pascal courses were modeled after the Fortran initiation they replaced so the pointers chapter that didn't exist in Fortran appeared after the usual chapters (themselves derived from the order of chapters in the first Fortran manual another story). A reason to consider it as advanced stuff (and superfluous like recursion) because nobody used that in the Fortran course.,2018-08-29T13:41:44.303,2103
13237,5011,0,Interesting I have not given much thought to Fortran in a while. It was designed for handling mathematical problems not for writing software. You probably could not write a compiler in Fortran (or SQL for that matter). There must be some sort of recognized distinction between General Purpose programming languages and those designed for Domain Specific purposes. Excel can do a lot of stuff but you can't write programs with it despite it having several ways of handling indirection. Access is powerful but reports are not really programs either.

13238,5012,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]!

13245,4987,0,I don't think you're really listening to me or reading what I write. The database isn't what I don't understand and implying that simple searches are what you say is very unkind. Even initial searches on both of the tutorials I've **completed** start with calling *all* content using `*`. If you're getting frustrated with me fine but implying that I'm incompetent because I can't make sense out of very complex SQL calls that use syntax not taught in tutorials is just wrong.,2018-08-31T01:56:10.437,5592
13246,5011,0,I wish I had more insight into the whole languages issue. Why were 400 High Level languages developed over the past 30 years or so? I am told that some are optimized for some purposes. But the SICP book showed 35 years ago that one can create essentially anything at all pretty easily with Lisp. The fault is apparently not in our CPUs but in ourselves.,2018-08-31T13:12:01.483,5349
13247,5011,0,There are probably much more high level programming languages if you count the programming languages designed and implemented by students as en exercise or by programmers for specific needs. You can do anything with Lisp or Fortran or C or whatever but sometimes another programming language is more adequate for the job. Peter Landin's  paper title the next 700 programming languages is an allusion to the estimated number of languages at the time he wrote it (1966) half a century ago.,2018-08-31T13:52:43.160,2103
13248,5011,0,Wow that was a prophetic title for a book! It seems strange to me that in some areas like Windows and Office products one standard tends to take over. Excel is the most used piece of software in the world I think. But in the area of programming languages we just seem to create more. What is up with that? It is great to have so many standards to choose from but isn't that somewhat in conflict with the idea of creating a standard in the first place? Wouldn't cooperating to make a few really great languages be better? Couldn't we create all these domain-specific things with C underneath?,2018-08-31T14:07:47.217,5349

13254,5019,2,Hi Elsayegh88 welcome to [cseducators.se]! You're in the right community but if you want help the question will have to be re-formed a little bit. It can be a little confusing as a newcomer but if you make it one question and I will help you edit it to bring it to site standards. (You can post as many questions as you want on the site so there is no need for multiple unrelated questions within one prompt),2018-09-01T20:39:18.060,27
13256,5008,0,That backs up what I said. Everything is fine until someone puts the word _pointer_ on the table. Then it's suddenly hard to do. If you understand memory for variables and addresses for function calls then pointers are just more of the same. Don't blame the student or the concept blame the presentation. My recent experience with pointers in C a new language for me empirically supports my belief.,2018-09-02T13:35:18.030,104
13260,5023,15,As an extra source of input have you seen the other question [Real life examples of 0-indexing](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/213/104)? Might be some help there.,2018-09-03T02:05:53.543,104

13263,215,0,_@RaimundKr??mer well that's a defect of the way we talk about arrays probably stemming back to Fortran days. I avoid using _erstes_ _zweites_ etc. to refer to array elements and say instead _Startelement_ and _Nachfolgerelement_. In English I use list terminology: the _head_ and the _head of tail_. (Naming more than the frontmost two the last or the middle elements is seldom necessary.),2018-09-03T10:56:04.110,1157
13264,5031,7,Give your students this simple task and they will find the answer themselves: **Number these ten students each with a unique number but you can only use a single digit** - they will quickly come up with the solution to number then 0 to 9 - and that is why we index starting at zero we don't like waste :-),2018-09-03T11:46:22.797,5414
13267,5026,28,Nice contribution and good insight. You've made this corner of the internet a better place :) Welcome to [cseducators.se]. Take a look around I'd love to know what else you can add.,2018-09-03T12:11:14.367,27
13268,5027,3,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Isn't this just a restatement of OP's third bullet?,2018-09-03T12:16:47.047,27
13269,5027,0,yes the pointer (which is the array) contains the 1st element then you add 1 to get the next element etc. In assembler we were taught indexing to access arrays so moving to C it all made simple sense.,2018-09-03T12:17:57.977,5677

13275,5031,19,Interestingly all the *early* languages have *one*-based (or *user-defined*) indexing (e.g. Fortran (1957) Algol (1958)) or don't have a notion of array at all (Lisp (1957)). Zero-based indexing is a rather *modern* invention.,2018-09-03T14:51:44.770,945
13276,5024,2,Ah but some of us are willing to say zero-th also.,2018-09-03T14:54:34.190,1293
13281,5031,9,Interesting that on rotary telephones 0 (with ten pulses) comes after 9 but then pulsing the line zero times doesn't really work physically.,2018-09-03T17:36:39.273,5349
13282,5028,1,It would seem that in Barcelona the first floor is one floor above the primary floor which name suggest that it is the origin for the building's life. The ground floor is presumably where garage storage utilities and other facilities exist while regular rooms (kitchen etc.) are on the primary floor. Servants' quarters are also likely to be below the primary floor. The ground floor would presumably have an index of -1.,2018-09-03T17:41:29.540,104
13290,4951,0,_@Bilkokuya So you are directing them what to do but also asking a question to make them pay attention to what they are doing. Is that correct?,2018-09-03T22:13:09.313,204
13295,5031,6,_@J??rgWMittag: Interesting!  I wonder if designers of early languages were thinking that anyone who knew how computers and binary numbers really worked would just write in assembly language.  Early computers were slow and early compilers presumably didn't optimize well / at all.  Anyway this answer is exactly what occurred to me too: letting an N-bit index address a full 2^N elements.  Power-of-2 buffer/object sizes are a big deal.,2018-09-04T00:01:16.903,1654
13296,5030,2,I think the C equivalence of `arr[i]` = `*(arr+i)` follows from its choice of zero-based indexing not the other way around.  But good point that having pointer arithmetic at all makes zero-based indexing much more natural and that most still-used languages with 1-based indexing don't have that.  C started as a portable assembly language so it's totally natural that it works like asm in this regard.,2018-09-04T00:04:28.720,1654
13297,5031,2,_@PeterCordes languages have been a search for higher levels of abstraction and the ability to write more complex programs without getting lost in the details of assembler. The assumption was that problems were outgrowing our ability to think about them in low level terms. Languages aren't a placebo for babies but a tool for experts. For a shock look at the Google home page. Then use your browser to look at the actual source for that. Now try to duplicate it in assembler. Note that even assembler is a language with _minimal_ abstraction unlike machine code with none at all.,2018-09-04T00:08:07.377,1293
13298,5031,0,_@Buffy: Yes I understand that's the other motivation for higher-level languages and why I use `bash` as a shell instead of an interactive assembler where I'd type `mov eax __NR_fork` / `syscall`.  But I thought 1958 was still early enough in the history of computing that performance might still trump everything for many problems.  I could easily be wrong.   Having grown up with C (and assembly) 1-based indexing seems totally unnecessary and unnatural *to me*.  I'm not familiar enough with the history of computing and the motivations of early language architects to rule out my guess.,2018-09-04T00:15:51.437,1654
13301,5030,1,_@PeterCordes I'm not sure. But I think the fact that the array operator can be used for pointer arithmetic at all (such as `ptr[-5]`) played a role in defining that `ptr[i]` is equal to `*(ptr+i)`.,2018-09-04T05:53:55.767,4461
13303,5027,0,Welcome to the community please read the question. The OP states in the question that this explanation is unsatisfactory for the intended audience.,2018-09-04T07:58:52.110,204
13304,5031,7,_@ScottRowe zero had 11 pulses and one had 2 pulses. This was to stop the equipment reacting to random single pulses.,2018-09-04T08:09:54.807,204
13305,5028,2,In one university I have visited the floor numbers were in feet above sea level. So not even consecutive. (This is also discussed here https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/215/204 ),2018-09-04T08:19:36.933,204
13306,5019,0,I have edited question to address concerns. @Elsayegh88 can you create a new question for the bit I removed (One question per question).

13312,5028,4,The reason for the numbering of floors in Barcelona is due to an old building regulation which dictated no buildings could have more than six floors. To work around this restriction extra floor names were added so that the maximum numbered floor was always #6. The extra floor names are Entresuelo and Principal just above the ground floor and Atico and Sobreatico just above the sixth floor. (Not all buildings will have all of these floor names).,2018-09-04T12:20:14.587,4047
13314,5026,3,While a good reason to start indexing at 0 it feels much easier and more natural to mentally parse (d) and especially (c) than (a) or (b) - numbers from x to y in natural language usually means inclusive of both (or exclusive of both),2018-09-04T13:34:16.990,5743
13315,5017,0,_@RonJohn agreed on programming concepts--but syntax is usually something that can be drilled. I want my students to be able to recognize the import of certain syntax in the way a math teacher would want his/her students to recognize the significance of the sigma symbol for a summation function.,2018-09-04T14:12:55.653,4689
13316,5017,0,Well C# (and C++ and Java) is hell spawn so you're right drilling syntax is probably useful...  #sadface,2018-09-04T14:24:51.020,3132
13319,5026,2,Note that adopting the convention more widely helps in a number of other scenarios not just array indices.  For instance it [eliminates a whole class of errors in date handling](https://sqlblog.org/2011/10/19/what-do-between-and-the-devil-have-in-common).  If you're doing something like a fee scale for package weights the exclusive upper-bound also allows measurement result to be independent of the limit specified (ie - if an inclusive upper bound is given as `2.9` but the scale measures as `2.95` you have issues).,2018-09-04T16:21:59.273,3821
13321,5030,3,The advantage of zero-based indexing becomes even more apparent when you need to map a 2D matrix to a linear array.,2018-09-04T18:13:01.297,897
13328,5028,1,There's nothing factually incorrect about these examples but it doesn't mean that it's logical.  The first hour of the day on a 12 hour clock starts is 12 (while minutes start at 0) and the second hour starts a 1.  A 24 hour clock starts at 0.  Which makes more sense?,2018-09-04T19:55:20.310,2087
13335,5026,3,_@msam: Fully closed or fully open may be more natural but the subtraction property of half-open is extremely important.  The interval [a a+b) is exactly b elements long without any pesky +1 or -1 terms.  You simply cannot avoid having +1s and -1s everywhere when you use fully closed or fully open intervals.,2018-09-05T01:30:59.653,1896
13338,5026,8,This also matches the behavior of the modulo operator the return value of which lies in [0 n). `number_of_values_ending_in_a_particular_digit[x % 10] += 1`,2018-09-05T01:48:00.613,5767
13339,5038,1,I like this.  This is also a useful way of thinking about labels in assembly language (as zero-width).  Addresses and labels don't have any natural width associated with them; that depends on what type of load/store you do.  (The type system in most languages associates an element width with a pointer but this is why you can't add/subtract `void*` in C.),2018-09-05T01:54:04.577,1654
13340,5031,2,_@PeterCordes It's one of the reasons so many computer scientists/engineers hated C and Unix - they took the performance is better than correctness approach which was contrary to the prevailing thought as computer software gets more complex it's even *more* important to keep things correct. A correct program that's easy to understand gives you more opportunities for performance improvements too - most of the time when a C program was faster it did so by sacrificing correctness (e.g. ignoring boundary conditions). Dijkstra's lessons on sustainability and quality of software are great intro,2018-09-05T08:59:01.297,1816
13341,5027,0,Keep in mind that C arrays are rather plain. In many languages the pointer refers not to the first item but to things such as the length of the array. And yet both 0-indexed and 1-indexed arrays exist. Indeed you could use your argument to argue that arrays should start at 1 because that would allow you to store metadata in the 0 offset.,2018-09-05T09:05:23.960,1816
13342,5031,1,_@Luaan: I'm not familiar with early C or Unix being unpopular for that reason. Early compilers sucked at optimization so to make things fast people left out safety checks?  These days optimizing compilers can hoist bounds-checks out of loops if it's the same bounds on every iteration so you can write safer code (especially with C++ to hide the noise behind `std::vector`).  C makes correctness optional and makes you do it yourself but it's still possible to write correct C functions / programs.  These days it's a nice language for writing hot loops but not great for maintainability.,2018-09-05T09:10:20.987,1654
13343,5031,0,_@Luaan: Anyway I don't see what zero-indexing has to do with correctness in any given language.  zero-indexing isn't *why* C makes unsafe code more easily possible.  Correlation / causation?,2018-09-05T09:12:33.157,1654
13347,4775,0,But what if you want to implement something like a video game? Mutation is an integral part of programs like those.???€? I believe that is a common misconception. Super Monao Bros is a Jump&Run Clone in Haskell. I once read an interesting blog series about Purely Functional Retrogames. Idris as a language is not only purely functional (no side-effects) but also total (always terminates i.e. no endless recursion no endless loops and thus not Turing-complete) and one of the example programs is an Asteroids clone. [Note: technically speaking Idris does not forbid writing non-terminating ?€?,2018-09-05T12:46:07.263,945

This is unlike other dependently-typed languages where you are not allowed to write non-terminating programs and thus often have to jump through hoops to get the compiler to realize that your programs is actually terminating in all cases.],2018-09-05T12:46:33.223,945
13350,5031,0,_@PeterCordes You need to compare early C with languages of the time - C lacked pretty much all the things that other languages used to help you write correct programs. The goal in C was simplicity on the compiler and potentially performance the trade-off was effort on part of the programmer. Contrast the difference between say iterating over an array in a for loop and doing a `map` - in the first case you've opened yourself to potential incorrectness (out-of-bounds etc.) in the second these don't even make sense. C's design went directly against what those people thought was good design.,2018-09-05T13:18:38.540,1816
13351,5031,1,_@Luaan don't lose track of the fact that C excelled at the task it was actually designed for. Kernighan and Ritchie were at the time at Bell Labs looking for a Better Assembler for a spare DEC PDP-7 computer they were using to develop Unix. It has the features it has precisely to match instructions in the PDP assembler set. That it was used for other purposes is a fact of history of course but for its designed usage it was near ideal. Ritchie wasn't trying to outdo Algol (or COBOL of course) just do assembler more effectively.,2018-09-05T13:25:11.927,1293
13352,5031,1,_@Luaan however don't conclude from the above that I think C is a _good_ or even _adequate_ solution for modern programming. I would use it if I were writing device drivers and such but prefer a safer language with  features such as those described by user Peter Cordes. Even safe auto-typing is a big win. Actually safe anything is a big win especially memory management.,2018-09-05T13:34:01.770,1293

13366,5026,0,This is a good reason but I think a more fundamental one is simply hardware: binary registers and memory locations representing unsigned integers have a 0 all bits off state. Indexing by one would waste that.,2018-09-05T17:14:58.923,4440

13381,691,3,_@ctrl-alt-delor actually it?€?s the perfect example of what a mess is created when not using index zero. ?€?Most people get this wrong?€? by intuitively assuming that a century should start with year zero and end with year 99 and are ?€?wrong?€? because there was no year zero. But we still live in the 21st century whose index (year number) starts with a 20 (except for the last one) and the third millennium whose index (year number) starts with a two (except for the last one). And if that one guy was truly born 24.12.1 your 2nd party was wrong as well (otherwise that number is totally meaningless).,2018-09-06T11:55:33.027,5814
13383,5026,1,Every answer with Dijkstra in it is nice. But......... this answer seems to answer a completely different question doesn't it? This answer only concerns itself with the openness of intervalls. Neither the quote from Dijkstra nor the rest of the answer has anything to do at all with the actual question - which is to rephrase a bit why do array indices start at 0 (sic).,2018-09-06T12:07:56.493,652
13384,5029,1,Indeed BCPL seems to be origin of 0-based indexing. We can try to explain to ourselves or to pupils why indexing starts from 0 but the fact is that it only does so in certain languages and that most of those do so out of historical reasons. This blog shines some light on the origin of 0-indexing: http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/,2018-09-06T12:37:15.973,5815

13386,5029,1,... It reflects that the author is clearly digging into software history for the first time and is suprised by his discoveries thinking that perhaps no-one else knows this. However his conclusions are a bit inconsistent. Zero based indexing in BCPL was an inevitable consequence of having pointers rather than arrays as the fundamental data structuring concept it wasn't to make array indexing more efficient.,2018-09-06T13:38:34.943,2936

13389,5028,4,+1 but this is only half the answer. The other half is that in the 70's C made the choice to directly support only indexing arrays from 0 as this made the compiler simplest (which was really C's primary design goal). Because C compilers were so simple they were easy to make and put on any machine and as a result of this and a few other bits of historical luck C became super popular. As a result of that a whole host of other languages took their lead from C.,2018-09-06T14:32:56.233,1139
13390,5030,2,This is the missing half of Jorg's answer which together make the **correct** answer. C made the choice to only support indexing arrays from 0 and after it became popular it influenced the design of a lot of other languages. However its quite likely *most* languages don't force a 0-based index and some people thinking this is a computer language thing (or worse yet a Computer Science thing) is nothing more than myopia.,2018-09-06T14:37:01.560,1139
13391,5028,0,_@Philm: The Wiki discussion I linked to has an even more confusing example.

13396,5027,0,_@Luaan If the metadata is at 0 offset there's no guarantee it's the same number of bytes as each entry. In reality it's a packed format: `metadata` + N x `array-item`. Only the `array-item`s are guaranteed to each be the same size. The array part is still 0 based.,2018-09-06T23:43:02.667,1279
13397,5026,1,Those reasons don't seem entirely compelling in the argument of 0 vs 1.  For example in the second point you can argue that sequences starting with 1 don't need negative numbers either and in the third point you can argue that sequences starting with 1 also don't use negative numbers for zero-length (although the counter-counter-argument is that they still require reversed bounds which may be confusing).  And if you know that the lower bound is 1 then the upper bound in form (c) is also the length no arithmetic required.,2018-09-07T00:25:39.607,5829

13432,5052,4,Actually not everyone agrees with your first paragraph. Some count centuries starting with year 1 as in 1901 thru 2000. There was a lot of worry about that at the millennium and the danger that systems would fail at the rollover whenever that was. Also I'll note that the Western calendar doesn't have a year 0. It jumps from 1BCE to 1CE with no 0 in between. Personally though The 17th century being the sixteen-hundreds has always been a pain for me.,2018-09-11T16:17:15.313,1293

13446,5043,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Actually except for the placement of the tanks this is not far off from the real process.

13447,5027,0,_@CJDennis As surprising as it might sound plenty of languages older than C didn't have this problem at all - e.g. all arrays had the same element size. C became somewhat famous for encouraging these kinds of hardware-specific optimizations (of course how effective these turned out to be depended entirely on the programmer). Many considered this to be a step back - instruction-by-instruction performance wasn't thought as an end goal in itself. But regardless this doesn't change that as soon as you need an offset anyway 0-based arrays are no longer easier to index than 1-based.,2018-09-13T10:18:34.287,1816
13448,5030,0,_@200_success Not really - that's just an entirely *separate* advantage of zero-based indexing. And rarely needs to be explicit in the external interface anyway - that's just again going back to C's pointer arithmetic fetish. How structures are laid out in memory shouldn't be used to design how they're supposed to be used. If you have code-level abstraction what's the difference between `matrix[0 0]` and `matrix[1 1]`? How does it affect your use of `matrix.ToLinear()`? The interface should be meaningful on its own separate of its concrete implementation.,2018-09-13T10:26:34.747,1816
13449,5042,0,You're blinded by what you're used to. `for` loops are looping from `a` to `b`. *Count* is entirely irrelevant! Pascal made this much more explicit in its own loop structures - `for i := 1 to 10` makes this rather obvious. As far as I'm concerned your code assumes that one variable contains *two* separate meanings that happen to coincide. That's *wrong*; it may be useful for some cases but you're reusing the same variable to mean two different things. `i` doesn't contain the count because that's it's purpose - it contains it by accident. The same with your buckets example.,2018-09-13T10:34:20.710,1816
13450,5036,0,_@Kaz That simply isn't true at all. This should be pretty obvious when you take into account that zero-as-a-number is a rather recent invention compared to natural numbers. People always considered nothing as a special case and it took effort to introduce zero to math in a meaningful way (and at the cost of confusions like division by zero). You may have been *taught* to count from zero but it certainly isn't natural to humans. If you want to count sheep hopping over a fence do you initialize `cow_count` to zero first? I hope not :),2018-09-13T10:38:50.387,1816
13451,5048,1,BCPL where zero-based indexing probably originated didn't initialize variables. So that's hardly the right justification. Also *integers don't start at 0*. Integers don't *have* a start. As for a default in your favorite language (if it even has one) that's entirely arbitrary - zero is convenient in pre-zeroed memory but before modern memory management there were no definite default values. A pretty common practice is to always initialize variables with a meaningful value rather than some whateverdefault - e.g. if you want a control variable that counts down initialize it with count.,2018-09-13T10:45:28.927,1816
13452,5046,0,Pascal and Visual Basic (and many other Basics) also preferred natural indices. Using zero-based indexing really has to do with conflating indexing and pointer arithmetic. If I want an array from -10 to 10 why should I index it from 0 right? Let the compiler/library deal with the details. C didn't have indexing at all *only* pointer arithmetic so there was little choice. For some weird reason even today people still count this as C's *advantage* rather than misfeature. Oh well.,2018-09-13T10:49:20.133,1816
13453,5031,1,_@PeterCordes Early computers didn't have assemblers programs were written in machine language directly.,2018-09-13T10:51:37.720,4513
13454,5031,0,This answer addresses the question as I understood it.,2018-09-13T10:52:20.257,4513
13455,5045,0,Of course a compiler could optimize this away - this was very common on x86 for example because of its powerful memory addressing; especially since 486 and Pentium. And of course just have a look at any modern disassembled code - in most cases you will not find any direct indexing from the base of the array anyway. Ultimately in many cases indexing an array is a relic anyway - for most cases where you see indexing what you really want is iteration. It's just that many programmers and languages are stuck without distinction between the two.,2018-09-13T10:55:05.300,1816
13456,5053,0,Variables are entirely separate concept from memory; even today most of the variables you use never make it into memory. As for pointers... pointers are everywhere yes. Pointer *arithmetic* is a fetish that should have died ages ago. Multiplication *can* be explained in terms of addition but it doesn't have to. The reason we teach addition first is because it's easy to teach algebraically while multiplication makes far more sense geometrically - and it so happens that most math teachers are a lot more comfortable with algebra than geometry. But that's an entirely subjective value.,2018-09-13T10:55:58.590,1816
13457,5045,0,C or many other languages don't have iteration so we really should know what it is and how it works. Modern techniques sometimes are great but sometimes they are simply overcomplicated less comprehensive compared to [i] and I don't think there is no kind of index accessing behind iterators - we just don't see it any more. So I doubt iterators are really faster than a simple [i].,2018-09-13T11:07:29.373,5871
13458,5046,0,I considered including Basic but it was so long since I have used it that I was not sure.  Also as you hint it is probably dialect dependent.  I miss the ability to choose the minimum and maximum index.  It is a shame that it has not caught on.,2018-09-13T11:39:09.770,5875
13460,4344,0,In many resource-constrained settings like GPGPU work (or just GPU work in general) using floats is necessary. We're using 16-bit floats and 16-bit ints in a lot of circumstances to reduce memory pressure and increase execution speed. If you're writing a website go ahead and use doubles. If you're writing a game simulator / numerical modeling etc. or anything heavy on GPU usage use the smallest data type that meets the needs of the application.,2018-09-13T15:35:11.473,1777
13461,5045,0,C was deficient in that regard even in comparison with other languages *of its time*. And no they're certainly not *less* comprehensive. You need to look at code with fresh eyes - a lot of the crazy doesn't seem crazy anymore when you get used to it. The thing about iterators is that any indexing is strictly an implementation detail - which allows you to give much more freedom to the code that's using them as an interface. If you pass an array it will always be an array. If you pass an iterable the implementation can do whatever fits - like using a linked list.,2018-09-13T17:00:23.073,1816
13462,5045,0,Iterators can easily be faster than pointers and they can be slower than pointers. But they're definitely easier to understand and reason about and they allow a lot of optimisations that simply aren't possible with pointers to an array. Just consider something like map-reduce - it wouldn't be possible if people stuck to the idea that arrays are just a pointer to the first item in an array. Unsurprisingly it came from the other side of the language spectrum - languages that value abstraction over micro-tweaks.,2018-09-13T17:02:48.893,1816
13463,5046,0,Plenty of languages on the abstraction makes things easier side of the barrier still support ranges. You just need to give up C-like languages for the most part (though e.g. C# does have support for arbitrary indexing it's not really equal citizen compared to zero-based).,2018-09-13T17:05:01.083,1816
13464,5031,1,_@Willtech: Wasn't assembly well-established before higher-level languages came along?  Hmm maybe not but same difference in machine code directly: you add an offset to a pointer to get a new address.  (At least on machines that *have* normal address registers for indirect addressing or memory-indirect addressing)  And/or you have indexed addressing modes.  I don't think any hardware ISAs had 1-based indexed addressing but I don't actually know really early ISAs.  (I know 8-bit ISAs like 8080 have pointer registers though.),2018-09-13T17:23:11.137,1654
13465,5042,0,_@Luaan That's the whole point of my post! The multiple meanings don't happen to coincide; they are mathematically related and it is much easier to think about and check for errors if this relation is equal rather than off-by-one. I will admit there are a lot of times where I need to convert array indices to a 1-to-n system?€?but almost all of these are to pretty-print things for humans. That is an important consideration?€?after all we generally write programs using decimal not hex?€?however it is also important that code is as easy as possible to review for bugs.,2018-09-13T21:55:14.113,2592

13473,5031,1,_@PeterCordes Direct machine code programming preceded assembly languages assembly languages were the first higher level languages. Machine code vs assembly code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/466790/assembly-code-vs-machine-code-vs-object-code,2018-09-14T23:22:27.140,4513
13474,5031,1,_@Willtech: yes I know that.  I have a gold badge in the `[assembly]` tag over on SO.  My point was that normal hardware has 0-based indexing / pointer-math whether you generate machine-code from asm or write the machine code directly.  And my other point was to acknowledge that maybe I should have said machine code instead of assembly when talking about alternatives to higher-level languages like Fortran if asm wasn't already widespread before higher-level languages were first being developed.,2018-09-14T23:35:09.243,1654

13476,5066,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. Glad you picked this site as the home for your question. While Haskell is _way_ outside my experience I believe this is the place to find your answers if any exist that is. I've added some tags which you can remove if you choose that might help sort out what others see before opening your question.,2018-09-18T00:09:22.420,104
13477,5064,1,`if a runner goes from the 3 yard line to the 4 yard-line there is a (4-3) = 1 yard gain. However if your math teacher assigns problems 3-4 (integers)` The core difference here is that the former denotes the distance between points and the latter denotes the points themselves. 2017 and 2018 are two distinct years (points) but the timespan (distance) between NYE 2017 and NYE 2018 is _one year_. This does not actually answer why 0-based indexing is used as you're simply comparing two inherently different things. (_from 3 to 4_ vs _3 and 4_),2018-09-18T06:27:43.787,2164
13478,691,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor: You are correct. However this 0-based system is actually used to express the age of a person and people are not known to struggle with that. The difference is that when you're at age 0 we omit the year count altogether: He is 3 months old not He is 0 years and 3 months old. When you 0-index and you're at index 0 that often entails deferring to a more precise (non-0) measurement.,2018-09-18T06:33:10.797,2164
13479,4181,1,Using 0 and 1 for binary states is unrelated to the mathematical values of 0 and 1. We could instead use nothing and something and the entire field of logic would remain correct. This is why programming now favors `true` and `false` instead of a non-zero integer and a zero integer. It disambiguates logical evaluations from mathematical ones and prevents developers mistakenly assuming one for the other.,2018-09-18T06:37:12.860,2164
13480,4181,0,Maybe as a simpler example: while the logic (of an electrical device) links 0 to 0V the same does not apply to e.g. an abstract logical statement (all bald men wear hats). 0 does not bind to any particular integer value. Similarly setting a temperature switch to 0 does not inherently mean that it's now 0?? (before you argue that a temperature switch is still electrical: non-electrical switches exist too!). There are only fringe cases in which the logical 0 corresponds to a mathematical 0. The logical 0 is not defined by the mathematical 0 their fringe correlation is coincidental.,2018-09-18T06:39:47.337,2164
13481,691,1,_@Flater yes you bring up an interesting point. In Europe and US we measure age so 3 years old means that you are between 3 and 4 years old that is have been alive 3 years but no more than 4 (Well maybe an extra ?? day see leap year). In some parts of the world they say what year you are in. Therefore a new born is 1 (in 1st year). This is similar to school year before we added year zero (K in US R in UK). In any respect the systems are all self consistent. but can result in an out by one error if the 2 people communicating are using a different system.,2018-09-18T07:11:34.727,204
13482,5048,0,_@Luaan Yeah this is what I meant by saying that it's arbitrary. I don't agree with BCPL as the origin. In asm when you think of a memory area as an array you index it with addr+(0*stride) addr+(1*stride) etc,2018-09-18T08:12:04.847,2800
13483,5048,0,In assembly you didn't have any abstraction (at first). Indexing an array is already an abstraction - it's a map between I want the 3rd element of the array and what's actually needed to get that particular element. The fact that you don't need to know the element size in BCPL (or anything else about the array) is a big difference. Indeed in assembly you'd often see very complicated addressing patterns that were tailored to the capabilities of the hardware rather than the logical structure of the program; in C if you wanted the next element you did `element++`.,2018-09-18T11:10:01.487,1816
13484,5048,0,Now it's true that in C that actually was a low-level pointer operation. But that's not the purpose of it that's just a constraint to make the compiler simpler. The meaning is still the next element or the 3rd element not pointer + 0x12. C is a rather bare language but it's still way above the abstraction of then-assembly. Meanings started to creep into things that used to be pure procedural code. Of course it couldn't compare to anything like LISP - the ties to hardware were far too strong for that. But there were things like `0` as pointer value or what `i++` means.,2018-09-18T11:13:18.803,1816
13485,5032,0,And if I add your SSN to my SSN... how does that translate to the array? Indices are a different level of abstraction than there's 20 bytes after this pointer that represent an array of `short`s. You can argue that (e.g.) C chose this way of representing arrays an indices because of performance targets but that's about all you can argue about that. A lot of the problems in software engineering stem from this way of thinking that just because it's possible to add two numbers together it makes sense. It may have it's place in the lowest levels of our systems but not normal application code.,2018-09-18T11:20:50.850,1816
13486,5048,0,_@Luaan This is why I wrote when you **think** of a memory as an array. It doesn't matter if the abstraction is a part of a language or your train of thought. BCPL built up on established standards of thinking about a program. I don't really get where are we going because I feel like you're restating my concepts but phrase them like counter-arguments. If you believe that my answer can be improved then it appears you need to be more specific.,2018-09-18T12:12:31.107,2800
13487,5064,0,One must use 0 as a base however.,2018-09-18T12:15:52.480,5930
13488,5064,1,`One must use 0 as a base`. I don't quite agree 0-indexing is not universally superior to 1-indexing. As I mentioned in my earlier comment it depends on what you're actually expressing (points the distance between them ...). There are many cases where the 0th element is a literal nothing thus precluding 0 from being relevant (especially when pertaining to physical objects).,2018-09-18T13:34:30.113,2164

13494,5069,0,Pseudo random numbers are perfectly fine. I just want them to be coming in a continuous stream rather than stored on the machine. I think InfoSphere stream is basically an environment you program in that handles the continuous streams of data in the background. So you would write code that would start listening to the stream (i.e. take a sample) and then compute on what you get during that sample.,2018-09-19T21:19:14.307,294

13500,5069,1,I think I'll just create a giant txt file of numbers (or words if we want to do a streaming algorithm on word data) and then have the students read it in line by line. To get practice with multiple streams I can give them several different txt documents.

13517,5077,0,I agree but the import of the question was whether textbooks or self-created 'books' are currently a useful resource for CS teaching. No one was saying that students should be compelled to read them. For anyone who thinks that they already understand the subject matter perhaps they should consider what Richard Feynman said. No one understands anything they are only just starting to learn it. Anyone who doesn't want to avail themselves of a ready collection of information to learn more is pretty short-sighted.,2018-09-24T21:19:36.480,5349
13518,4404,0,As someone who had read all the Tolkien books *Atlas Shrugged* and *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* by the age of 14 all I can say is I hope this internet thing turns out to be better than reading books.

13523,5077,0,_@ScottRowe: Also not everyone learns from reading for reading's sake. There's a difference between having a book as documentation _should you need it_ and using the book to actually learn the basics. Especially in IT you'll find that a significant amount of learners are hands-on learners who generally only visit their resources when faced with a problem they can't solve (or are interested in finding a better solution).,2018-09-25T06:06:35.590,2164
13525,5077,0,Sure. When I first sat down at a PDP-11 terminal or Apple ][ 40 years ago there were no textbooks available it was all hands-on. But you can never type fast enough to make all the mistakes other people have already written about. Once people have seen all the walls they will want to read how to get out of the maze. I hope. At some point one would just reach for the books first thing. Or not.,2018-09-25T11:43:43.593,5349
13526,5080,1,Just as a thought experiment and a bit orthogonal have you considered whether it might be better to focus more on what you already do well going deeper rather than trying to cover things that might turn out to be sketchy?

13540,5083,0,Hi Mafii! I've never heard of NEAT before; based on my 1-minute glance on wikipedia it looks really cool! Seems to take inspiration from classic genetic algorithms (which I find interesting but hard to justify teaching when they are so sporadically applied). I think it would be a really cool think to mention/demonstrate but I highly doubt any undergrad AI survey course would be able to get far into it.

13549,5091,0,You are being annoyed at the language itself not the students. It is perfectly valid Python. Variable _name_ has a binding when _greeting_ is called.

13557,5093,0,You can also search on this site for Pair Programming to get a better sense of what it means.,2018-09-28T15:15:17.867,1293
13558,5093,1,_@Buffy After reading some of your responses it seems as though you come off pretty aggressive. I want to hear your answers but I also don't want to because of how it's presented. You had a good suggestion to Adam... but ouch.,2018-09-28T19:07:10.817,5994
13559,5092,0,I like this idea but I also don't want to add complexity to an awesomely simple language like Python. Another part of this is my ignorance to the whole `__name__ == __main__`. I have no idea what that is so I'm failing in that respect. Gotta go look that up now.,2018-09-28T19:10:40.163,5994
13560,5093,0,I'm both an educator and an educator of educators. Names are important. If a name is misleading don't use it. That is true both in programming and in education. I think it important to point that out especially on this site. Names are not in fact irrelevant. You can also search on this site for Naming for example. One reason that agile development often fails in use is that the people trying it don't understand it and don't even try to apply it correctly. It can be just a buzzword to cover bad practice. Pair Programming means what it means.,2018-09-28T19:13:53.407,1293
13561,5093,0,What you interpret as aggressive is sadly a consequence of the short format of comments. I don't have room here for a complete explanation so am forced to give short summaries on occasion.,2018-09-28T19:18:59.270,1293
13562,5092,1,Every language has its quirks @tazboy. Eventually you get used to that and just live with them. Alternatively you can work to build better languages. But at some level a program has to connect to the system on which it runs. That results in a lot of those quirks. But for teaching it is generally fine to ignore the details (while including them) until the student has a better overall grasp. The alternative is to tightly integrate a language and its OS as was done originally with Smalltalk and Oberon. You may think such necessary spells are Riddikulus and you'd be correct. Hard to avoid tho.,2018-09-28T19:28:05.643,1293
13563,5091,0,BTW if you are trying to teach Python but don't yet understand it thoroughly have a look at this question: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/4379/how-do-you-teach-something-when-you-dont-know-it-yourself. It is a common enough dilemma but there are solutions to it.,2018-09-28T20:05:09.857,1293
13564,5093,0,It's not the short format. And it is irrelevant to the op question.,2018-09-28T22:08:10.383,5994
13566,5092,0,Yeah. I just need to teach that concept in a different way now which is fine. This is  the first thing I encountered that I wasn't expecting and I'm really enjoying teaching Python. Thanks for info.,2018-09-28T22:57:10.470,5994
13568,5086,0,**Educate** you students then if the fees are high enough they will **train** them selves to use Cobol. While I agree that teaching language of the day is not a good strategy I also think that teaching an old language because we thing there is a market for these programmers is equally miss-guided. Teach using a good teaching language don't consider industry languages until the students can program well (they need to learn at least two languages anyway).,2018-09-29T17:21:51.580,204
13569,5081,0,I would be looking at using/creating a library that operates on sets/lists. With operations such as `is_all_in my_collection  (lambda x: x>7) : Boolean`. Some basic operations are `is_all collection lambda: Boolean` `contains collection lambda: Boolean` (at least one) `is_subset collection collection:Boolean` `union collection collection: set` `intersection collection collection: set`. I have used these libraries in many languages can't remember which.,2018-09-29T17:43:21.223,204
13571,5091,0,If you need to understand why the above happens and how Python handles top-level statements in any module see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18138166/what-is-a-top-level-statement-in-python,2018-09-30T14:09:43.410,1293
13573,5093,0,_@tazboy the general philosophy here is that the best answers should be useful to a future visitor not just the OP. A mailing list is perfectly adequate for answering immediate questions. However the fact that questions and answers here are preserved and searchable as well as tagged implies that there is a longer-term goal for this site. Future visitors probably won't have exactly the same problem but if it is related then the given answers might help them as well.,2018-09-30T14:20:11.287,1293
13577,5096,0,Do you do Processing in high school? I was thinking about teach p5.js but ended up with Python. Any issues or things you like?,2018-09-30T19:12:26.500,5994
13578,5096,0,The example was just something simple I could put up for a talking point. Reuse and readability are talking points for sure. Decomposition is a lot easier when it comes to drawing.,2018-09-30T19:16:24.297,5994
13579,5093,0,_@Buffy well... wow,2018-09-30T19:18:24.773,5994
13580,5096,0,_@tazboy That's the reason why I chose drawings for the first examples.,2018-09-30T19:40:01.843,2103
13581,5096,0,Yeah that's a great way to start. Did you do this in high school? How far do you go with them?,2018-09-30T19:46:49.793,5994
13584,5096,0,That a one year professional training program at the university. Processing is used to explain the basics of programming and algorithmic and then we switch to Java and other languages C# php  javascript etc.,2018-09-30T19:52:44.543,2103
13586,1408,0,Hi. Good luck. 12 year olds are just at the early stages of being able to abstract concepts to the level required for programming (at all) so some will struggle seriously while others will take to it like a duck to water. Take it in small steps choose problems that they can relate to (my 8 yo son is doing Minecraft mods in Java). One day you'll be thinking you're wasting time and resources and they aren't learning anything then you'll overhear them having an intelligent conversation about programming with someone else,2018-09-30T23:55:09.060,1537
13590,5102,0,Is the question _how to do it_ or is it _whether it is a good idea to do it_?,2018-10-03T00:00:41.407,1293
13591,5102,0,_@Buffy well I think we can safely assume that if it is a bad idea I would not want to do it since I am not egoically motivated.,2018-10-03T00:04:56.137,5349
13592,5103,0,Thank you I read that gamification results were equal for men and women so that is no issue. As for endorphin hits you just put my entire learning experience with programming in to perspective! I was doing incremental development and testing back in college. I never thought of it as mildly addictive before -- yet another thing that was right in front of my face. My goal is just to figure out what the heck online course design really is and I am not coming up with much except that it takes everything we have always done and makes it visible via a computer screen. Not such a big revolution.,2018-10-03T00:29:20.510,5349
13593,5102,0,I was surprised to read that about 30% of adults over age 25 play video games every day. I can't remember the last time I even saw a video game.,2018-10-03T00:38:40.493,5349
13594,5086,0,Frame challenge: *the world needs engineers to maintain it* isn't an appeal to altruism but to ambition. The subtext is *study this and you'll be guaranteed a stable job*.,2018-10-03T14:30:24.587,1219
13595,5106,0,Will you be with them as they view this material or is it strictly remote learning?,2018-10-03T16:35:28.383,1293
13596,5106,0,It will be an in-person presentation so I will be able to physically view their screens. Though it would be helpful to have a way to see their entries without having to physically go to each person's seat.,2018-10-03T18:32:52.233,5217
13597,5106,0,Someone else my have a direct answer but I question whether this is the most effective use of face-time.,2018-10-03T18:46:40.080,1293
13598,5106,0,_@Buffy Can you elaborate? I agree that if I'm there in person I should utilize that as much as possible but I also would like to avoid stalling everyone else's progress to give more one-on-one attention,2018-10-03T18:48:58.533,5217
13599,5106,1,Search here for Flip or Flipped Classroom. Do the same at https://academia.stackexchange.com. Use face time only for things that can't be done elsewhere. Pairing group projects self teaching etc. Not lecture even this sort of at your own speed lecture.,2018-10-03T18:53:00.017,1293
13600,5106,0,Thank you for the recommendation. My reservation to that would be that there is nothing I can do on my part to ensure that people consume any prerequisites I set for the sessions. I can send lectures or other informational content and say that they're necessary for the sessions to be helpful but my expectation would be that they would still just skim and skip the material or give it only a fragment of their attention,2018-10-03T19:02:30.507,5217
13601,5106,1,One problem I see with your scheme of letting people work through the material at their own rate (with you present) is that a lot of them will get stuck in different places and have questions. You don't have enough time to get around to all of them in a timely manner so they will just sit there - stuck - waiting for you to help. There has been research on labs with too few assistants and too many stuck students. I predict the same here.,2018-10-03T19:04:15.587,1293
13602,5106,0,My conception of the session was less of them working through a course with myself present to help but as a presentation I would lead with brief spurts of interaction that should only take a minute or two to complete. Point taken though,2018-10-03T19:07:25.467,5217
13603,5106,1,In a flipped classroom you don't need to _guarantee_ that they come prepared other than to have the activities in the room depend on that. With pairing and group work the knowledge can get spread among the students. If someone is too stuck point them to the readings. You can also require short written summaries of the readings as a ticket to the face sessions. One index card worth of summary is enough.,2018-10-03T19:07:34.633,1293
13604,5105,0,Well this is a good way to understand it thank you.,2018-10-04T01:30:46.720,5349
13605,5104,0,Thank you for the real life example that helps a lot. The statistics for this CSE site suggest that gamification is not particularly helpful at boosting engagement. With 5800 members only 30 are above 1000 points and a large number are at 101 which suggests that they came here from other sites only to comment. I bet that the curve for SO looks pretty similar with the vast majority of the millions of users asking only one Question and then moving on when they got what they needed.,2018-10-04T01:35:42.870,5349
13606,5104,0,Those who joined the site and did nothing or have asked a question and left with their answer can be ignored relative to your question. They would be the same as students from other departments stopping by your office to ask a question. (How do I unlock my laptop?) As I understand the question the gamification would be for increasing the engagement of students already interested in taking your course. Poking around at random in the low rep (<300) users for this site most of whom seem to not be teachers it seem about 25% visited within a month.

13611,5113,1,Implementing ArrayList or using the library class ArrayList from Collections?,2018-10-05T10:48:03.327,1293
13612,5114,0,Pretty close except that everyone sitting is guaranteed to fail here. Instead have a second process remove a chair after the music starts. If the music stops early everyone sits otherwise the usual thing. Even this is a bit suspect as one of the two processes (circling removing) will always fail.,2018-10-05T10:58:03.230,1293
13613,5115,0,Perfect! Thank you! This is a very obvious one. I suppose that's what I get for making slides at night.,2018-10-05T11:07:33.473,830
13614,5111,0,I find the Turtle and Hare comparison really nice as it nicely illustrate that one actor might be ?€?faster?€? than another one but might take ?€?pauses?€?. About the Dining Philosophers I would definitely use it to illustrate what a deadlock might be however I do think that the associated concepts might be a bit difficult to explain to a kid of that age (who would need two forks to eat??? ;) ),2018-10-05T17:57:35.970,6019
13616,5117,1,This would actually work. I would just have to make sure I'll have another screen at the venue. The other reason I need the streaming software is that I wanted to face the audience while I'm typing in my screen. Since typing directly into the projected screen would be awkward and hard.,2018-10-06T15:47:04.233,6029
13617,5116,1,Could you share some more information about the setup that you are rigging yourself into?,2018-10-06T17:44:11.533,27
13618,5117,1,Use a quad video card one output for your main screen then two (mirroring each other) for the presentation view. One of the mirrored outputs goes to a monitor facing you the other goes to the projector. You can do whatever you want with the 4th output.,2018-10-07T01:21:12.197,1537
13619,5116,1,This sounds like the inverse of a conversation I had a couple of years back. I was demonstrating a hardware solution and he kept asking what software I was using (it was PowerPoint). Your circumstance calls for a hardware solution.,2018-10-07T03:58:43.133,1537

13621,4877,1,_@hkBst thanks. fixed. I know that actually. Usually I get it right.,2018-10-07T13:02:28.017,1293
13622,4877,1,_@hkBst welcome to CSEducators by the way. When you earn 1K rep here you can make such changes yourself.,2018-10-07T13:24:33.380,1293
13624,5111,1,_@RenaudM. the dining philosophers problem makes more sense if the table is set with _chopsticks_  instead of forks.,2018-10-08T18:38:36.293,1269
13625,4956,0,I think we teach a subject best while we are learning it.,2018-10-08T20:45:33.970,5349
13626,4875,0,Kobayashi Maru was engaging because it is presented as a survival situation. Maybe if students knew the real stakes of learning they would see it that way.,2018-10-08T20:49:05.743,5349
13627,5122,0,How much support do you get from TAs? In particular what is the ratio of Student to TA? How long do the students have to complete the project?,2018-10-09T12:58:04.150,1293
13628,5122,0,This project is considered an exam so the tas should not help with them. They had five weeks to do the project considering that the project does not really need anything new from this course but could be done based on what they should have learned the first year.,2018-10-09T13:37:56.503,3908
13629,5122,0,I wasn't asking about how much help the TAs can give. I would like to know the load of the TAs to help me formulate an answer. Based on your comment is there any way a student can get any questions answered by you or anyone else about the project (other than your permission to coordinate on theory)?,2018-10-09T14:17:23.470,1293
13630,5122,2,Do you have any logs from the autotester? If they all decided to start the project the night before it was due that's going to end poorly. I find that to be one of the principle sources of low marks for my students. They do not allocate enough time to debug etc. It may have worked in the past but now they are expected to write more complicated programs.,2018-10-09T15:14:00.680,1879
13631,4490,0,You make a great point! I think I need to incorporate it into my answer. In any case I just voted yours up above mine. :-),2018-10-09T15:43:59.800,283
13632,5122,3,Have the automated tester and your model solution been well validated? Have you inspected any of the failing submissions by hand to verify that they should fail and why?,2018-10-09T16:09:59.803,104
13633,5122,1,Sorry for the delay I was away for a while. The TA's had instructions not to help with the code. The automated tester accepts successfully all top ten submissions no matter which random seed I tried and each method call has only one correct answer at all times. I think the problem may have been late starting and then not realizing that the project was not easy as they thought it would be.,2018-10-09T20:44:42.533,3908
13634,5123,0,That postmortem is a great idea. I will definitely instruct my TA's to do that in the next week's lab.,2018-10-09T20:50:52.910,3908
13635,5123,0,I saw situations like this in a college course I took in 1984: many students befuddled and unable to develop a working algorithm. We had no automated testing system and limited access to computer terminals (mainframe environment). As you say the info about *why* submissions failed is vital to figuring out the OPs problem. Coaching the students in incremental build and test would be valuable.,2018-10-09T21:21:59.947,5349
13636,5122,0,I have read the problem description carefully. I know how I would solve it with C or Assembly: a big bit array representing the integers from 0 to your specified max. I don't know Java but apparently C# is similar and I taught that. I do not understand the idea of 'operations' your M parameter. Either the program has consumed and processed all the input or it hasn't. A partially done answer is no answer at all and if student's algorithms produce different results for values of M insufficient to reach the final result you can hardly fail them for that. Discard the M parameter and try again.,2018-10-09T21:27:22.420,5349
13637,5122,3,I found the requirement description was difficult to understand - it seemed unnecessarily convoluted and artificial to me. It is possible that the students simply couldn't figure out what was expected since the final class should have been relatively simple.,2018-10-09T23:21:08.277,1537
13638,5113,0,You can pretty easily do a linked list.,2018-10-10T13:17:35.270,21
13639,5113,0,_@ncmathsadist Definitely but I wanted to introduce generics between array list and linked list so that we could start off using linked lists with generics. I'm happy with the pair example mentioned below - it went over well in class.,2018-10-10T13:49:04.050,830
13640,5122,1,Did you include any source material about Allen's Interval Algebra? Maybe that was the problem.,2018-10-10T22:45:31.827,5349
13641,5123,0,One other potential issue I would add to this answer somewhat related to the five week issue is that they just can't fathom the steps necessary to break this problem down. I see this all the time in my CS1 and CS2 courses even for less complex problems. I would either draw out a suggested timeline (e.g. complete X method by Friday Y method by Monday) or have a check in at some point in time. Depending on the number of TAs you have you could set up gitlab or something similar for students to check in their code periodically and the TAs to assess whether they are making progress.,2018-10-11T15:15:11.173,830
13642,5127,1,One of my favorite examples to show my intro students regarding string literals vs expressions is something like 12/12/10 could be representative of the date Dec. 12 2010 vs 12/12/10 is going to be 0.1.,2018-10-12T10:02:19.200,830
13643,547,0,I just want to add onto this remote example. I did an assignment for class where students were constructing interfaces/classes for a Samsung-esque company. So they had interfaces like `VoiceAssistant` that were then only implemented on some of their classes (e.g. smartphone smart assistant but not TVs). The students found it very effective!,2018-10-13T21:11:14.457,830
13644,5130,0,This is a really interesting perspective and something I have never heard in years of schooling. (which perhaps says something about the schooling) I always heard the oft-touted superclasses define commonalities subclasses define differences model. I'm going to have to sit on this and ponder it. If I'm understanding this correctly your perspective suggests that a non-abstract class should never extend another non-abstract class. Is this correct? Do you have any readings for me to pursue this further?,2018-10-13T22:19:53.980,830
13645,5130,1,Not exactly. You can extend a class without adding to it's public interface. You can add all of the private methods you like and you can change the behavior - to (hopefully) more specific behavior. So a Snake can _bite_. A RattleSnake can also _bite_ but it is more serious.,2018-10-13T22:22:41.543,1293
13646,5130,1,Think about whether you gain anything with your hierarchy over having Vehicle and Bicycle completely separate classes. Very little other than typing (hitting keys) I think. And you avoid most of the traps. It isn't typing (hitting keys) that makes programming hard.,2018-10-13T22:25:10.710,1293
13647,5130,0,A horn is a decorator as is a signal light or an arm signal.,2018-10-13T22:34:00.557,1537
13648,5130,0,Well @pojo-guy maybe not exactly but something like that. Use delegation not inheritance for such things. But yes see the Decorator Design Pattern.,2018-10-13T22:36:36.560,1293
13649,5130,0,_@Buffy Thank you both for the info. I'm going to ponder it and I might be back here with more questions.,2018-10-13T22:50:58.173,830
13650,5129,0,This is an incredibly simple and very nice answer. Thank you!,2018-10-14T07:52:40.077,150
13651,5129,0,_@ItamarG3 It also is fun to see how much your students really have thought about the zombie apocalypse... :),2018-10-14T18:46:18.577,830
13652,2702,0,I think there is nothing wrong with being exposed to lots of different languages and environments including non-programming things like Matlab a home-brew digital design simulator created by a prof a robot arm system created by another prof and so on. My first resume out of college had a list of languages in alphabetical order beginning with APL about 14 in total. Nothing shameful about that. I did earn money with C and eventually mastered it. But lex and yacc came in handy a few times. My solution was almost always develop a DSL for this problem and I didn't work much overtime ever.,2018-10-14T21:58:35.347,5349
13653,5130,0,_@Buffy A rattlesnake can also *rattle* though.,2018-10-15T12:54:46.687,27
13654,5130,0,_@BenI. and if you add that in a subclass then you have a bad design. You need to then make ad-hoc decisions about what you have - the very thing OO is designed to make unnecessary. Rethink your hierarchy. A sloppy design will pay you dividends later - in pain.,2018-10-15T13:04:45.757,1293
13655,5130,0,A remarkably bad design Point has a subclass Circle (just add a radius) which has a subclass Cylinder (just add a height). So now every  cylinder is just a point. If you have a variable w/ type Point what can you do with it? BTW in at least one book this is treated as GOOD design. If you need to know the most specific type of an object then the hierarchy does you no good at all. It is just noise that you may as well omit. The system can no longer help you and you need it all in your head at every statement.,2018-10-15T13:09:32.180,1293
13656,5130,0,_@BenI. maybe think of it this way. Is a snake that _doesn't_ rattle a more general kind of snake or just a _different_ kind of snake? If your snake hierarchy needs warning sounds add them at the top. Now you can distinguish by behavior not by interface.,2018-10-15T13:59:02.430,1293
13657,5133,1,These are all great points and after some discussions with students today I think the compile time/run time point is the biggest issue as my slides are very clear about producing a good mental model on the other points (i.e. a variable of type X references an object of type Y where Y extends X) and _most_ students seem to get that. Eclipse is the IDE of choice starting in CS2 but they don't seem to quite grok what the computer knows when. I'll have to see about squeezing in a longer discussion on that probably next semester.,2018-10-15T17:41:28.590,830
13658,5130,1,It is unfortunate that all the common examples of polymorphism - Animal Vehicle Shape etc. - are flawed. Maybe someone could collect up some good examples instead? There used to be a Question here about that.,2018-10-15T21:04:36.213,5349
13659,5130,0,_@ScottRowe most of those can be made to work for interface polymorphism but not for concrete (class) polymorphism. Note that the typical hierarchy of the animal kingdom is all abstract concepts. Mammal can't be instantiated nor can Vertebrate. Only the leaf nodes represent actual animals.,2018-10-15T21:08:07.133,1293
13662,5130,0,Actually there is no need to start at gates and low level stuff. But if you teach OO really really badly your students won't advance very far. My experience is quite long and deep. Note that people teaching functional programming are very unlikely to start at bits and bytes. But in general if you want to teach something well learn it _and_ its pedagogy. Don't just try to force fit it.,2018-10-15T23:55:44.587,1293
13663,384,0,Can you give us an update?,2018-10-16T01:26:05.533,283
13665,117,0,Technically html is an irregular subset case of sgml while xml is a compliant subset of sgml. Xhtml is a subset of sgml that is fully compliant with the xml  that implements the html concepts. Html is irregular to reduce bandwidth usage on slow acoustic modems and to minimize typing when web pages were all hand built,2018-10-16T02:43:50.653,1537
13666,384,0,_@EllenSpertus I'm sorry to say that my update is that I forgot about this entirely. In the interim I had a kid and have been rather distracted. I should still try it!,2018-10-16T03:20:38.857,27
13668,374,0,`I'm convinced students do not have the ability to resist using their computers to check facebook email MLB etc` Do keep in mind that these activities are easier to prove/observe than e.g. daydreaming or simply not paying attention and your comparison of the two options may be more skewed than you think it is.,2018-10-17T11:20:39.003,2164
13669,5141,0,Thanks Buffy The rotation solution is particularly inefficient. However in this case the problem size is small and is a don't care because it need only be fast enough for the human player not to be kept waiting. . Premature optimization is rarely a good thing. - Fritz,2018-10-17T19:01:15.297,4301
13670,558,0,_@SeanHoulihane but I am hoping that FedEx would in fact enforce their conditions because they don't want an entire truckload or plane cargohold of packages to burn up whether I cared (or perhaps intended that) or not. Caring to protect yourself and your users is the bottom line.,2018-10-17T20:39:00.233,5349
13671,5141,0,I actually encourage students to look on line for help and/or solutions. I  ask only that they cite the link where they found the code. And in doing so that they  assume responsibility for the code. Tough luck if it doesn't work. I also tend to introduce some structure not found in the online solutions so that students must at least adapt what they find to the requirements.,2018-10-17T21:01:08.090,4301
13672,2856,0,Domain Specific Languages have a lot of advantages and have existed since long before OOP came about. The biggest advantage from my point of view is that I can hand over a lot of 'programming' work to non-programmer domain experts including ordinary folks. My first goal as a programmer is to make my services no longer required. I used to be quite successful at that.,2018-10-17T21:06:21.683,5349
13674,5141,0,Actually I wasn't optimizing. I just think that brute force assignment is the _simplest_ solution here.,2018-10-17T22:44:43.500,1293
13675,5134,0,About #5: $0{\text{ }}log_{2} = \infty$ while $0=1{\text{ }}log_{2}$ so there ends up being some kind of special test for the empty square value or the stored value of zero. The conditionals around that problem makes it likely that choosing color based on cell value would be just as fast and less error-prone.,2018-10-18T01:05:27.400,104
13676,5137,0,I think this is a fine exercise to use in that it will avoid any preconceived notions of how the `object` should act based on its name. I does indeed form a good touch-point if used. Unfortunately for me it doesn't seem to directly address the OP's current problem. It can probably help to avoid the problem in the next term however so it does have value.,2018-10-18T01:39:18.823,104
13677,5137,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I respectfully disagree I think it's immediately practical. OP already acknowledged that they need to reteach at this point which is why I went for a clarifying nuts and bolts example.,2018-10-18T02:28:55.817,27
13679,558,0,_@ScottRowe Your desires are irrelevant to the interface. There are implications for misusing the interface but an interface which includes testing of its inputs is more expensive. Providing an un-validated interface may also be expensive (see GPZ vulnerabilities which use speculation and a cache side-channel) - this is reflected in your risk analysis.,2018-10-18T07:54:02.943,41
13681,5135,0,I think that answers to this question would be more useful if you could be explicit about *why* you have this question or equivalently what the *context* to the question is. Are you for example comparing two university courses to decide which to apply for?,2018-10-18T15:29:44.037,1219
13682,5135,0,_@PeterTaylor i am willing to save my valuable time :),2018-10-18T15:57:57.090,6062
13683,5134,0,Yes your are correct the empty cell being 0 is a special case but as an index works very nicely.  I would hope that the students would see that `array[cellValue]` is cleaner than a `switch` on the the `cellValue` with all the possible cases (`2 4 8 15 ...`). Perhaps you are correct that the students would be more comfortable with the `switch` approach. I had thought of this an a way to demonstrate allocating an `arrray` of constant values.,2018-10-18T18:45:47.903,4301
13684,5116,0,I do this by setting the project as a second monitor as a second monitor and extending the desktop then simply scoot my editor/ide/terminal window over.  Of course this also means I have to increase the font etc. but hey if I can't see it on the screen neither can my students.,2018-10-18T19:57:15.200,662
13689,5143,1,Surely she must understand the value of being able to store a data series and calculate its properties? Something as simple as calculating the mean might be a useful first step.,2018-10-19T17:20:59.307,6074
13691,5144,0,Welcome to CSEd! That's a nice first post :),2018-10-19T19:07:21.677,27
13692,5143,0,Maybe it's too simple and she need something more difficult to see how computing is a good way to solve the problem. That's what I'm wondering because I taugh  the basics ( find max/min count how many times the value 'x' is in the list how many elements verify a condition etc...) in order to make her more at ease manipulating datas. Maybe it's because I didn't link it to some sort of mathematical problem  that she can't see about the use of lists/arrays...,2018-10-19T22:36:50.817,6077
13693,5144,0,Good point about coding experience will help her find a job. It's true but I would like to show her that's it a real plus for her everyday life at her futur job.,2018-10-19T22:50:54.093,6077
13694,5145,0,She is at an age where she can't really see how important it is to have general knowledge.,2018-10-19T22:53:16.497,6077
13695,5146,0,Maybe in the next lessons as we have finished to learn lists basic nex step is to take a big problem and split it in simplier problems which she know how to solve divide and conquer ;) I plan to make her code a little tic tac toe game which can be a more fun way to manipulate lists.,2018-10-19T22:54:46.813,6077
13696,5145,0,I would think second year university is old enough actually. Perhaps she is too focused generally.,2018-10-19T22:55:26.110,1293
13697,5145,0,It's french system known as CPGE ( Classes Pr??paratoires aux Grandes Ecoles) with a lot of maths and physics a few computer science and a LOT of pressure. As computer science is not seen as a prerequisite or important subject for her that maybe why she can't see why I focus so much on making her being at ease with lists/arrays,2018-10-19T22:59:02.753,6077
13698,5147,0,Very well thought out answer thanks. It sounds like it might raise motivation in general but lagging students would have even more 'evidence' that the cause is lost? You also noted my point that I don't want people to find ways to game the system. Learning is not a game.,2018-10-20T00:12:37.227,5349
13701,5110,0,Just tell them that it is caused by **shared mutable state**. The pain of doing this will help you to re-consider your design.,2018-10-20T23:49:49.443,204

13704,5138,0,I think having 4 public `move` methods is cleaner than using a single one with a string parameter. At least use an `Enum`!,2018-10-24T01:53:31.540,5963
13705,5147,0,Students already do their best to game the education system. In a gamification system maybe it's more.in the open,2018-10-24T03:37:37.413,695
13706,5138,0,_@SolomonUcko I don't agree about the cleanliness in the public facing methods though I am referencing private methods so we're not far off there. I absolutely agree about the Enum. Thanks for pointing that out! Fixed that and I also noticed when I went in that my code wasn't formatting.  Apparently we now need 8 spaces to start a code block??  In any case that's fixed now too.,2018-10-24T12:45:12.387,27
13707,5138,0,I'd say that using an `Enum` parameter is better than using multiple methods which is better than using a `String`. Sorry for the tone of my previous comment I was in a bit of a hurry.,2018-10-24T13:26:30.357,5963
13708,5143,0,Re ...there?€?s somewhere an array (or an object) which stores your username password... IMO there's quite a difference between how you use an array (members are addressed by numeric index all have the same type) and an object (members accessed by name non-homogeneous types.),2018-10-24T20:52:27.887,1269
13709,5135,0,In a nutshell: Computer engineers design computing machinery. Computer scientists study the possibilities of what can be accomplished by using computing machinery.,2018-10-24T20:55:53.693,1269

13713,5160,0,In some languages you can index of lots of thing including a range of negatives or an enumeration type.,2018-10-27T00:44:48.387,1293
13714,5162,1,I've tried something like that but without the physical object. Scenario: we're both working late in the electronics lab and I forgot my calculator. I call out to you Hey Fred what's the square root of 4? You return the result of the computation It's 2! I called the function by name Fred passed a value and waited for a returned value. The function didn't care what problem I was solving and I the caller didn't care how the answer was computed.,2018-10-27T01:13:27.627,6112
13715,5159,0,Exactly I use pytest though it's simpler. pytest errors out if there is unexpected output when importing the module. The  problem is not in detecting their mistakes those are pretty obvious the real problem is that they persistently don't get it!,2018-10-27T01:18:23.530,6112
13716,5156,0,Hi IramShah welcome to CSEd!  I'm afraid that this question was closed because it's off-topic for our site which focuses on how to teach effectively within a computer science classroom.

13717,5111,1,5 year olds love the stacking hands game where the players interleave their hands in a stack then each player when his hand is one the bottom of the stack pulls it out and places it on the top of the stack. The players get faster and faster until there is just crazy slapping as everyone's hands collide. That is a race condition.,2018-10-27T02:32:26.940,1537

13719,5156,0,Yes I got the answer actually am confused or want to clear about topic.,2018-10-27T03:37:17.417,6071
13720,5163,0,I am sure to draw fire from the community by talking about *Software* in terms of real-world things instead of explaining it as a closed hermetic universe entirely consisting of concepts unrelated to anything the students have encountered before.,2018-10-27T14:39:01.587,5349
13721,5160,0,What are you trying to achieve with the negative index?,2018-10-27T18:43:18.683,6109
13722,5160,0,I am a student and all teachers tell us only about positive index in array. So there is a question in my mind that is it possible to gave negative index if yes the. How is it possible,2018-10-27T20:21:55.863,6071
13723,5157,0,Something that reads from stdin and writes to stdout (I am hopelessly dating myself here) is a good exercise. Next thing you know they'll be dealing with stream processing of big data.,2018-10-28T01:10:39.410,5349
13724,5160,0,In COBOL array indexes start at 1. Then the compiler under the covers converts the index to a zero based offset from a base pointer.,2018-10-28T02:17:21.920,1537
13725,5160,0,So its mean if I want to gave negative index number that start from -1 then firstly I should set compiler as I want ??,2018-10-28T03:46:16.313,6071
13726,5160,0,it means it's up to the language to decide what the index number really means. E.g. in python lists can have an index like my_list[-1] - which is the last element in the list.,2018-10-28T12:42:51.800,6109
13727,5160,2,Hi @IramShah welcome to [cseducators.se]! I'm afraid that I had to close this question as it is off-topic for the site. CSEd is mostly for teachers and it is about how to teach CS concepts. So a question about classroom practice would be topical here. However I see that you already received a good answer so I hope that you also got the help that you need!,2018-10-28T18:22:51.460,27
13728,5163,1,Bingo! And no you won't get flak from me for mixing electronics and software. I deal in embedded systems and a system diagram can be any of pure hardware pure software or a mix (e.g. state machine FPGA).,2018-10-28T18:59:34.863,6112
13729,5157,0,_@ScottRowe Hmm yes. In fact they will eventually be dealing with IoT concepts and aggregating data from multiple sensor things.,2018-10-28T19:11:21.160,6112

13735,5002,0,_@ScottRowe It would be nice to have your comment as answer.,2018-10-29T15:34:46.817,6109
13736,5168,1,That's a fascinating approach! Is this your first time using it?  What are the ages of the students?,2018-10-29T15:37:21.060,27
13737,5168,1,_@BenI. I'm doing this for seven years now with good success. This year one colleague of mine switched from java to the same concept because of the good results.  The students are first semester students in Germany at a university of applied science many without little to no background in cs and no programming experience (yes this is Germany in 2018 :-( ).,2018-10-29T15:39:38.433,6109
13738,5161,1,Re ...this makes address calculation very easy... That is a reason why arrays can be more efficiently implemented if the range of allowed indices is contiguous but it does not explain why that range should not include any negative numbers.,2018-10-29T19:51:28.357,1269
13739,5161,2,Re ...you might destroy other variable's content.  That is a reason why you should not use out-of-bounds array indices but it does not explain why negative numbers should be out-of-bounds.,2018-10-29T19:51:39.343,1269
13740,5161,1,There is no _strong_ reason why negative numbers typically are not allowed.  Probably the best reason is Many languages for simplicity's sake only allow the programmer to specify the size of an array rather than allowing the programmer to specify a starting and ending index. If you want to choose one starting index that will make everybody happy there are not very many reasonable choices.  Some programmers will grumble if you choose 0.  Some will grumble if you choose 1.  _Everybody_ will grumble (and nobody will use your language) if you choose any other number.,2018-10-29T20:01:12.527,1269
13741,5002,0,_@OBu my experience in giving answers like my comment is that they are not well-received by the community. The author here said he lacked some details so I provided them as we are meant to do with comments.,2018-10-29T20:48:05.060,5349
13742,5133,0,I personally find the term message to be both unnecessary and misleading. It doesn't align with my perception of real life at all. I don't send messages to my knife when I want to slice bread. I execute some action on the knife and bread. For me method call seems to be closer both to underlying logic and to real life analogy.,2018-10-29T21:15:32.310,4884
13743,5133,0,_@Frax actually you are quite mistaken. I'll add an annex to my answer to explain why.,2018-10-30T00:10:11.013,1293

13748,5133,0,I don't think I'm mistaken. I know very well how Java methods work. Yet I very much prefer to think about them as abstracted switch statements. The fact is that in vast majority of cases you know very well what is going to happen and all that object is in control OO-speak is kind of moot. Actually my Object Programming course presented switch statements and inheritance side-by-side simply as different solutions to the same problem with different trade-offs (cheap new methods versus cheap new behaviors).,2018-10-30T18:15:05.660,4884
13749,5161,2,Consider The principle of least surprise. Or minimum grumbling. Maybe negative indices would refer to imaginary data? Probably appropriate for quantum computing.,2018-10-31T12:14:08.547,5349
13750,5170,0,Thanks for the feedback but that's not really what I'm asking for.,2018-10-31T15:10:22.953,4689

13752,5168,2,_@OnorioCatenacci The good thing about C is that it uses nearly no magic behind the scenes and you can understand the behaviour once you understood how a computer works. But you have to give the students time to learn you should not hurry.,2018-10-31T17:02:20.147,6109
13753,5160,0,?€?Everything has to start somewhere?€?: if it starts at zero then it can not start at a negative number in the same way that it can not start at 42 (because it starts at zero).,2018-10-31T17:40:27.260,204
13754,5176,2,Excellent first question here.  Welcome to [cseducators.se]!,2018-11-02T13:49:08.900,27
13755,5176,1,number is not the foundation of all of the other stuff. It is just on interpretation of a sequence of bits. It is no more real than any other. Therefore consider starting at some other place.,2018-11-02T16:52:48.683,204
13756,5176,0,This may be of use https://csunplugged.org/en/topics/binary-numbers/ or https://classic.csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/,2018-11-02T16:54:21.990,204
13757,5176,0,What other number bases do we use in everyday life?,2018-11-02T16:55:16.420,204
13758,5177,2,I always wonder what number-base should the subscripts be written in.,2018-11-02T16:56:33.340,204
13760,4274,0,Other proof techniques like what?  :D  (But really?),2018-11-02T19:41:46.887,1103
13761,4274,1,_@Wildcard [proof by intimidation proof by eminent authority](http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/proof.html) etc. ;) More seriously there are proofs by contradiction and by construction in CS but proof by structural induction is the natural fit when so many proofs are precisely about structures which are defined recursively.,2018-11-02T19:52:59.383,1219
13762,5176,5,I'm not convinced that understanding base two numbers is a basic 21st century skill.  It is an _essential_ thing to know if you want to understand how electronic circuits can perform mathematical and logical functions but you can write an awful lot of computer software these days without even having a strong understanding of base 10 let alone other place-value number systems.,2018-11-02T21:34:06.707,1269
13763,5176,0,Different symbols may work well but it also might help to use a verbose notation like `0b11` = `0d3`. By making use of prefixes it could make it easier to grasp that those are the same value just written in different ways.,2018-11-03T02:16:08.337,6131
13764,5176,3,If you talk about 11 and 11 with grownups who are math literate there will still be confusion. You need an indication of the base if you're mixing bases: a little subscript *b* or *d* or something: $11_b$ versus $11_d$.,2018-11-03T03:55:49.127,1748
13765,5177,1,The subscripts shouldn't be numeric. They should be *b* and *d*. Binary and decimal.  Or else the word $1011_\text{two}$ $123_\text{ten}$.  Of course if they are numeric they must use some common understood base (like ten); if they use the indicated number's **own** base it will always uselessly be 10.,2018-11-03T03:59:07.190,1748
13767,5177,1,_@kaz if the preferred system is a single letter how would you deal with duodecimal? I could accept using the full word but there is no advantage there to the digits as the full word is also in decimal.,2018-11-03T15:38:11.333,27

13771,5176,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor Sure it's true that all computers just work on some sort of signals that represent some state and there is no inherent meaning. I can also say that computers don't need electricity because it's possible to build a computer that doesn't use electricity. Apart from such pedantry though a common and useful 'baseline abstraction' is the one where bits are aggregated to 8-bit bytes where strings are sequences of encoded numbers and bitmaps are arrays or matrices of 'pixels' each of which is 3 or 4 numbers. But that wasn't what my question was about.,2018-11-04T12:23:25.363,6129
13772,5176,1,_@Solomon Slow The point is not to give a 'programming' class; in fact the explicit goal is for it to *not* be a programming class. We have plenty of people who know how to write software without understanding numbers and some of that software is even useful; but in primary education we're concerned with teaching children foundations and concepts not with whipping them into CRUD app slingers asap. But again this is a wholly different discussion and one that is as old as CS departments themselves are for that matter.,2018-11-04T12:26:14.880,6129
13773,5176,0,_@Kaz fair enough and I think I should indeed do so when talking about this with adults. Thanks I hadn't really internalized that this would make a difference.,2018-11-04T12:27:28.243,6129
13774,5179,2,Thanks yes this seems like a good way to go in terms of giving someone an algorithm to do conversions. I'm not convinced though that it's a clear way to explain the concept of there being different number bases at all since I would still be talking in terms of 'count out 6' or 'count out 13'. But still I am going to try to work this into my preparation.,2018-11-04T12:29:15.207,6129
13775,5178,1,My children are 5 and 7 so they will be my guinea pigs :) Part of the challenge is that this is for a Montessori school with so-called 'vertical groups' i.e. children of ages 6-8 are in one classroom (so are children 4-5 and 9-11). So I might need to differentiate the material a bit for various sub-groups. I don't quite understand what you mean by 'tens frames' can you elaborate?,2018-11-04T12:31:45.323,6129
13776,5180,0,I'm working off a curriculum proposed by what is essentially 'the Dutch association for primary education' and they have an exercise in making bracelets. I was a bit hesitant about that though representing essentially 'something' and 'nothing' with two color but when I think about it it's no worse than using the symbols I described. So in your experience children were able to make the link between the concept of an 'on bit' and 'off bit' and the colors quite readily? 9th-12th grade that is ages 8-11 right?,2018-11-04T12:36:01.723,6129
13778,5177,2,I wasn't sure about whether this would be suitable for this age either but I'm working off a curriculum set by the Dutch association for primary education who put this material with this age bracket so I'm just going with it. The more I get into it though the more I start to see how this is basically a launching pad for tying together other things - like how do you represent 'strings' when all you have to work with are numbers (and base 2 numbers for that matter) or even higher level concepts like 'video' or anything else that can be represented by computers really.,2018-11-04T12:39:47.377,6129
13779,5180,1,9-12th is students 14-18 years old. The activity came from CSUnplugged and was meant for younger students but worked pretty well with the older students too.,2018-11-04T12:40:17.280,30
13780,5176,4,Additional thought: how many working programmers need to write 'sort' algorithms today? Yet one of the most basic 'CS unplugged' (i..e without using any electronics) exercises is to get a group to devise an algorithm to sort that group from shortest to tallest. It's not about job skills it's about conceptual understandings how things work. Another: how often do people today open up their computers? Yet letting them unscrew a case and look inside is very illuminating when you can point to various components that together make up a von Neumann architecture (even if you never use that term).,2018-11-04T12:42:51.733,6129
13781,5181,1,Actually this is at a Montessori school. I'm working with a few of the teachers who want to incorporate some of this into their curriculum although me I'm just a dad who is doing one or two short introduction sessions as a way to explore where to go from there. Montessori actually has a system with beads (and 'sticks' which are 10 beads and 'plates' which are 10 sticks) to teach about the importance of the place of a digit in a number. I'm hoping to find a way to tie in with that.,2018-11-04T12:47:08.847,6129

13784,5176,0,_@Roel algorithms are important (even if you never implement a sort). Other ways to see the bits (not as numbers) is fundamental (not implementation). See work of Ada of Lovelace for examples. Bits can represent images audio text ?€? and you don't have to go through number to explain it. See also Euclid for an example of an explanation of geometry without reference to number. (Numbers are over used in the teaching of maths in schools.),2018-11-04T12:59:26.247,204
13785,5178,0,Tens frames are size 10 grids (usually $2\times 5$) which the student fills in to visualize counting up to 10.

13786,5178,1,Oh I see it's an interesting concept and one I think would adapt well to counting in various bases. I will talk about this with the teachers see how it fits within the overall pedagogical math framework they use; I don't want to get in the way of how they teach basic counting of course.

13836,5206,1,You might also want to consider whether some but not all parents present is a viable situation. I think it adds a complication though not necessarily a blocking one.

13848,5214,0,I agree with your thoughts about interest concentration etc. of younger children. When I was 18 and 19 I was a summer day camp counsellor of kids 6-13 the first year I did photography. Very motivated older students made box cameras least motivated made one photogram and rushed back out of the darkroom hopefully not ruining other kids stuff. They printed from negatives I brought a No Dogs Allowed sign was strangely popular they all wanted to make one.

13857,5213,5,You have hit on something that needs to be shouted: much of what is available now as education is full of endless distraction. When I was 14 sitting at a PDP-11 terminal there were no ads.,2018-11-11T01:31:42.127,5349
13859,5219,0,I've go to second the Deep Freeze recommendation. It was in use as far back as 2004 by the largest community college district in the US. Having been a student a lab aide and doing IT support there I can say that it performed well and made everyone's life easier.

13868,5215,7,They must be comfortable typing (real typing not hunt and peck typing). Thats not even required for professional programmers I know an absurd amount of really good programmers that still can't properly type. Because programming isn't about typing fast its about thinking abstract and being able to see how things work together and being able to properly test stuff. Sure you need to write the software at some point - but thats hardly the most time consuming thing in programming *anything*.,2018-11-11T18:16:50.270,1086
13869,5216,1,Could you explain the concern a bit more?  I mean it sounds like your parents sent you to some programming classes from ages 7-to-9 and now as an adult you've found yourself disinterested in it - I understand that part.  But how do you get from having taken a few classes that you weren't interested in at a young age to the idea of complete social separation?  I mean that seems like a bit of a leap so perhaps there's a bit more to the argument?,2018-11-11T18:17:35.123,39
13871,5206,3,_@Buffy Just noting that the science doesn't claim it has stood up for a long time. Studies have found that children may be able to learn concepts and capability of complex reasoning that supposedly represented in more advanced stages with relative ease. is what you will find if you read up on it. Additionally there have been *a lot* of alternative better founded theories which are both more dynamic and more fluid. In general as an educator it's best to ignore those stages completely as it advises generalizations for a different culture and time.,2018-11-11T19:51:51.537,675
13872,5216,0,_@Nat Children frequently inherit their parents interests it might be sports religion or professional career. So they spend a lot of time doing something they might not be interested in themselves when they grow up and it will take a long time to realise that problem. The brain isn't fully developed until you are around 25 years old. Incidentally (but anecdotally) in my experience it is around 25 people realise they are not religious or don't want to work with what they study at school/university - they just did it because their parents steered them onto that path.,2018-11-11T19:52:32.707,6187
13873,5216,0,_@d-b Huh that's interesting.  My parents insisted on mass exposure to all sorts of things but left me to choose my own path.  I guess that I never personally felt limited by anything that I was exposed to; I mean I ended up not caring for a lot of different things and other things I liked but not enough to pursue.  So from this perspective I guess I found it hard to understand how exposure to something could be taken as limiting.  I suppose that the trick might be to ensure that children have plenty of options and freedom such that they make the important choices.,2018-11-11T20:07:20.397,39

Python's a good language to learn though C isn't intuitive enough for young-me to have learned. Too much memory management. If C allowed you to join strings easily without having to first calculate their size I'd be all for it... but it's that strings thing that's the problem. (And honestly the point of the language is that you can't just do string + string and have it auto-`malloc`.),2018-11-11T22:25:12.043,6174
13880,5206,0,_@DavidMulder Actually if you search for your quote you wind up at wikipedia. If you find the relevant section there and then go to the referenced articles you find that Piaget holds up very well as applied to this conversation. The first link (an abstract only) seems to refute the quote and the second indicates that it applies only to simpler tasks. I still say that you should consider what Piaget has to say about development before you plunge in to something like this.,2018-11-11T22:37:09.223,1293

13883,5216,2,_@Nat That's because the freedom of choice is there for you.  If parents gave choices to their kids and it is in the form of A B C but you must choose one then the choice is stacked and not valid because it can be none of them or all of them or even D E F etc...  Parents themselves need to know how to teach children how to choose.  Many do not do this properly.,2018-11-12T06:15:06.743,1285

13888,5215,1,_@forest That blog post is a rant and has no sources and the language used in it really doesn't help making a point. I do not disagree that touch typing certainly is beneficial - it is - but its a *very* small thing of what makes a great programmer/engineer. You can be an amazing programmer/software engineer without touch typing but the other way round doesn't work. being able to touch type doesn't make you a good programmer. teaching a kid to touch-type before teaching him to get results will most definitely make them lose interest before you get them hooked.,2018-11-12T10:05:08.840,1086

13892,5206,0,_@MasonWheeler I think it depends on the concepts: I was learning BASIC from age 4 with the help of the Usborne programming books writing DOS batch scripts a couple of years later and dabbling with Pascal but when I was 8 I tried learning C (from the famous book The C Primer); all was going well until pointers were introduced and I just couldn't wrap my head around them at that age. I didn't revisit the concept until about 10 years later! :-),2018-11-12T12:04:27.253,4047

13900,5208,0,I said guess and probably. I don't consider I was unusually bright or advanced (fairly bright and interested) so I therefore have a gut feeling many kids would also be Ok.

13908,5216,1,Silicon valley execs keep their kids away from computers as an overreaction to the fact that modern electronic devices (especially games) work really hard to give you a profound sense of accomplishment without you actually accomplishing anything of significance. This is addictive and distracting and a bad habit to fall into much like watching sports instead of playing them yourself. To be an excellent programmer though one must learn to think analytically and that is more effective when started younger. You can teach it without computers but taking apart clocks and cars gets expensive.,2018-11-12T22:50:57.320,2462
13913,5224,0,Interesting and true. I would need to teach both though and no scratch just JS HTML CSS. So from what age onwards are kids mixable with adults you think? 15?,2018-11-13T11:29:52.557,6090
13918,5215,1,_@Polygnome So you don't write documentation? Specs? Stories? You don't communicate through IMs seek/provide help on programming boards? Keep to-do lists design decisions abandoned decisions and reasons for them? I certainly don't spend a significant fraction of my work time typing *code*; most of the effort is on typing *other* things. Slow typer isn't a red flag because you can't push code fast enough. Don't fight the strawman. If you have a great programmer who's bad at typing I suspect it's because he keeps notes in writing - that's fine though somewhat harder to share/backup.,2018-11-13T12:35:53.447,1816
13919,5210,0,Effort that requires you to learn new things is a great way to learn new things. Do you think I learned to read because it was the right thing to do? Of course not - I learned to read so that I could read all the awesome stuff in books (and computers)! Math can be interesting on its own but you can learn it just as easily if you need it to solve a problem even if you don't have a liking of math. Don't underestimate the power of genuine curiosity :),2018-11-13T12:45:48.993,1816
13920,5215,0,_@Luaan Yes I do write them all the time. but I also read them all the time. Again I'm not saying you shouldn't learn to proper type - you should - but that its not the *most* important thing for a good programmer. I've seen people who can type very fast write an absolutely unintelligible mess because they simply were not able to communicate ideas properly. Good ability to express yourself being clear and concise and being able to read & understand what is written are all imho more important then how fast you can type. Focus on the most important things first. Touch typing comes later.,2018-11-13T13:58:44.207,1086
13921,5215,0,Touch typing should come _first_ as a prerequisite to using a computer. Now it's true a child isn't going to need to type as fast as a professional developer who submits bug reports writes documentation writes unit tests etc. but being a confident and fluent typist is important for computer activities in general.,2018-11-13T13:59:39.213,6182
13924,5204,0,Have you already planned course content? I honestly can't see you getting much done in that time. I don't mean this to criticize just to make sure that no one gets disappointed.  Of course if they all did lots of homework they would learn much more. Perhaps work them through a book or tutorial where you spend the first hour answering questions about the last assignment and the rest explaining the next?,2018-11-13T15:18:45.310,4116
13925,5233,1,Challenging yourself is good but I have doubts as to the value of code-golf style challenges.

13926,5224,0,_@Ska Kinda hard to give an exact age.  Some kids go off to college and are essentially mini-adults by age-10 while other people never reach adult-like maturity.  We could probably take a reasonable guess at population-averages but it seems unlikely that people inquiring about your class will represent a fair sampling of the population.  So it may have to be a case-by-case basis thing.,2018-11-14T17:14:25.450,39

13932,544,2,`public interface Edible { public boolean isEdible();`  I find this a very bad example for students. If a class has the `Edible` interface **it is therefore edible**. Not only should the boolean value be irrelevant it downright contradicts the meaning of assigning an interface to a class (it is edible because the interface is assigned but it's not edible because the boolean says it isn't). In most (common) cases the fact that you assign the interface is confirmation that the class _is_ Fooable. If it isn't Fooable then it shouldn't have the IFooable interface. [..],2018-11-15T13:17:19.097,2164
13933,544,1,[..] It also doesn't make sense to have an `eat()` method for something that's not edible. You're sullying the clear contract by having that boolean in the middle of it. The boolean (when false) can effectively negate the primary reason for the contract to exist in the first place.,2018-11-15T13:20:23.977,2164
13936,5242,1,I wonder actually if lots of languages is a good thing to do. As opposed to diving deeply into problem solving in a smaller set.

If they have Python for example then why Java at all?,2018-11-16T00:27:56.443,1293
13939,5242,0,_@Buffy our education is very applied and we try to teach the relevant programming languages for our domains.

13950,5242,0,_@Buffy The German bachelor starts after 12 or 13 years of school. It takes (usually) 7 semester and afterwards you can do a matter of science (3 semester) which is the entry qualification for a PhD. Many people leave after the bachelor of science to work in industry in our case maybe as programmer consultant product manager ...,2018-11-19T14:49:23.327,6109
13951,5242,0,And is it entirely focused on one subject or a generalist education? In the US a CS student studies lots of things other than CS such as history language etc. Only about a third of the program is actually CS focused. I think it may be different with you.,2018-11-19T14:54:09.517,1293
13952,5242,0,Here an undergrad might take ten courses in a year four of which might be CS. In the last year maybe a bit more. But no single term will consist of just CS. The major is usually about 15-18 term length courses out of about 40. Some places count differently but it amounts to about the same.,2018-11-19T15:01:03.567,1293
13953,5242,0,yes it's totally different! It's about 70-80% CS (including math formal languages ...) and 20-30% application domain specific but still with CS in mind (e.g. embedded programming quality systems applied to software engineering scientific writing). We assume (partially wrongly ;-) ) that things like history languages etc are fully covered at school.,2018-11-19T15:08:25.837,6109

13956,5254,0,I think this is off topic here and have voted to close so won't give a full answer. Companies however change what they use to develop software because the need change constantly and the quality of tools change as well.

13989,5274,0,Hi! I really appreciate you taking your time to answer my question.  I did not mean to blame my educators for my bad habits. I'm interested in becoming an educator myself so I put some thought in which didactive approaches of my educators has helped me to become a better programmer and which did not.   It is probably fair to say that this is entirely on me.,2018-12-01T08:32:54.307,6282
13990,5276,0,Do you think there is a difference when it comes to low vs high-level languages? In our Systems Programming course (where we use C) we've been encouraged to always compile our code every few lines to weed out syntax errors which become tedious to debug once the program is large enough.   I do think there is a difference between trying to find logic and syntax/semantics errors when it comes to compiling to check on the code.,2018-12-01T08:35:11.513,6282
13991,5276,0,In most IDEs syntax errors are highlighted even without any compilation. But it is useful to check whether a loop works as desired. And this is independent of the language.,2018-12-01T13:28:26.190,6109

14003,5282,1,That's my point. If your use case is to insert a lot of values and have the result sorted at the end it is better to insert at the end of the array (constant time for the structures I mention) and sort everything afterwards. Other wise the whole process takes O(N??) (N is the number of elements inserted). Of course the insertion of a single element is linear. Also OP asks specifically about arrays. In that case insertion also needs to move the rest of the elements to the right (which is also linear). So again it all depends on your use case.,2018-12-03T11:50:28.440,746

Unless forced to by management. I have seen other diagrams used some have proved useful. I have seen pseudo-code effectively used when it is much higher-level than the coding language. I have also seen it effective when the programmer is not fluent in the language they are coding it. Experts tend to use a language they know well as as pseudo code. There is no value in retaining this pseudocode except for the NEA.,2018-12-06T20:42:15.300,204

14078,5313,0,_@Buffy I think you are correct. Most job advertisements just list a bunch of skills. (They should read Bloom). However it may help them keep there job and to acquire these skills.

14088,4691,0,(Using terms in their generic CS senses:) You (per your first paragraph) eschew interface/abstract inheritance & only promote implementation/concrete inheritance. This is a limited & unusual view that to some extent fundamentally misunderstands what inheritance is & is for. A good book is [Kim's Foundations of Object-Oriented Programming Languages: Types and Semantics](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~kim/FOOLbook.html). (Unfortunately Wikipedia identifies (via redirection) interface inheritance with subtyping which is wrong which is in turn identified with subsumption which is wrong.),2018-12-19T22:43:53.280,2485
14089,4691,0,_@philipxy actually you are completely wrong about what I promote. I was merely responding to the OP. In fact I use and teach abstract/interface inheritance almost exclusively. Actually Kim is professor Bruce a friend of mine and I agree that he knows of which he speaks and write. And I'm not sure why you think that interface inheritance isn't sub typing (most OO languages would disagree) although introducing new public elements into a hierarchy is problematic whether you do it in the concrete or abstract hierarchy.,2018-12-19T22:54:15.430,1293
14090,4691,0,Re promote I explicitly & clearly was addressing your post. I cannot reconcile The problem is that these sorts of examples require [...] you to add additional public methods to the subclass. with your comment or its own restating re elements. I referenced a book I don't want to argue. Suggest you show your answer & these comments to Kim Bruce. Re interface inheritance vs subytyping compare to the Inheritance (object-oriented programming) article: Inheritance should not be confused with subtyping. Kim was a typo related to their home directory ~kim.,2018-12-20T00:39:57.073,2485

14093,5257,1,A lot of the problem with programming and computers being difficult is bad languages operating systems and windowing systems.

14094,5321,0,I disagree about line by line comments. It is in particular a terrible coding practice. If the code doesn't speak for itself it is broken. If the comments and code don't agree they are probably both wrong. If you do this as an active practice when demonstrating I fear that the students will want to take it up themselves. In professional circles using high level languages (not assembler) inline comments are considered to be a _code smell_. Don't encourage it. The solution is  (a) better names and (b) shorter functions/methods. Then all you need to comment is the intent using say javadoc.,2018-12-22T19:55:53.043,1293
14095,5321,0,_@Buffy I agree if the students are a bit more advanced. But for beginners it is helpful to explain basic concepts again. E.g. why is this a pointer or why do I have to check for a certain condition. Of course speaking names are a must!,2018-12-22T19:59:39.363,6109
14096,5321,0,You can do that without inline comments. Don't teach them to do things that you don't want them to do themselves. A hand written comment on an overlay isn't the same thing as an inline comment. But _teacher_ does it. Why shouldn't I?,2018-12-22T20:03:50.267,1293

14107,4761,0,_@paus I don't understand what you desire.  Stroustrup explicitly mentions Simula in his writings as a major influence. Java like Smalltalk (inspired by Kay) is a class-based language with objects on the heap.,2018-12-28T18:13:40.697,1293

14109,4761,1,I think that most of the students have an experience like the following: Once we tried to write something with our friends in the class on C++/Python/PHP as hard as we could and based on our experience we got it right. Although all my generation started from BASIC and Pascal I don't think that they had an impact on the understanding of deeper principles they only gave basic concepts. Other stuff we had to drink from industrial languages not educational ones.,2018-12-28T18:34:35.920,6387

14111,5329,2,Excellent answer welcome to [cseducators.se]. From a personal perspective I really appreciate the sharing of material and CC-licensing is even better. Kudos to enki as well for supporting both students and open source.,2018-12-29T02:19:19.053,104
14112,4761,0,>>>  I'll note that C++ was derived from Dijkstra's ideas primarily (via Simula) whereas Java's core concepts come from Alan Kay. ---------- Nope. In Java there is no such OOP like in Smalltalk. There is an implementation like in Simula77/C++. In Ruby we have something like Kay's ideas - objects are trying to send messages to each other.,2018-12-29T08:11:40.160,6387
14113,4761,0,_@paus sorry but you are wrong about Java. True that Ruby has a more pure implementation. But in Java like smalltalk objects are on the heap (not the stack) and are accessed via reference variables. And yes objects send messages to one another. Java has a C-like substrate of non-objects but its objects are like those of Smalltalk not those of Simula or C++. In C++ to get behavior like smalltalk (virtuality) you need to create an explicit pointer to an object (usually on the heap). You are missing something I think.,2018-12-29T11:31:17.090,1293
14115,4761,0,_@Buffy Java has the same table of methods like in C and the search for the called method is done through it. Not like I'm getting any message but for some responding 'I'm not able to do it'. Heap there or not - it's the detail of the runtime implementation. But how exactly the processing of messages is done - this is the implementation of the very principle of objectness and highly impact the idiomatics. And it's a huge gap between Java and SmallTalk unlike Java and C where the difference in the smartness of pointers. And Java has Simula-like OOP with less poor implementation than in C++,2018-12-30T12:11:05.830,6387
14116,4761,0,_@paus Finally I see the problem. You are in essence saying that since Java _variables_ have type that it is not Smalltalk like. True that Smalltalk has untyped variables but that isn't the central issue. The table of methods to which you refer in Java only tells the runtime how to find a method but _NOT what the method is_. The method itself is resolved at runtime through the object not through the reference. It permits a more efficient runtime and earlier (compile time) error discovery. See: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/5133/1293.,2018-12-30T13:35:37.587,1293
14117,4761,0,But having programmed in all of these languages the mental model of programming in Java is the same as that of Ruby and very unlike that of C++ or Simula. Of course the Ruby programmer need to take a bit more care that programs don't fail at runtime. But compile time method resolution is possible in Simula and is not in Java. You cannot in principle know by reading a Java program which method will be executed except in those cases in which you know the most specific type of the object. That is what polymorphism gives you. There isn't one table of methods there are several.,2018-12-30T13:39:46.770,1293
14118,4761,0,But Ruby still needs a way to do resolution. In this case something like a hash map rather than a table will do the job. So the essential difference is whether an offset into a table (owned by the object) or a key into a map is used for resolution. That isn't really very different.,2018-12-30T14:04:16.100,1293
14120,5333,0,I've given an answer but I wonder if I've missed something in your question that makes it harder.,2018-12-30T15:51:53.847,1293
14121,4761,0,_@Buffy polymorphism is available in C++ too. The gist is not to know which method is called. The gist is in how NOT to know. You are unconditionally sending messages to the object which only decides how to react to them. There is no any other way to check whether the object responds or not to the message - only through sending an additional message like describe what you are and what you can. In languages with the table of methods resolving is done by the compiler without any involvement of the object.  In Ruby you can intercept the call of the method what is Smalltalk-like in some sense.,2018-12-30T22:19:24.680,6387
14122,4761,0,_@paus yes I know about C++. But you need to use an explicit pointer to object to achieve it. Let me repeat the table used in Java only defines where the object can find the method. If you use the same code but it refers to different objects the table will be different as it is part of the object. The compiler can't resolve to the actual method. Only the object itself knows where its methods are and the object doesn't exist until runtime. And the reference to the object doesn't contain the most explicit type of the object. It is a runtime resolution not compile time. You are missing that.,2018-12-30T22:27:58.113,1293
14123,5325,0,Thanks for the interest and support - here's a link to what A+ is. Gypsy also wrote a great summary and overview. https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a,2018-12-31T04:30:16.440,3990
14124,5327,0,Thank you Gypsy. I am just kind of frustrated because I don't understand why I absolutely have to teach A+. I feel humiliated when I have to teach these kids something I don't know and their parents are paying so much tuition (tuition is 40000$) at this school for students with learning differences.,2018-12-31T04:31:27.290,3990
14125,5327,0,I would like to turn it into physical computing. I only know the important structure of the computer in an abstract sense - for example I don't know what SODIMM or DDR2 or DDR3 is but I did do Nand2Tetris so I could have students fill in diagrams of how RAM is just a bunch of registers and then you could replace memory inside those registers. But I am really lacking any real lesson plan or worksheets resources for implementing A+.,2018-12-31T04:33:53.050,3990
14126,5327,2,Frustration at having to teach a foreign subject is common. Especially with teacher shortages. (Maybe if they got a better pay there would be more teachers.) Learning the A+ material personally can't hurt you - you could save money when you don't need to call for support on your own computer.,2018-12-31T04:35:52.827,104
14127,5327,0,Frankly I can't get over the fact that I don't see A+ as real computer science and ultimately not super helpful for the students in the future and I can't help but think my admin had no idea what A+ was or why the previous teacher would include it in the curriculum for computer science. They probably just thought - oh wow kids building a computer and taking apart things. That would be awesome!,2018-12-31T04:37:18.323,3990
14128,5327,0,But what on earth does building a computer mean and how do I do it with 0 budget a bunch of old donated servers that are missing god knows what and 10 raspberry pis with only 5 functioning sets of keyboards and monitors? I think I am just going to come up with 5 months of lesson plans and tell my chair that I am not teaching this class next year. They are already aware of my issues with the course. I am going to teach APCSP instead next year which is right where I want to be because I hold a masters in computer science.,2018-12-31T04:38:41.557,3990
14129,5327,1,In any case while the transition from one discipline to another is different than your case one of the moderators had to switch from music to computer science. Perhaps you can stop into our chat room [The Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) and try catching up with @BenI for some general help with the switch.,2018-12-31T04:39:25.480,104
14130,5327,0,Sorry hope I don't sound arrogant. I don't mean to put down my school or department or previous teacher. I am just worried because I'm frantically trying to assemble lesson plans for 1/7 to 6/11 and I don't have a strong sense of what I want to do and I am trying to put the effort in now and not have anxiety-typed procrastination.,2018-12-31T04:41:44.190,3990
14131,5327,1,Sounds like you've got the right plan and attitude. One possible benefit to the A+ choice in your situation is that as a physical thing it has better potential to reach the ADHD students. Try finding the Meyers book I referenced from the embedded link. It should be available from your public library ILL if necessary and that won't affect the budget much at all.,2018-12-31T04:44:52.990,104
14133,4761,0,_@Buffy In Smalltalk the message is a string with names of the methods and names of the parameters. The object can forward it as a whole to another object for example and add a couple of parameters along the way. The closest analogy for that in C++ - RPC and other protobuf. I wrote the similar lib to connect independent parts of the program. In dynamically-typed languages it's done by transferring the table where keys are names of params. Objects are pointers in Java they're only in heap.  The closest analogy in C++ - shared_ptr but syntax overhead won't' make you happy.,2019-01-02T21:14:58.750,6387
14134,4761,0,_@paus. This reads like a very naive view of how an interpreter might work. You seem to have some serious misconceptions about how languages are translated and executed.,2019-01-02T21:34:17.417,1293
14135,4761,0,_@Buffy which one is interpreter among them? What exactly do you mean?,2019-01-02T21:42:40.580,6387
14136,5312,0,can you tell us more about your background? The situation you are describing sounds horrible to me (in every aspect).,2019-01-05T10:06:38.657,6109
14137,5341,1,See: [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/16088295/7412956) and CERN's notes on [Clink](https://root.cern.ch/cling). You can have a REPL for C++.,2019-01-06T09:26:01.220,104
14139,5341,0,_@GypsySpellweaver I thought this site is for both **teaching and learning** strategies.,2019-01-07T09:40:09.220,204
14140,5342,0,And tests should be automated and published so students know what they have to do and can test their own code.,2019-01-07T09:52:13.737,204
14141,5344,0,I can't remember the name of the study. But if you give sumative feedback (grades) then you negate formative feedback and learning. You can measure or you can teach you have to choose. It may be that you can separate these things.,2019-01-07T09:58:38.767,204
14142,5341,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor The site is as you say basically. The Q originally was about development strategies. It still seems more developer-oriented than education-oriented to me and could benefit from more focus.,2019-01-07T16:46:27.113,104
14143,5341,0,I disagree.  REPLs are extremely useful teaching tools. Java now has jshell and I find this tool to be extremely helpful.,2019-01-07T16:53:19.390,21
14145,5326,0,IMO the question is incomplete without a syllabus. E.g. I attended a 24-lecture course on databases which didn't include a single statement of SQL but other database courses might be primarily about SQL. Do you want the textbook to cover No-SQL databases? Do you want it to discuss the deviations from ANSI SQL of the major vendors? Etc. etc. etc.,2019-01-09T08:49:38.447,1219
14146,5348,7,Strings (an array of strings).  Compare fixed sized chars to varchar as in databases or C C++ or other language.,2019-01-10T15:26:44.193,3799
14147,5352,1,Hmmm. Perhaps as a thought experiment but not in the real world. I lived in the time of 24 hour turn-around and coding on a key-punch. No one should have to do anything like that. Fast turn around is a universally good thing for learning but you need different techniques today such as Test First. I've done it both ways. Don't even think about going back.  That said I don't use a REPL not because it is too fast but because it keeps an insufficient record of my work.,2019-01-10T21:54:09.950,1293
14148,5349,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se] and thank you for a nice anwer. Once you have enough [Reputation](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation) (20pts.) why don't you stop by the sites chatroom [The Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174) to discuss this but my sense here is that this would make a good question on its own. The concept of feedback doesn't work well in comments which are considered ephemeral here but could make good answers to a question. Not that it is not also a good answer to this question of course.,2019-01-10T22:12:05.723,104
14149,5352,0,Since you programmed in the time of key-punches you've already learned those lessons and don't need to go back.,2019-01-10T22:30:28.717,59
14150,5352,0,But I don't program like that in the modern age. I actually _learned_ something in the modern world.,2019-01-10T22:31:30.367,1293
14151,5351,0,It's quite obvious that a rectangular array would be a bad idea putting `Hubert Blaine Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff` in your rectangular array of names is going to put a hell of a lot of waste at the end of `John Doe`.,2019-01-11T00:16:21.217,990
14152,5356,0,Any references for learning the implementation?,2019-01-11T11:15:17.800,6434
14154,4902,0,I have worked in quite a few projects from academic high level project to pretty dumb applications never has the typing speed been a major factor in how good a developer was. Sure it's a factor but in most cases looking for that is optimising at the wrong place when other factors have a much higher impact. If all else is equal it might be something to consider but if the other hard abilities are the same I'd rather look for social skills as a deciding factor than the typing abilities. That's a mechanical trainable skill every good dev will find a way for it not to be a limiting factor.,2019-01-11T14:54:33.333,3039
14155,5342,0,Personally I think that if you are using an automated test suite those test should not be published. Using a website like gradescope you can allow students to run the tests as many times as they wish but the risk is that they just hard-code in the solutions to the individual test cases.,2019-01-11T22:27:24.680,6308
14156,3357,0,In the US there's also sometimes Pre-K which I guess would be -1.,2019-01-12T00:26:29.203,5963
14157,5360,4,These are great ideas for text-based games; that's what I was going to suggest but your list is more complete than mine would have been.  Welcome to the site; hope you stick around!  :),2019-01-12T01:29:44.420,1103
14158,5347,0,I really appreciate your answer I've been looking for awhile for a discussion like this one but haven't seemed to come across a good one. Your points are really insightful all three of them. I really like your first point especially that c++ has a long history and that it makes sense to study carefully major language features and understand the true reason why they exist. I also didn't realize that experienced c++ programmers spend so much time thinking about types. Do they use typedef very often?,2019-01-12T04:26:39.253,6417
14159,5345,0,Your point about TDD is well taken. It is hard however for a newcomer to begin writing tests when one doesn't know very much about how the language works.,2019-01-12T04:30:36.883,6417
14160,5347,0,One thing I forgot to mention is unit tests: if you write them this is an additional mechanism for fast feedback loop. Typedefs are useful indeed but in practice they are less useful since they don't introduce new types. Even if you say typedef int MyInt; you still can mix int and MyInt everywhere so here compiler won't help to find inconsistencies.,2019-01-12T08:52:53.737,6409
14161,3357,0,_@SolomonUcko same in UK (I love -1 indexed arrays),2019-01-12T09:22:59.060,204
14162,5358,0,Something short to keep in mind: not every GUI platform for Python works well together with proper scoping (there are famous libraries where the mainscreen is in the global scope and can't be encapsulated go figure). Keep in mind to check for such things if you want to teach your students to do it the right way since it appears that's important to you.,2019-01-12T14:06:57.193,1504
14163,5360,3,I disagree that debugging skills should be considered as independent learning. They should be covered by the course itself.,2019-01-12T17:49:40.693,660
14164,5363,3,This requires the students to understand all kinds of web techniques most notably HTTP and HTML which might be too advanced for freshmen students (without being the actual subject of the course). It makes more sense at a later stage of the curriculum when they already learned about network stuff.,2019-01-12T17:57:33.637,660
14165,5348,0,Spreadsheets? I know most are implemented as sparse arrays but the earliest were implemented with jagged arrays.,2019-01-12T18:46:22.023,1537
14166,5345,0,You have to teach test writing of course preferably with in-class demonstrations. Initially the tests can't be very sophisticated but they shouldn't be in any case. Prefer lots of simple tests over a few complex ones. This makes them easier to write and more useful as they give fine-grained error reporting. Note that tests are run as suites not individually. The tests in a suite are independent of one another. In Eclipse if you have a test for a non-existent method the IDE will write the stub for you so it makes things simpler.,2019-01-12T20:33:42.477,1293
14167,5361,1,Please say more about circuit python. An example would be good. What is  a cool demo or a cool interactive project?,2019-01-12T20:36:52.510,1293
14168,5363,0,How is a web app not a GUI? The client is quite graphic usually.,2019-01-12T21:22:16.850,1504
14169,5360,0,Ah I may have not been clear. I think that students should be explicitly taught the core skills that enable them to work independently and I included debugging in that list. I certainly don't think that students should have to learn debugging on their own. Rather that learning it enables them to be more independent.,2019-01-12T22:16:12.227,6308
14170,5363,0,_@mast with Python? the web app would be a GUI app (if its actually an app not an interface) but its not event driven like a standalone GUI app would be (or rather to make it event driven you would have to switch to Javascript) - so it would end up not teaching the students the same lessons (or language). I wouldn't say standalone GUIs are rare - remember cell phone games and tools as well as office applications are still typically stand-alones. Just depends on the field (like I will probably never write another serious webapp but GUIs? yeah all the time in C# with python backend),2019-01-13T04:05:00.180,6399
14171,5359,0,I've used [hour of code](https://hourofcode.com/ca/learn) for tools similar to the Greenroom (there are some college level materials and some of the games are great practice sessions for college students think 15-20 min instead of 4x45 minute lessons) - I've specifically used [these games](https://codecombat.com/teachers/hour-of-code) to teach event-driven programming for a web/phone based course I helped with,2019-01-13T04:31:29.017,6399
14172,5363,0,_@JGreenwell thats what I was getting at. Creating the actual GUI for those apps is often not done with Python. The skills to build a web app may be outside the scope of a freshman curriculum but you should not forget that this is probably why those students signed up for Computer Science in the first place; to learn mainstream app building techniques. I doubt they signed up because they wanted to learn algorithms. And both Flask and Django are easy enough to learn from the tutorials I posted I taught myself both using these.,2019-01-13T10:58:17.113,6439
14173,5361,0,Depends on the scope of the class so I'd say it's up to the OP. My point really is that building something practical and hands on can help ground programming. Turning LEDs different colors at the touch of a button or having them activate based on a particular level of sound or light can help turn more abstract concepts into something tangible.,2019-01-13T15:43:58.730,6435
14174,5302,0,**Unit tests** should **test the units** of the program not just the whole thing. Therefore students can write sub-parts and pass tests and therefore get grades.,2019-01-13T16:28:00.553,204
14179,5137,1,_@BenI. This example is a good point. I did used to use the common example of an abstract Shape class that has various concrete subclasses (e.g. Oval Rectangle) and then a data structure that contains Shape objects and prints out the name of the shape area etc. It does give some good intuition about how it all works.,2019-01-15T19:22:09.540,830
14186,5328,0,I have used resources from these they are definitely good quality.,2019-01-19T16:44:31.420,5349
14187,5339,0,A course may have mixed objectives. For example when given an assignment to sort an array the student may struggle with the development environment the algorithm the syntax the analysis of the problem writing test data naming variables programming structure proper indenting of code and of course the programming paradigm. The course must have a specific set of objectives and using these objectives the marking can be set accordingly by giving the appropriate weight to each of the above factors.,2019-01-20T02:17:48.443,6463
14202,691,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor so the year zero was part of the -1th century? Or was the first century 101 years long? That's a cool fact.,2019-01-25T13:31:00.500,799
14203,5373,0,I guess this question might belong on math-educators since I'm teaching in the math dept but I figured CS educators would be more likely to know this. Feel free to migrate.,2019-01-25T18:16:12.460,6485
14204,5373,0,Also is there a tag like `libraries` I should be using? Or would someone please create one? Thanks!,2019-01-25T18:16:38.757,6485
14205,5373,0,This isn't in my wheelhouse but it is certainly topical here.,2019-01-25T18:39:30.877,27
14206,5373,1,Unfortunately a bit specialized for this audience. I wonder if StackOverflow might be a better place to find people with their heads deep in the libraries. But I also wonder why you want this. Do you intend for students to explore the code? That might be worth doing though library code might be a bit messy with specialized bits and pieces obscuring the algorithm.,2019-01-25T19:01:09.997,1293
14207,5373,1,Is there any particular reason why you need a large list of libraries? Over here we're generally helpful with questions about lesson plans teaching techniques and things like that but we generally aren't good with questions like this since we aren't necessarily knowledgeable about practical CS. If you could give some context about the lesson you're trying to use this list in we could probably be much more helpful. However if you just need this list it'd probably be best for you to try another site since we don't really  have the experts to answer this.,2019-01-25T20:15:57.363,58
14208,5371,1,I used to co-teach with another instructor we would alternate about every month so one would prepare while the other was teaching. Our approaches were very different. Your approach sounds like hers: carefully worked out lectures with notes and quizlets afterward requiring design work before coding and so on. Mine was more lazzes-faire: just turn in your solution and I will give feedback. Both worked. Neither seemed substantially better than the other. You can lead a student to water but you can't make him (or her) think. It would be good if my former coworker was around to answer you.,2019-01-26T00:58:02.333,5349
14209,5374,0,Wow what a lovely answer!,2019-01-26T01:57:06.790,5349
14210,5372,0,Sleep is the most important factor in retaining learning. We always know things better the next day. They make more sense the second time we look at them.,2019-01-26T01:59:29.717,5349
14211,691,1,_@Karnat Good question. No there rely was no year zero I see my comment was not clear but not only was the first year year 1 the year before was year -1 (no year zero). The person that invented it did not know about zero. So we get -3 -2 -1 1 2 3. Dates and time are hard  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O4mYiP2zPQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY,2019-01-26T09:17:58.627,204
14212,5373,0,As others have noted this is a highly specialized question. Even though I have been using image libraries for decades in the practical sense and have probably used the algorithm I have never heard of the Paeth algorithm until now. Users of libraries typically don't look beyond will it do what I need? And how do I make it work?,2019-01-26T13:28:11.480,1537
14213,5372,0,_@ScottRowe I think the statement about sleep is too strong. True however that the mind works even when we don't force it so a period of rest can be useful. Reinforcement and feedback are probably more important however.,2019-01-27T15:03:00.870,1293
14214,4075,0,A forum is great for an online course but doesn't curtail spurious questions when the instructor is sitting 5 feet away much of the time.,2019-01-27T18:01:50.480,5349
14215,4073,0,Often the students deflected from asking the instructor who was 5 feet away to the student next to them who was 3 feet away. This can become a bigger problem. The issue is to develop better habits and independence not create blocks and hoops to jump through.,2019-01-27T18:04:00.107,5349
14216,4023,0,This should be the accepted answer. It refers to getting the students to be more self-directed.,2019-01-27T18:08:51.423,5349
14217,4019,0,When I was a TA in an intro programming course for non-majors lon ago this is what I tended to do. For a much more complex situation I think it would be like a game of pin the tail on the donkey.,2019-01-27T18:11:17.680,5349
14218,4016,0,With constantly new material of ever greater complexity like Console OO Windows Forms then databases then ADO then ASP there is no basis for general problem-solving and background knowledge. So the questions keep coming.,2019-01-27T18:14:06.047,5349
14219,4014,0,There are two general cases: 1) they could figure it out if they tried 2) there is no way in the world that they will figure it out because it is some arcane particular thing that they don't really need to learn forever but it is blocking them. It would be good if they could distinguish these and act appropriately.,2019-01-27T18:18:21.310,5349
14220,4010,0,When I was in college snow days were when I learned the most because I didn't want to walk to the terminal rooms. I spent more time looking at a printout of my code.,2019-01-27T18:24:07.037,5349
14221,5373,0,One more thought: I would assume that most image processing libraries are rotating using other algorithms due to interpolation issues but I'm not really an expert in this field so I might be wrong.,2019-01-28T08:00:40.377,6109
14222,5378,0,I'm not sure I entirely agree with you in any case but my context is rather different than you are suggesting. I teach in a High School. Not only is having kids simply leave is not an option permitting even a small number of kids to be visibly unfocused during my class time gets me in trouble with my administration and jeopardizes my career. This isn't NIMBYism this is keeping my job.,2019-01-29T18:05:24.380,27
14223,5379,5,Hi Allison welcome to [cseducators.se]!  Could you add in a bit of detail about what sorts of things were covered in those 3-7 years?  That sounds like enough time to cover AP CS A and then some.  Also what are the ages of the students?  Sophomores?  Seniors?  Freshmen?,2019-01-31T01:34:57.933,27
14225,5379,1,Are there some books/curricula you?€?re considering? Have you done some research already? More context will help yield some better answers.,2019-01-31T18:53:05.897,76
14227,5383,0,Hey I just wanted to let you know that if you'd like to chat with some of the other folks in our community there's a [chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) where you can do that.

14253,5382,0,_@MichelBillaud It doesn't appear to be a statistically significant result: The percentage of passing students appears to be lower for C (61.1%) and C++ (56.2%) however the differ- ences are not significantly different to the other languages whose pass rates are in the range 65% to 75%. This result is consistent with the work of [2] who also found no significant differences in pass rates based upon the language taught.,2019-02-09T23:27:25.017,27

14256,5382,0,I'm a bit puzzled by these remarks in the paper considering fig 5. where C++ has say 39 % non pass rate and Python has 26.  With such figures I'm a bit reluctant to agree with  In Figure 5 it can be seen that the mean percentage of non-passing students does not vary considerably by programming language.

14275,5408,1,The perceived flatness/shallowness of Vue might be a bonus for your purposes.

14276,5408,1,While I can completely understand not wanting to set your students up for failure with a subpar framework 50-60 minutes with any of those (or any ones not on your list for that matter) should tell them (or you!) real quick whether or not it will cut the mustard for their purposes (or is suited to them personally: I fell in love with React immediately and to this day still cannot force myself to make a non-toy Angular app).,2019-02-15T16:48:12.533,1790

14280,5411,0,I have been coaching a student that has been given lab work with unit tests to pass. While I agree that this is a good idea we found that we had to write our own tests. To do TDD: you have to keep asking what is the next test?; What test will lead to the simplest next step? I don't know if this can be predicted. If we make a different choice then the next choices start to diverge event though we end up passing all the tests in the end.,2019-02-16T16:10:40.077,204
14283,5409,2,What you describe is (or close to) flipped learning/class-room. Why do we not do it. I think it comes down to economics: We are paid to teach so we teach (badly). We are afraid that if we make our-selfs not need then we will not be needed. This is however not true you will still be needed. Have a read about flipped class room.,2019-02-16T16:55:25.383,204

14289,5411,0,Why not have all students write testcases and award a grade for each one based on how the other students who answer it get on? If it has no errors then a full grade less for errors. Have a set period of time for the writing activity then move to students solving them - by then there should be so many that each student gets a random selection to answer.,2019-02-16T20:02:01.287,6556
14290,5419,17,+1 especially for the last sentence. I think programming will change enough to make design patterns obsolete in much less than the 40 to 50 years of a human career. Knowing how to learn and adjust to changes will go on being useful.,2019-02-17T00:41:40.130,6558
14291,5417,84,Better than average I would say!,2019-02-17T01:20:52.213,1970
14293,5417,43,In my experience learning design patterns in school was pointless.  Worse than pointless actually; some of the students listened to their professors and started using them in their jobs :)  Lots of computer scientists in academia have very little real world software engineering experience because it's not their job to be software engineers.  They construct their theory build their proof of concept and publish their work leaving the work of commercialization to others.  Learn the theory in school learn the engineering on the job.,2019-02-17T03:50:26.343,6560
14294,5418,5,The last paragraph here doesn't seem to make a lot of sense as to its necessity here. The OP is not saying that a good CS program should _only_ include design patterns but that for _missing_ that _one_ component it is _worse off_ (not _a failure_ but _reduced_ i.e. _incrementally_ in quality - in fact the words reduce the quality were the exact ones used) than a program that would have included it. Just like one skimping on algorithms or on any of the other components you mentioned there would be a worse off program than one that did not skimp.,2019-02-17T04:21:26.183,4693
14295,5418,1,Or in simple terms a CS program must include much more than _just_ design patterns but if you take a program that is '_just_' that much more and compare it to another program that is 'just' that much more _plus_ design patterns it would seem the latter would be a better/more comprehensive program than the former. Moreover especially if the latter program teaches you the _thinking_ behind the patterns which I'd think more important than the specifics themselves as that is how you will truly understand _why_ they are used and _when_ to use them.,2019-02-17T04:24:36.437,4693
14298,5417,55,*problems in the real world both in academia and in the industry can be more easily handled with a good choice of design pattern* - I'd disagree with this way of thinking and recommend reading this for a different view: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/227880  - Overall learning patterns often isn't useful to an undergraduate or junior programmer and could even be counter-productive if it results in re-enforcing a misguided way of thinking about OO design.  It's far better to focus on the underlying software design principles such as 'SOLID' and 'GRASP' instead.,2019-02-17T08:21:15.320,6562
14299,5418,6,As a specific example one of the more famous patterns is a singleton. If you use java or the likes this requires a particular combination of static pointers and private constructors to do properly. However if you are working with the language Scala singleton is built in. You make a class as usual but call it an object rather than a class and everything works. This is why it is more important to learn to think about concepts like I want this exactly once than the detail in a particular language. Barring experience a good CS degree would leave you equally prepared to learn any language.,2019-02-17T08:24:17.553,6563
14301,5418,7,It would be amazing if a course taught both the OOP design patterns and the missing features that they replace (e.g. visitor pattern <--> double or multiple dispatch etc).,2019-02-17T12:27:50.473,2793
14302,5421,2,Hi welcome to [cseducators.se]! For those unfamiliar with the Udacity code review process (such as myself) could you give a bit of information about what it's like? You'll be more likely to get helpful answers this way.,2019-02-17T12:27:59.600,27
14303,5424,1,Your last statement is problematic. I could certainly mention them in one lesson and I might be able to cover them. But I wouldn't be able to actually _teach_ them. Maybe that is the level of discussion that the OP is complaining about.,2019-02-17T13:40:25.343,1293
14304,5417,47,In computer science as in every other endeavour snake oil is not a substitute for thought. Design patterns are not *necessarily* snake oil but they are often used that way. See many answers on the programming forums here for examples of the best way to do something by replacing 5 lines of straightforward code with 100 lines that conform better to the latest (often half-understood) whims and fancies of the currently fashionable software design gurus. Of course if your productivity is measured by LOC (more snake oil of course) then longer is better by definition!,2019-02-17T13:41:17.427,1352
14305,5421,1,I've been thinking a bit about it and I have some possible ideas but I'm not sure what you're looking for.  Could you edit your question and clarify?,2019-02-17T14:09:09.110,27
14306,5418,1,There are lots of things that could be taught in addition to the existing curriculum but at some point we'd have to acknowledge that we need more time to do so. University gives you the theoretical background to read up on the things that didn't fit.,2019-02-17T16:34:30.277,3138
14309,5418,10,Not just primarily C++. Gang of Four design patterns are inextricably linked to C++. Whilst some of the concepts (e.g. multiple dispatch) are common across OO architectures the Gang of Four patterns are purely C++ *implementations* of those higher concepts. It's notable that the patterns only cover features absent from C++ and do not start from the elemental features of OO such as member data and functions.,2019-02-17T21:07:43.943,1864
14310,5417,3,Note: The original design patterns boot has about 20 patterns and states that this is all there are. It also discusses MVC but does not list this as a pattern. The book that inspired this one ?€?A Pattern Language?€? ?€? Christopher Alexander has about 250 patterns and states that this is not them all there are many others. This book is worth a read (When you have some experience). As are the other 2 in the series (?€?The Timeless Way of Building?€? and ?€?the Oregon Experiment?€?)  You should also read his later works ?€?The Nature of Order?€?,2019-02-17T23:33:46.297,204

14312,5426,3,*It teaches you to look at the problem in terms of a predefined set of solutions* - ohh this reminds me of applicants I interviewed who could easily put together a Java application which skimmed some famous website for data presented it in a nice UI and did other interesting things by combining the perfect free libraries for the task but utterly failed fizzbuzz-style tasks. I've even seen one who couldn't write a code to determine which one of 3 integers is the largest. He couldn't find the library which would do it for him.,2019-02-18T07:13:05.313,4999
14313,5417,20,_@alephzero I think that *cargo cult* is a better analogy here than snake oil.,2019-02-18T09:12:52.463,1219
14314,5417,2,As a senior programmer with 17 years of experience I can already tell that you're expecting way too much from your CS course. University programming education is more of a hobby with very little relevance to industry. Programming for style is not at all what programming for money is. Sit back and enjoy the course while it lasts but your actual education will start with your first job - and will never end since then.,2019-02-18T11:07:33.703,2800
14315,5417,10,Speaking as a programmer with 40 years of experience what's a design pattern?,2019-02-18T13:12:39.733,4511
14316,5417,5,_@PeterTaylor It's cargo cult for the honest folk and snake oil for the shifty guys :P,2019-02-18T13:46:57.193,1816
14317,5419,2,To be fair there's plenty of university courses that are also evolving very quickly (e.g. chemical engineering) that handle it better. To me it (sadly) seems that many CS courses are done just for the form rather than the essence - it's important to have a CS course so we have a CS course. It doesn't have any real purpose you see but... It's also disturbingly common to see people who have no real-world experience teach various aspects of CS. It reminds me of Feynman's famous reflection on the quality of Brazilian university education back in the day :),2019-02-18T13:53:24.173,1816
14318,5419,2,Even worse many of the things that are being touted as the best and brightest today are things that were developed decades ago. The good CS courses didn't have to change any of the fundamentals because the fundamentals didn't change since the first ideas of electronic computers. Only the details change (as important as those details are mind you). The only courses that need to change much are those that are either *actually* bleeding edge or were more concerned with day-to-day practicalities rather than the actual science (for better *and* worse mind you).,2019-02-18T13:55:38.400,1816
14319,5426,3,_@vsz To be fair it's not like there isn't a market for those kinds of guys :) In the end you've got a job to do - and if you can do it better good for you. Some jobs require you to be good at analytical thinking and comparing integers; for some the issues are purely academic. Hey it's not like any other engineering discipline has it any different - it's just that software engineering just isn't quite mature in that way yet and we still expect every software engineer to be able to (with some training and experience) replace any other software engineer.,2019-02-18T14:00:43.283,1816
14320,5427,1,I'd argue it *was* a problem-solving tool - or rather when you realized Oh this looks like a Visitor you could go to the ready library of visitor-implementations to avoid having to write everything again with a new set of mistakes in the implementation.,2019-02-18T14:05:07.330,1816
14321,5427,0,_@Luaan Well that may be true at the implementation layer. I'm talking about the design layer :),2019-02-18T14:25:03.510,4731
14322,5417,5,Honestly I would say that design patterns warrant at most one optional course in a CS degree and at that it would be *theory* of design patterns rather than any concrete example. Most design patterns are heavily linked to a particular language and some languages flat out don't have any design patterns or have at most one that covers everything. It after all a CS degree and not a programming certification.,2019-02-18T17:59:27.127,6585

14326,5417,2,_@alephzero I think that design patterns have their place but their real purpose is unfortunately frequently misunderstood and their importance often exaggerated see also [this discussion on softwareengineering.se](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/9219/).,2019-02-18T19:01:24.650,154
14327,5417,3,The advice in the Jargon File for new hackers to learn a LISP (for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it) is relevant here. What a C++ developer needs to codify as design patterns are merely macros in a LISP and can be thus used as library functions with no need to reimplement them over and over.,2019-02-18T20:51:24.003,5084
14328,5427,2,I came to say this and you saved me typing.  As for ready library of visitor implementations; in my experience only if you are already committed to some framework.  I mean imagine importing Qt just to add signals and slots to your application.  Possibly this is different in framework languages like Java/C#.,2019-02-18T21:21:51.260,978
14329,5417,4,_@BenCottrell SOLID and GRASP are just as harmful as any design pattern. They result in the same sort of dogmatism that leads to nightmare code. The only valid metric of code quality is what-the-hecks per minute.,2019-02-19T01:25:16.067,981
14330,3387,1,Especially ditto for emacs. It's really another language. Sublime ... no problem. Acts like an editor.,2019-02-19T03:07:35.893,6588
14331,5418,2,_@Josiah : True but to me in this case design patterns _is_ about concepts. It's not merely about how they can be implemented - and even then learning how they are gives you an idea of what is going on under the hood even if you're using a language where that you don't have to actually write that implementation yourself as it's provided for you. If you don't know what a singleton _is_  when it's useful when it should _not_ be used _why_ that is and so forth then it doesn't matter whether the language has it or not. And _that_  imo is what a good DP course should cover.,2019-02-19T03:46:58.003,4693
14336,5347,1,_@AllenWang typedef isn't very common because it *only* creates a new name for a type. This can be useful as a mneumonic device but the compiler won't catch mistakes. If you need a new type define it as a class or a struct with the proper member functions. Also: look into templates. Templates are far more powerful than generics in Java and they preserve type information (so you can call overloaded functions). In many cases templates can completely replace the need for an inheritance heirarchy,2019-02-19T07:32:45.663,4233
14337,5417,3,_@jpmc26 I think you may misunderstand SOLID and GRASP - they are merely sets of principles (i.e. guidelines) and not rules to be followed dogmatically as you suggest -- quite the opposite in fact they aren't measurable nor can they be defined in any objective terms if someone happens to treat them this way then they've completely missed the point of those principles which I can well believe would lead to nightmare code but only as a result of plainly misunderstanding what those principles are and why they exist rather than as a consequence of following their advice.,2019-02-19T12:52:20.950,6562
14338,5433,0,If you can reach them from any machine the front page has links to the pages on which you can raise issues. Ask them there. Every such site will have its own policies of course.,2019-02-19T13:16:55.633,1293
14339,5417,1,Reading [The Perils of Java Schools](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/) by Joel Spolsky (one of the cofounders of Stack Exchange) leads me to believe that it is potentially a sign of *quality* to not have such a class. Outside of the over-engineered Java (or C++) world such things don't play such a prominent role (which isn't to say that they play no role).,2019-02-19T13:24:34.067,2715
14340,5417,5,FWIW: I took my SE class in 1988 before Design Patterns were A Thing and people still seem to accept that my degree is a valid CS degree.,2019-02-19T15:10:33.820,1139
14342,5434,2,Your general advice (don't worry about it) is sound. But the specifics are deeply flawed. Don't criticize patterns because they don't do anything _new_. That is an intended characteristic of patterns. _Capture good practice in an easily transferrable way_. They are explicitly NOT about invention. You are wrong specifically about singleton (as is much of the linked post). There are applications in which singletons are required. Don't criticize them just because some people misuse them badly. The are _not_ a hack to get globals. They are needed when _logically_ there is only one instance.,2019-02-19T15:54:22.513,1293
14344,5434,1,_@Buffy - Heh. Disagreeing with an accepted SO post that has over a **thousand** upvotes (and only 25 down). Ballsy that. You're horribly wrong but I give you points for taking a stand. I'll tell you that we found out how right that post was the hard way. But some of us only learn that way.,2019-02-19T16:25:21.817,1139
14345,5434,3,On the other hand I've been a member of the patterns community since GOF was issued. I'm also one of the few to know that GOF wasn't actually the _first_ patterns book though it was the first to use the name in such a public way. The wisdom of crowds sometimes isn't of course.,2019-02-19T16:32:50.723,1293
14346,5434,0,_@Buffy - However in this case the crowd is spot on. Singletons destroy testability and make future design tweaks really problematic for no good reason. If you only want one in your current design [only make one](https://codeahoy.com/2016/05/27/avoid-singletons-to-write-testable-code/). Problem solved. And now when you need to write unit tests or discover three years from now that you need two copies of the entire application running at once its not a gigantic self-inflicted redesign problem.,2019-02-19T16:43:10.737,1139
14347,5434,2,Patterns capture design decisions for the future as well as the present. Yes I only create one. Some future maintainer might not _remember_ all of the design decisions previously made. So in good software we try to capture those decisions so that they aren't easy to subvert - especially by accident. Enums do a similar sort of thing. Build your software do that you don't need to keep every decision in your head perpetually and expect that others will have the same understanding.,2019-02-19T16:52:30.163,1293
14348,5435,0,Wow is this actually a thing? Never considered it could be on the school's end. That seems so counterintuitive though if it's a classroom for teaching programming shouldn't they expect teachers to guide many students at a time to use the same online tools or services hence the same websites? But then I'm just an outsider educator teaching a government course hosted by a university so I'm unfamiliar with how university IT people govern their network. But this could explain that problem I experienced.,2019-02-19T17:18:53.693,6591
14350,5435,0,I don't think it was our school network directly. Pretty sure it was the filtering service that we subscribed to so the students could be safe.,2019-02-19T18:02:24.780,30
14351,3378,0,Another advantage of an editor is the ability to just get something on paper without worrying about any syntax. In using an IDE (which I do but also use editors) I am sometimes put off by all the errors that are a result of just typing thoughts and structure. Yes IDE I know it isn't syntactically correct but I don't care. I'll deal with that later.,2019-02-19T19:33:56.033,6432
14352,5418,0,_@The_Sympathizer I feel like that would be more of a Design class rather than a Design Patterns and said Design Patterns class would be more applicable to software engineering than computer science.,2019-02-19T20:47:36.237,3777
14355,5436,0,It's just possible that I know the person who taught your course. A friend taught there about then and was influential in the patterns community. But today I wouldn't make it a separate course. You would just learn the techniques in CS1 CS2 while learning to program assuming it was in an OO language. A real OO design course would normally be at a higher level than the GOF patterns. There are real architectural patterns of course.,2019-02-19T21:39:28.853,1293
14356,5436,0,_@Buffy - Our design patterns elective was a 400 level coarse. Our professor was actually a software architect at Disney who flew down once a week just to teach the one class.,2019-02-19T22:20:49.457,6598
14357,5434,0,Design Patterns are simply a common set of names for practices we all figured out ourselves at some point (or would figure out once we needed them).  If I called my thing a singleton and you called it a controlled-instance we wouldn't make much headway in conversation. They also tend to show implementation details you may not have thought of.  You can design without them but if you are working on a team you will have difficulty communicating.  If you haven't at least skimmed the design patterns don't call yourself a professional--same if you rely on them exclusively.,2019-02-19T22:31:14.313,1399
14362,5429,2,I always started to understand the previous math core course during the current one.,2019-02-20T00:24:32.273,5349

14365,5417,2,Remember what happened when Robert Pirsig tried to teach 'quality' in college...,2019-02-20T00:34:56.337,5349
14366,5417,0,_@BenCottrell I don't. The easiest example is that I've seen pervasive dependency inversion regularly lead to incredibly weird and difficult to follow object trees even *encouraging* shared stateful objects (database connections) that are quietly injected into the lowest level of dependencies. It was difficult to follow what actually happened to a connection in a given code path. As for not rules to be followed dogmatically the same could be said for design patterns. The problem is precisely that people take them too far replacing understanding and wisdom with pervasive blind application.,2019-02-20T00:55:22.113,981
14367,5434,3,_@BillK The bulk of the last comment is worthy. The closer however is not. I was a professional long before GoF 'Patterns' ( or C++) existed. I have still not read that book or any related material. I also do not believe I need to because I do not need to reduce my conversations to cliches or shared inaccurate nomenclature. Don't tell me which 'pattern' you code _almost_ implements explain what it does and how you can prove it does it correctly.,2019-02-20T01:01:07.770,104
14368,5417,0,_@ScottRowe - Yeah he went crazy.,2019-02-20T01:27:48.563,4511
14369,4428,0,Revisiting this almost a year later it occurs to me that you can only really make this case in languages that support some construct like `finally` that can be executed unconditionally. (Some other features that provide this sort of functionality are Python's context managers C#'s `IDisposable` and Java's `try`-with-resources.) Without that single return will likely serve you well in situations where you need to release a resource. Students should be made aware of that reality at minimum.,2019-02-20T01:34:53.847,981
14370,5434,2,_@GypsySpellweaver I suggest you at least skim it.  It's asked in enough interview questions today that you are severely restricting your job search if you don't.  I've also coded since the 80's before patterns existed and when I read the book I recognized nearly all the patterns as ones I've created at one point or another in my career.  It's not going to teach you how to code just how to communicate more efficiently.  My point above was that resisting knowledge like this is not professional.  A professional programmer is constantly improving himself with all the tools he can find.,2019-02-20T01:44:18.097,1399
14371,5417,0,_@HotLicks: Design Patterns are observations about the horrible things OOP programmers do presented as something to mimic...,2019-02-20T03:23:32.307,1327
14372,5417,1,_@R.. I try not to mimic programmers who go OOPS!,2019-02-20T03:33:43.223,4511
14373,5417,0,_@jpmc26 *The problem is precisely that people take them too far replacing understanding and wisdom with pervasive blind application* - surely that's all the more reason to have proper teaching of those principles?    The example you mention with dependency inversion sounds like it actually violates the principle ('Details should depend upon abstractions').,2019-02-20T07:17:53.623,6562
14374,5417,2,_@BenCottrell They're too subjective for them to be taught properly. They're not tied to anything concrete. Having them taught properly would be even harder than doing so with design patterns. If we can't get that right there's no way we could with something as subjective as SOLID and GRASP. Your response to my example demonstrates this subjectivity and lack of clarity. FYI they did depend on abstractions; the system pervasively used interfaces for everything. This could even be turned into an argument *for* the design: callers did not need to reference a connection.,2019-02-20T08:18:18.283,981
14375,5417,0,Your headline is another question than your question itself. Are you talking about a computer science course (headline) or a software engineering course (question text)? A SE course probably should include patters almost every other course probaly does not have to and probably should not. computer science courses should teach principles programming courses should teach programming without such overhead. But software engineering courses of course probably should teach such things. Please clarify if we're talking about a software engineering course or not.,2019-02-20T09:07:10.750,4631
14376,5416,0,_@ScottRowe Yes and the reason was that is all we had. We have learnt a lot since then. There are much better languages for both teaching and professional programmers. Your argument is like Microsoft is successful for a reason. In this case it is because they used to be cheaper than Unix. Now it is because we follow each other. (perfect market hypothesis see https://jimabbondante.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/change-processionary-cat.jpg?w=209&h=228 and https://notmanywise.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/caterpillars2.jpg,2019-02-20T09:32:57.850,204
14377,5433,1,Note: I see many teachers and students using the word DDOS (Distributed Denial Of Service) attack I never hear them saying DOS (Denial Of Service) attack. There is nothing distributed about what you are describing.,2019-02-20T09:36:32.740,204

14379,5417,0,Title is begging the question - a better form would be eg. Should a good CS course always teach Design Patterns. IMHO no - but it should be in the Programming modules.,2019-02-20T09:55:34.273,6607
14380,5416,0,We have better languages. People do not get better every generation though they all start with no concepts or experience. The Tower of Babel was not successful. A one-story house is.,2019-02-20T12:53:44.493,5349
14381,5426,2,Mostly agreed except for IDEF0 SSADM. They should definitely be there as an option but definitely not a requirement. They're more SoftEng than CS (unless your University merges those... then I guess they should be there).,2019-02-20T16:02:24.130,6585
14382,5417,0,_@jpmc26 How could a topic be 'too subjective' to be taught properly?   Many academic courses require students to think and understand subjective material otherwise if CompSci were only to include objective topics then that leads to precisely the problem you mention of students mindlessly sticking to dogma because they haven't had the opportunity to learn to understand the rationale behind these principles nor judge these things for themselves.,2019-02-20T16:33:12.213,6562
14383,3632,0,They are not at all too difficult if you are being guided and can evaluate code during the tutorial to follow along. Parsers in Haskell are amazingly elegant but also have an air of practicality that can help keep novices interested. A really simple arithmetic expression parser *and* evaluator is just one line: `expr = ( *> expr <**> (+ $> (+) <|> * $> (*)) <*> expr <* ) <|> decimal`. This also gives the opportunities to talk about some very useful Haskell operators and the importance of the little details in formal grammar definitions. 1 hour should be enough to cover 1 line of code.,2019-02-20T16:47:05.277,6585

14385,5433,0,Can you put a copy on a local shared drive?  Another clever way too get by could be to create a torrent as suggested ( https://torrentfreak.com/how-to-create-a-torrent/ ) but the optimal solution is likely to be the one suggested first and ask the site to give you a clean access pass.

14386,5418,1,Re:...Corrections for flaws....Many of the kinds of things that design patterns accomplish...in more natural ways within Common Lisp....  Those are such pointless comments. Many kinds of things can be accomplished more naturally in C++ than Lisp because of flaws in Lisp. However Lisp programmer's learn tricks to work around and implement those things. IOW they use design patterns whether they want to call them that or not. At the time the Design Patterns book came out C++ was the overwhelming OO'ish language of choice. Thus they are obviously more applicable to the C-family of languages.,2019-02-20T20:14:21.840,2817
14387,5417,0,_@BenCottrell By being counter-productive if it results in re-enforcing a misguided way of thinking about OO design. This is exactly what I see happens with SOLID. SOLID is *not* practical advice that can be applied to the process of writing code. It's a list of abstract easily misapplied hard to understand criteria that purport to describe a high quality end result (though whether it even necessarily identifies qualities that are actually important is up for debate). And it is the subjectivity of its ideas that lead to such diverse ideas about what in the heck it's even supposed to mean.,2019-02-21T05:08:48.917,981
14388,5416,0,_@scottrowe sorry if I suggested that things are getting better. My impression is that there was a flurry of progress in the 1960s and then not much else.

14390,3632,0,Hmm possibly though it felt too simple at the time to qualify as an answer I'll think about it and see if I can flesh it out into a proper one. The question did already consider an arithmetic expression evaluator so it did not feel like a useful answer.,2019-02-21T10:21:59.740,6585

14395,5439,1,I didn't want to make my post too long so I didn't mention that I also experienced your problem when I tried to get my students to sign up and upload their files on a hosting site (xfinityfree to be precise). Although the conditions here are different from my Nodejs.org problem your answer most certainly explains one half of the problem that caused me to post here in the first place. Thank you for replying.,2019-02-21T17:10:07.597,6591
14396,5417,0,_@jpmc26 It's not about teaching practical advice and it's not specifically about teaching SOLID either (GRASP and SOLID are only part of the picture) - it's about getting students to think for themselves by challenging them to grapple with the issues around software design so that they understand it's not a prescriptive process.    If students are never asked to think about concepts such as cohesion coupling separation of concerns abstraction dependencies etc then they will enter the job market in a weak position and more likely to misapply SOLID or even just create a Big Ball Of Mud.,2019-02-22T00:59:41.763,6562
14397,5417,0,_@BenCottrell On the contrary I find people who are intent on following SOLID at least as likely (if not more so) to create Big Balls of Mud. All of the principles and concepts you have mentioned are at best unhelpful in avoiding that. Our theories about how to build good code do not work. Even *having* these poor acronyms and overhyped terms invites people to misapply them in ways that are harmful to a code base. If we want to teach something then practical ways of evaluating code quality is what we need to be focusing on not these useless buzzwords.,2019-02-22T03:20:40.490,981
14398,5417,1,_@BenCottrell I don't agree with *everything* in this talk and I understand that languages don't always have the features to make all the particular simplifications possible but it still describes a better philosophy toward writing code than SOLID or GRASP or any of that stuff: https://youtu.be/o9pEzgHorH0. To sum it up it basically says not to make anything more complicated than it has to be. The fact we don't spend enough time teaching people to be this practical is a major major problem.,2019-02-22T03:55:44.060,981
14399,5417,1,_@jpmc26 You don't seem to be reading what I've said -- it's **not** about getting students to *follow* anything it's about teaching them to *think*.  At this point we seem to be talking past each other and you seem to be hung up on issues you've had with programmers who clearly didn't bother to think.    Just to repeat once again the purpose of teaching software design is all about challenging students to think about software design and not about following rules. If students aren't encouraged to think at university then they're more likely not to think at all when they're in a job,2019-02-22T12:53:33.427,6562
14400,5417,0,_@BenCottrell I read what you said. You don't seem to be grasping that whatever your intention is that *isn't* the result you actually get. The programmers I worked with thought *a lot* but buying into the popular OO ideas clouded their judgement. As I often see it do here on SE. Have [an example](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212381/versatile-string-validation/212432#comment410907_212432).,2019-02-22T13:05:40.087,981
14401,5417,1,_@jpmc26 So when do students learn about software design then?   Because they *will* be required to learn one way or another as soon as they enter the workplace and are asked to join a team working on any reasonably large non-trivial project with other software engineers.     They can either learn it at university when they've got the time to research the topic properly or they can be forced to learn it under far less than ideal conditions when there are deadlines and stakeholders.,2019-02-22T13:15:12.083,6562

14405,5417,1,I'm confused by the question; here's a way you could clarify it. Is a course in *astronomy* that does not teach *how to build a telescope* a bad course or a good course?  Is a course in *physics of structural engineering for buildings* that does not teach *how to design an elegant courtyard* a bad course or a good course?  You're asking a question about two things that have almost nothing to do with each other but your question indicates that there is some connection in your mind; can you explain what it is?,2019-02-22T19:26:24.267,2806
14406,4143,0,At my university the first language we were taught was Haskell a pure functional language where literally everything is recursive (no loops everything is immutable no side-affecting code). Teach them such a language and in particular solve problems that use useful recursive data structures such as trees. Show them how simple and effective recursion can be - this will become especially apparent to those of them who are more (pure-)mathematically inclined. Get them to start thinking with portals - they will start to see recursive solutions all the time and then they will have 'got it'.,2019-02-22T20:51:23.550,6652
14407,5418,0,Yes as I have told some students who complained about abstract concepts in their degree If you just wanted to learn to code you could have gone to a training course.,2019-02-22T22:22:31.473,2592
14408,5403,4,I think answering their questions (and ensuring they feel comfortable asking) should probably be much higher priority in your teaching. If they're still learning they probably need a lot of examples too. I'm guessing they're not as fluent with C as your impression seems to be. They probably need more practice with it.,2019-02-22T23:01:25.017,5296
14409,5417,0,_@EricLipper Agree entirely. In the design patterns epidemic of the late 1990s there seemed be a sustained attempt to reduce all of CS to design patterns. It failed miserably like all other attempts to impose magic on science. Even back in the 'top-down' days I remember thinking that this approach would never tell you how to write a compiler. Curiously enough Wirth a compiler writer was a proponent. Knuth said mildly that he preferred to think bottom-up ...,2019-02-23T02:59:45.500,3202
14410,5427,7,_@Lusan Nonsense. There is no 'ready library of visitor-implementations'. Every one has its own purpose. That is the whole idea. Design patterns is not a library it is a technique.,2019-02-23T03:05:04.710,3202
14411,5418,0,At my university I learned that the advantage of knowing the names of the design patterns is that you can communicate them easily to fellow team members. This wouldn't be possible if you don't know their names.,2019-02-23T14:07:22.220,6655
14412,5417,0,Imho the only benefit in learning design patterns is that you can quickly speak about implementations in a team without having to verbosely explain your solution since the pattern has a name. Much more important than knowing design patterns is knowing anti-patterns to avoid running in non-obvious issues which others already did frequently before you.,2019-02-23T14:46:23.797,6656
14413,5416,0,The video The Future of Programming is just as true today as the day it was made. I think everyone should see it. But I am about to show coworkers how to build web applications with ASP.Net and ADO.Net.,2019-02-23T19:35:06.807,5349
14414,5426,0,There are a few truths buried in here but most of the answer reads as a pompous rant pushing a very narrow view of the correct university course. Apparently I was taught wrong because I've never heard of SSADM or IDEF0; maybe they're some irrelevant thing from last year that everyone has forgotten about this year because there is a new fad and terminology.,2019-02-23T20:47:40.923,6663
14415,5403,0,I find your phrase *mapping an individual's thoughts to formal language* mildly disturbing. Just sayin'...,2019-02-23T21:40:20.140,5349
14416,5427,0,_@user207421 Can't state that any stronger. And if someone writes code in Swift the whole visitor pattern disappears because instead of creating some Visitor class you just pass a closure as a function argument.,2019-02-24T10:58:05.497,4529
14417,5428,0,The GoF book is also more a catalogue of patterns whereas correctly organized patterns should come in the form of a *pattern language*. A lot of people seem to use the GoF book as a recipe for designing systems which it is not. It is a catalogue of patterns where you can look up a pattern when you already know you need it. For discovering which patterns you need you need a pattern language.,2019-02-24T22:36:47.890,945
14418,289,0,Wonderful! I'd just like to point out that the developer tools are **not specific to Chrome**. Firefox and Safari both have quite capable dev tools as well (I don't have experience with any other browsers). Let's not forget that Chrome isn't the only browser!,2019-02-25T05:12:33.330,3700
14421,5428,0,_@J??rgWMittag makes a good point. The GoF book is not a textbook and it is by no means didactic. Pretending it is written for beginners and using it in undergraduate-level courses is not very good teaching IMHO.,2019-02-26T11:58:14.237,5109
14422,5442,0,Hi Johnny welcome to [cseducators.se]!  We are quite glad to see you here!  However this answer is incorrect.  A mathematical function $f(x) = ...$ must always return the same value given the same $x$ but that is not the case for a programming function.  (See OP's `rand()` as a perfect example.)  In addition a mathematical function must always return a result while a programming function can instead produce a side-effect.  (See [mutators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method).),2019-02-27T01:12:47.630,27
14423,5444,0,Your definition of programming paradigm is not commonly accepted.  Please see [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm).  Many of them are inter-compatible including both OOP with functional programming and OOP with procedural programming.,2019-02-27T01:23:37.653,27
14425,5443,1,Of course there are intro to CS classes in Java and many of them. It is the most commonly taught language in intro-level cs classes at universities (at least as of two years ago.),2019-02-27T01:37:01.930,27
14426,5443,0,Also much of the art of teaching is figuring out when to introduce wrinkles in order to allow students time to absorb complex ideas. When introducing the letter j to a 3 year old we might say that j at the beginning of a word makes a d?? sound. It would be utterly unfair (and counterproductive!) to mention at this moment that there is another language French in which it actually sounds like ??. While the d?? statement is a lie it keeps information at a level at which it can be absorbed. The child can get to other languages later and will learn about other sounds at that time.,2019-02-27T01:38:27.887,27
14427,5442,0,_@johnny what function in mathematics is something like `function foo() {  echo Hello; }` ?  (going javascript-ic). Nowadays in most programming languages the word *function* refers to a piece of code with parameters which does some actions and maybe transmits a value when ended.,2019-02-27T14:14:53.587,2103
14428,5444,0,I think the customary duality is functional/imperative--not functional/procedural. I also think you've possibly misapprehended a few other concepts as well.  State is not otherwise known as global variables--at least not for any definition of state I've ever seen.,2019-02-27T21:19:04.510,4689
14429,5446,0,Thanks for the good answer however I tend to disagree on the dismissing of the point. As for the introductory purpose that's true for metaphors but it's really needed only if the new concept has some complexity elementary or simple concepts should be well understandable on their own. As for analogies they ought to be ana-logic carrying the same logic to help reasoning. If the terms do not share the fundamental logic points and are just to be forgotten early then they do harm and not good. More so for young learners possibly untrained to know that analogies fail.,2019-02-27T21:52:03.157,6546
14430,5446,2,They have to share _some_ but not all points of logic to be useful. And it is your job to _teach_ them the limitations - especially for young learners with less experience.,2019-02-27T21:54:42.527,1293
14431,5446,0,Yes but the points actually shared should be the fundamental ones and my doubt is about this. I cannot see how stir until thickened shares a fundamental point with while(i<n) I mean: not *before* understanding state transitions. The point shared (sooner or later we will stop and the computing one doesn't even guarantee that) is arguably the only one that doesn't need explanation.,2019-02-27T22:13:57.877,6546
14432,5446,1,Actually my example is more like repeat x until y. But you can also say while the sauce is thin stir it. Match the analogy/metaphor to your lesson of course. And sometimes the sauce never does thicken. It is fairly rich (both the analogy and the sauce). But don't overload it.,2019-02-27T22:22:51.210,1293
14433,5446,0,Well I don't really think of a difference between while and until but I digress. The point is not so much my lessons for of course I can say what I feel and test the pupils; it's not me the one who I worry may overload the meanings: it's the students and their free access to resources that may use this kind of analogies having me then do more work to unteach them something wrong.,2019-02-27T22:37:52.383,6546
14434,5446,0,Well that happens anyway. Unlikely you can prevent it.,2019-02-27T22:40:29.967,1293
14435,5446,0,True but I may provide a better analogy beforehand :) And really my question was more for an intellectual challenge and discussion and a general result than for actual pupils.,2019-02-27T22:53:18.813,6546
14436,5445,0,Re Is the ... analogy ... good or bad? Good or bad for _what purpose?_  IMO if your purpose is to explain what the word algorithm means then recipe comes pretty close:  If you follow these steps ... you end up with a loaf of bread.  If you follow _these_ steps ... you end up with the greatest common divisor of two given numbers. But if you aren't trying to teach what algorithm means then what _are_ you trying to teach?,2019-02-28T03:09:43.903,1269
14437,5445,0,Re Realistic programs are not ... but ... If you are trying to teach somebody how to design computer software then that's a whole other topic. You are absolutely right: A software system is not an algorithm and an algorithm is not a software system and it really doesn't matter whether or not either one of them bears any resemblance to a recipe.,2019-02-28T03:14:03.703,1269
14438,5445,2,Re ...scripts... A script is a computer program. Period. The only reason we call it a script is either that we are trying not to scare off somebody who thinks that programming is too hard to attempt or else we want to belittle the efforts of somebody who we think has not earned the title programmer.,2019-02-28T03:18:55.083,1269
14439,5446,0,_@user9137 I cannot see how stir until thickened shares a fundamental point with while(i<n).  Truly?  What about `while (thickness < desired)`?  It's not even an analogy it is literally the same semantic meaning.,2019-02-28T19:59:36.097,27
14440,5445,1,We use the term scripts to differentiate between short functions built at runtime by a user from the core application code,2019-03-01T00:37:53.457,1537
14441,4515,0,_@philipxy Very little of programming today is math. Screen aesthetics occupies 50% or more of an application's budget. Even machine learning which at its core is statistical modeling has been reduced to use this library to construct a neural net and use a particular function from that library to apply the bias function. Sadly I spend a lot of my time chasing scope errors in the definition of Spring beans.,2019-03-01T04:11:35.123,1537
14443,5444,0,Comments may only be edited for five minutes?  What in the world?  Little dictators.  The people who run this site have never changed their mind or made an edit after five minutes?  This site is weird.,2019-03-02T14:04:54.040,6669
14444,5444,0,State is most definitely another way of saying global variables. Maybe functional vs imperative is a better way of saying functional vs procedural but the purpose of teaching functional is still about lack of state as I clearly stated in my post. Being that OO is not a real concept for any practical (nor even theoretical) purposes I have no response for anyone who uses OO. It is becoming increasingly clear to me that the state of CS education is in a quagmire and the people here seem to have some very funny ideas about CS Math and Logic.,2019-03-02T14:06:18.210,6669
14445,5442,0,Computers do only one thing at the atomic level and that is process functions.  That's why they are called computers.  Everything in a computer is either a function or an argument and everything is deduced down to a function.  A function of functions is still a function.  This is BASIC stuff (no pun intended).  If you don't understand that you cannot teach CS.  You can teach programming I suppose but certainly not science.  I cannot be polite or diplomatic here.  Many of you have literally no idea what you are talking about and you are imbuing deeply flawed concepts into your students.,2019-03-02T14:14:46.850,6669
14446,5442,0,must always return the same value given the same x but that is not the case for a programming function.  Ben there is NO SUCH THING as random.  This is accepted science in the CS community.  It may be a question in the physics community but until then it is MOST DEFINITELY not a question in the computer science community except maybe in some deep theoretical circles.,2019-03-02T14:20:02.537,6669
14447,5443,0,Of course there are intro to CS classes in Java and many of them. It is the most commonly taught language in intro-level cs classes at universities.  You are correct.  And yet you have completely missed the point.,2019-03-02T14:37:21.600,6669
14448,4717,0,_functional interfaces were added with Java 1.8_ ?€? **Corollary:** Java's functional interfaces are not interfaces. (This looks like an example of the [red herring principle](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/red+herring+principle).),2019-03-02T16:50:04.617,3718
14449,5442,0,_@johnny You are again incorrect. There are plenty of (computer) functions that return truly random numbers that take advantage of water eddies and even a provably random function that had been created using quantum randomness.,2019-03-02T21:48:03.593,27
14450,5442,0,_@Johnny Even if we are to accept your definitions no one would be coding mathematical functions in C because the metaphors of C (and even assembly) don't involve thinking at the level of mathematical functions. The functions you are referring to only exist at the level of electronics and booleans. If you believe that CS1 should begin at carry-adder circuits feel free to develop a course. Typically circuits don't enter into CS until year 3.,2019-03-02T21:50:14.883,27
14451,5442,0,_@Johnny The reason no one seems to be agreeing with you is because you are saying a lot of (provably) incorrect things. You are welcome to come here and contribute and learn but you MUST be polite and diplomatic. Consider this your warning: this is a forum for reasoned discourse.  Ideas can be attacked but not people. Be Nice is a serious rule here and you have been pushing its boundaries to the limit. If you cannot abide by these rules you will be sanctioned.,2019-03-02T21:54:33.540,27
14453,3925,0,It has been nearly 1 year and a half since this post and thank God I have learned so much in the past year and I feel more confident in my skills. Here are some things that helped me for those who see the post later: (1) Get an internship. I did an internship over the summer. I was held accountable on a project and because I was paid to complete i felt a huge sense of responsibility to complete it successfully. (2) Connect with positive and humble developers  and try to learn a little bit from everyone (3)  be confident and do not undersell your skills (but please do not become arrogant),2019-03-05T16:39:57.973,3438
14454,3925,0,when I did my internship I had more pressure to the fill the holes in my knowledge by learning quickly.  I would also recommend paired programming as it is always faster to learn by doing and have a person to converse with about any bugs in the code.,2019-03-05T16:47:38.077,3438
14455,5448,1,How would using the [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/) project to build an OS not fit into your goals?,2019-03-06T01:11:32.780,104
14456,5448,1,Oh and Welcome! to [cseducators.se]. Always nice to see users from other stacks in the SE-vers.,2019-03-06T01:12:48.987,104
14457,5449,0,Fantastic.  I will make a note of this answer in case I ever develop an OS course!,2019-03-06T20:19:07.680,27
14458,5450,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se].  Take a look around we're glad to have  you!,2019-03-06T20:19:48.407,27
14459,5403,1,state machines as in finite automata?,2019-03-07T04:48:18.603,6701
14461,1044,0,I like the idea of introducing regular expression first before nfa/dfa. But i feel sad reading your last sentence.,2019-03-07T04:57:15.613,6701
14462,1077,1,I cannot find the chat though..,2019-03-07T04:58:30.567,6701
14463,5403,0,Scott: writing code is giving a shape of code to one's thoughts of operations and the like for disturbing it may be.,2019-03-07T15:30:14.143,6546
14464,5451,6,The problem isn't that they misunderstand the code; rather it's they have an incomplete (or incorrect) model of computation. They don't see memory as an array of cells nor do they understand how the code gets executed. Flowcharts might help. Use a visual debugger that lets you see the call stack and variables. Try avoiding the for loop until they've mastered the while loop which makes its steps more explicit.,2019-03-07T17:30:00.197,6704
14465,5403,0,Kate: yes state machines as in automata.,2019-03-07T18:13:36.613,6546
14466,5451,1,Sort of yes sure. They absolutely lack a model of computation and that's arguably a major point how can you teach to write code without the least of models of computation? I recall the very first thing at my univ was: these are our building blocks it was a minimal von Neumann model but any would do except the non-existent one. The problem is that this is what I think not what was thought by the ones who initiated my pupils and I cannot change their history just trying to reshape their models dealing with their resistance and below ground motivation in the meantime.,2019-03-07T18:21:28.763,6546
14467,5448,0,Unix once was _an_ operating system way long ago and then it branched out to become a family of operating systems but that's all history. Unix today is a _[proprietary specification](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix)_ with which some operating systems have been certified to conform and it's a trademark that conforming operating systems are allowed to display.,2019-03-07T19:54:53.847,1269
14468,5448,0,Linux never was an operating system.  Linux is merely a _[kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))_ upon which an operating system can be built. The majority of operating systems that incorporate the Linux kernel (e.g. Debian Ubuntu Red Hat) strive to be as Unix-like as possible although very few of those actually have received the certification that would allow them to actually use the word Unix in their names.,2019-03-07T19:58:59.293,1269
14469,5448,2,Re students...[have] had only an introductory Python course. If that's true then they won't have much of a clue about the kinds of services that an operating system provides. It's a pretty big step from knowing how to write and run simple Python programs to understanding things like demand-paged virtual memory shared library modules inter-process communication thread scheduling device drivers network protocol stacks... It's hard for me to imagine teaching somebody how those things are implemented if the student doesn't even know what they _are_.,2019-03-07T20:14:36.520,1269
14470,5452,0,I completely agree with you drawing the memory is the best thing I know for understanding imperative (stateful) code simply because drawing the memory amounts to **seeing** the states transitions that are described by the code fragment. The problem here is that I cannot really do it in short time I was hoping for something of strong effect: it's a 5th year class that has been trained for the past 4 to use global variables for everything and to emit swarms of printf in place of computing results. In my opinion this is about the idea of brain damage considered by ED. Am I wrong?,2019-03-07T22:47:11.633,6546
14471,5452,0,Looking forward to check out the video anyway might be helpful! Possibly even just letting them see that I am not the only one to draw on a blackboard what the code does when executed. They think I'm kind of crazy for forbidding them the use of prints and it's quite frustrating.,2019-03-07T22:52:24.710,6546
14472,5453,0,Yes! Definitely agree. (Besides having yet to see the java code :) ). For what I can I am constantly trying to show them small pieces and their connections. Problem is that so many times I already have shown them that a function cannot return many values how a for translates to a while how the variables are updated they just kind of don't want to believe it and their motivation is really 0. They're used to these crazy I/O operations: oh we need to know how many iterations let's scanf something! I was even starting wondering: is this what cobol was made of? What's this thing?,2019-03-07T23:14:22.780,6546
14473,5453,0,Unfortunately I cannot introduce them functions and loops they've already been introduced in previous years they shouldn't even be so much unaware of those concepts. My goal was having them build small real algorithms let's say for linear algebra I have already given up on this actually.,2019-03-07T23:21:34.773,6546
14474,5453,0,When I mentioned the shocking effect I was thinking something so short as a for (i=0; i<5; i*=2). Just I don't think I am producing examples of good interest and of the right degree between too trivial and too crazy. Has anyone an arsenal of things of this kind? Btw has anyone else noticed that learning steps in CS seem to be wider than other disciplines?,2019-03-07T23:28:28.380,6546
14475,5451,1,What about the mandelbrot set? It's remarkably simple but nonalgebraic and the output makes nice T-shirts,2019-03-08T01:18:57.143,1537
14476,5451,0,What language are you using?,2019-03-09T11:25:20.937,204
14477,5448,0,_@SolomonSlow UNIX is the trademark not Unix. But you bring up a good point about Linux being just the kernel so not a full operating system I will add an answer.,2019-03-09T11:36:04.433,204
14478,5454,0,Thanks for the answer it has its place but it's not adequate for my specific case: my course is not Java we have no classes (fortunately!) we need just a very very basic intro to the world of computing. The pupils had a taste of COBOL written with C syntax and are addict to printf before computing. I showed them Javascript to work more gently with arrays but they have a really hard time understanding what do I mean for working with arrays: there is no output print and they are lost. I think adding the complexity of testing is a bit too much for people who cannot understand a for loop.,2019-03-10T10:21:17.243,6546
14479,5454,0,Hmmm. You mentioned Java in a comment. There are similar unit testing frameworks for most languages actually.,2019-03-10T10:25:52.197,1293
14480,5451,0,Javascript. They saw C syntax and I chose js to be more gentle with arrays. They would benefit a lot from some scheme but I couldn't afford such a big leap: I would have seen them drowning in parentheses. And my (imposed) target was: implementation of linear algebra algorithms.,2019-03-10T10:30:54.853,6546
14481,5454,0,I don't think I mentioned Java I may be in error but it may also be that I can be confused with someone else my name does not seem designed for identification tasks :) Anyway no probl. The more discussions I can see the happier I am. I'm starting to give up with this class because besides the technical problems they are also very demotivated and this complicates things even more: they sort of demand that I just write code while they do nothing with their brains probably I'll end up with this.,2019-03-10T10:41:12.240,6546
14484,5457,0,That's a nice idea thanks I don't recall having ever heard of sensors in the logo turtle. Anyway yes what I was looking for is exactly what you mentioned: interesting examples to use the information stored in the program or coming as input to the program.,2019-03-12T11:22:06.653,6546
14485,5458,0,I generally agree but also note that a microkernel is amazingly small.,2019-03-12T14:45:23.763,1293
14486,5456,0,You didn't mention the age or level of your students so the advice you receive is going to be quite generic.  You also didn't mention which turtle system you would be using.  Are you using Python's version?  Have you found old-school Logo somewhere?  Are you using the drawing capabilities of Scratch?,2019-03-12T15:15:37.323,27
14487,5460,0,It sounds like your mental model of learning is pretty similar to mine particularly vis-a-vis complexity and abstraction.  I love this answer.,2019-03-12T17:48:59.757,27

14495,5461,0,Thank you for the comments and the chatroom. I'll edit again later if I manage to split the question down.,2019-03-13T09:50:54.537,6701
14497,5461,1,I teach computational theory but I'm not sure how to approach this question. You have a wide degree of latitude depending on the goals of the course which either you your department your school or your state get to set. What do *you* want your students to get out of the course? What are the key ideas you want them to understand? What do you hope they will be able to do with it?,2019-03-13T17:35:45.287,27
14498,5456,0,ctrl: yes yes I mean recursion as in `(define (while c f) (begin (f) (when (c) (while c f))))`.,2019-03-13T20:15:23.550,6546
14499,5456,0,Ben: age 15 absolute beginners. Turtle based on the descriptions I found about the old logo I briefly described it in the question (basically just drawing lines). What interests me is ideas for introducing the fact that there exists a primitive called while that does what we want to do: I look for some interesting what we want to do possibly the most diverse to not lock the students in thinking that it's something of too narrow applicability.,2019-03-13T20:24:36.970,6546
14503,5434,0,In @Buffy's defence he's not being so ballsy.  The post you linked to supports his position more than yours once you delve into the comments.  Even the author of said post asserts that they are needed from time to time: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/137975/what-is-so-bad-about-singletons#comment2667126_138012.,2019-03-14T10:51:40.320,27
14504,5434,0,_@BenI. - No he said he *uses* them from time to time not that they are needed. Being a purely a defensive measure (over simply only creating one of the object in question) they are never *needed*.,2019-03-14T12:58:51.160,1139
14506,3275,0,I like this perspective on the ephemerality of knowledge. I'd not really considered it in those terms but you make a great point about always appraising what you do and know and always at least being ready to find a better way of doing something.,2019-03-14T15:27:45.710,2613
14508,5434,0,Fair enough.  And in your defense you also didn't say to never use them you said almost never.   Everything has its time and place.  :),2019-03-14T16:22:01.510,27
14509,5452,2,The term I always heard for writing the values of variables as the code is hand-evaluated is **Desk Checking**. I guess the idea was that people didn't formerly have computers sitting on their desks. They simulated the computations with pencil and paper. If someone cannot do this they cannot program because they cannot understand the code.,2019-03-15T02:09:33.737,5349
14510,5468,1,I also was a Teaching Assistant for a programming 101 course for non-computer majors back in 1987. Same approach... What does this line of code do? Now what does the next line do? Some mastered it quickly some struggled some were uninterested. Pouring water on a horse does not result in people learning to program. Apples work though.,2019-03-15T02:24:13.733,5349
14511,5451,0,Just out of curiosity (bad motivation sorry) where is this happening? I have trouble imagining students going through years of instruction and not wanting to learn. Why don't they just drop out or switch programs of study? Programming is quite demanding it is not something you can do for a job if you don't enjoy it and have developed the ability to learn on your own.,2019-03-15T02:31:46.197,5349
14512,5451,0,Scott: at school of course ;),2019-03-15T08:56:28.693,6546
14513,5468,0,Yes! Thanks! Sounds like a great approach I hope I can try it in the short remaining time span.,2019-03-15T09:00:07.903,6546
14514,5468,1,Mmh thinking about it again maybe what they struggle with the most is not the concept of loop it's that of mutation. I mean they have this idea that things in `for` are going to be repeated but probably they have no idea how: maybe they think I want repetition -> I write for but without understanding. They are so much confused that even I don't understand where is the confusion :D [...],2019-03-15T09:22:09.960,6546
14515,5468,0,The other day something shocked me: a girl supposed to be quite good was tracing a loop with my supervision and at the moment of `i++` she added a new line at the bottom with the new `i` I tried to convince her that it would be more precise to update the `i` where it was but she resisted a lot and thought there's no difference in updating it or adding one new. Am I wrong wanting them to mutate? Is there value in her method?,2019-03-15T09:22:18.117,6546
14516,5452,0,Yes Scott. Can't agree more. My 5th year students told me they last did something similar 3 years ago not often and not reinforced I have no idea how they did so but I'd guess not in an effective way because it's not second nature for them worse it was still difficult to show them how I'd do it and they have no will in following this method. I could accept they consider it boring were they proficient but clearly they aren't.,2019-03-15T09:35:42.220,6546
14517,5468,0,The splendor and mystery of *Mutation*. For some reason I never experienced e dreaded confusion about what exactly it is or how to use it in a program but I have read that it is a major stumbling block. To be fair a *variable* is unlike any other thing in the entire universe you can just *change its value* any time you want. Noting else in our world works that way. When I was in 8th grade and a teacher was explaining programming he drew a rectangle on the board wrote 'X' next to it and said this is a variable. Then he wrote 7 in it. Then he added one to X erased the 7 and wrote 8. --,2019-03-15T10:57:47.410,5349
14518,5468,2,-- Apparently we are too proud of ourselves these days to begin the explanation at this low level. But I never had any question in my mind what a variable was and when people said that *mutation* was confusing to students I was like yeah like a doorknob is confusing... So when I encountered the dreaded concept the horrific terror if *Indirection* the next year it was not much of a stretch. **Oh a variable that holds an address.** We can increment it etc. But I get flack from people on this site about teaching this way. **I learned this way. It works.**,2019-03-15T11:03:34.947,5349
14519,5451,1,Based on your comments to my answer you won't be able to 'shock' them because they don't have enough correct understanding in place to have their assumptions violated. They need concepts first.,2019-03-15T11:10:52.120,5349
14520,5468,0,I feel exactly like that: oh this can hold a value oh now I change it. It's so damn simple I still cannot understand the least how this may be confusing for the students. But the evidence says it is I would be so glad could I have a clue why but I don't. All I know how to do is tracing the execution drawing memory. It's easy clear effective. But they don't do it they weren't taught to do it and they are scared that I want them to do it. More than showing it the same crystal clear way as your `x=7; x++;` I don't know what could I do. I can't understand what's the difficult point.,2019-03-15T23:40:46.613,6546
14521,5468,1,Probably this is a case where the major difficulty is unlearning a confused way of writing mindless random things without any reason more than learning a concept that would clarify things but that requires thought energy. Btw another strange thing I see in younger students (to their defense it's the first time they see anything related to cs) is that they imagine the code do what they have in their minds instead of what's written. They give personality and force of will to the code. Also here it's quite difficult for me to understand why.,2019-03-15T23:52:52.410,6546
14523,3601,0,Maybe revision control isn't a CS thing but collaboration is code review is and so is testing. I'd argue that revision control is essential to all of those activities and the ability to engage productively in those activities is often looked for in interviews.,2019-03-18T00:58:46.090,134
14524,3593,0,I think the notion that you can (or should be able to) teach yourself a VCS has some validity - <ironic>it's mostly how I learned all of the ones that I've used</ironic>. But that only makes me think that it should most definitely included in the curriculum - teaching yourself is a valuable and transferable CS skill and VCS is a skill that would be widely useful in a CS program. Maybe do a brief explanation of the rationale and point students at a variety of good tutorials and offer a few lab sessions? Then adjust your curriculum so students appreciate having the skill...,2019-03-18T01:09:34.690,134
14525,70,0,+1 on the reason. A big motivation for some of my students is the easy ability to access their code from home. And when collaborative projects come along many will appreciate having tools to support parallel development (my students want it to work like Google Docs with partners typing in the same file at the same time - while at the same time resisting pair programming I'd love a way to let them try that without a lot of overhead...).,2019-03-18T03:02:56.120,134
14526,5435,0,Seems possible to me that teachers and students are routed different and come from different IP addresses. So when the students mistype their passwords (and are all coming from the same IP address) the site get suspicious but teachers are not effected.,2019-03-18T03:13:16.387,134
14527,5435,0,I'd be surprised if it is your school network or the filtering service. I think it is much more likely that the Moodle was seeing lots of failed login attempts which it interpreted as either login probing or a DOS attack and so it blocked the school's IP address. The block may timeout or it may need to be cleared manually.,2019-03-18T03:24:27.623,134
14530,5433,0,The problem isn?€?t that it looks like a DDoS attack it clearly doesn?€?t - all the traffic is from the same IP. It?€?s that it looks like a brute force attempt to break in. The rate and duration are probably also too low for it to look like a DoS attack.,2019-03-18T13:59:08.680,134
14531,5162,0,That's a great suggestion @Buffy!  Thanks for sharing that answer!,2019-03-18T16:20:15.037,4689
14533,5470,0,You may be interested in https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/2897/204 Maybe you can help by giving an answer.

14540,5476,0,This answer is a bit of a stub.  Would you mind expanding on what you've said here?  If it is helpful it seems like these two parts were unaddressed in your answer: *What are essential skills with revision control tools? What are best practices (or good sources for learning about them)?*,2019-03-20T13:53:32.697,27
14544,5476,0,Would love to hear about how you?€?re incorporating Agile boards into your classes.,2019-03-20T21:35:42.753,134
14545,5257,0,According to me if people interested in this then nothing is difficult for them. I'm not sure this is true (at least not universally true). I'm very interested in music and I would love to be able to carry a tune when singing - but so far it has eluded me. Maybe nothing is impossible...,2019-03-20T21:41:19.893,134

14547,5458,0,Some are some aren't :-) IIRC the Mach microkernel was bigger than the BSD/OS macrokernel as we would configure it for a fairly typical server. Wish I could remember the actual numbers but it's been like 20 years?€?,2019-03-21T03:42:08.510,134
14548,5455,0,I'm with you on the x86 in a mess front but it is widely enough used that there is a wealth of material and resources that use it as their example. Personally I'd be inclined to build one of the PDP-11/70 models and use the Lions book - only half in jest...,2019-03-21T03:49:06.093,134
14550,5455,0,x86 is not a popular as you may think. The ARM out sells it by about 5:1 (this data may be out of date it is from before smart phones with an ARM chip in each). However there may be more learning material for x86 created by misguided people that think there is a good reason that we use x86. (We use it because of an historical accident: IBM used it in a dead-end project that got popular because it was cheaper than Unix and had spread-sheets.),2019-03-21T10:05:20.920,204
14553,5480,0,Are you focused on HS (Secondary education) or otherwise (broader other)?,2019-03-21T14:41:23.867,1293
14554,5480,0,My standards work is K-2; I teach at a high school.  We are creating programs for both in-house at the upper 11-12 level and more broadly at the K12 level both formal an informal.  So I will happily take all suggestions!,2019-03-21T15:33:03.690,6741
14555,5480,0,Elementary ed too? I assume you meant K-12 not K-2.,2019-03-21T15:37:01.703,1293
14556,5480,0,You may want to check out [this question](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5080/what-belongs-in-a-low-math-undergraduate-ai-elective-besides-ml) - it's not a duplicate but it's similar enough that it might well be helpful.,2019-03-21T20:39:16.013,27
14557,5468,0,I didn't have any problem with mutation either. But I learned programming long before I learned algebra. Today many students start programming after algebra and perhaps that is part of the problem. There is a confusion between programming notation and mathematical notation. Some students think that writing `y=a+3` means that the value of y will always be three more than a so if you change a y changes too. In algebra `=` is an assertion of equality. In programming it's mutation. Some students have to be told this explicitly.,2019-03-21T20:48:56.527,6704
14558,5468,1,_@BarryBrown yes I have heard about this confusion too. I recall a girl saying *How can x ever equal x plus 1?* It took me a moment to figure out what on earth she was saying. But if you drew a box on the board and wrote in it then it seems obvious that a and y are not magically linked. People are not learning in a way that makes it obvious what is happening which means that teachers are not writing on the board and uttering the correct words. It is not a magic spell it is just explanation. The idea of Functional Programming will only increase this confusion.,2019-03-21T22:56:24.810,5349
14560,5481,0,Is this a self-learning situation or are you faced with teaching a group of such students? Also what is your own background if you are the teacher of such a group?,2019-03-22T14:30:01.870,1293
14561,5481,1,Why are premed students taking programming in the first place?  What is the *goal* of the course?,2019-03-22T15:36:57.300,27
14562,5481,0,_@BenI. maybe it is a research oriented program for the medical sector. I'd like more information of course.,2019-03-22T16:29:36.060,1293
14563,5480,0,_@Buffy My standards work is K-2 as I am on that grade band team.  I've taught every grade throughout my career.  Currently I work at a high school and we are creating curricular resources for K-12.,2019-03-22T17:25:37.660,6741
14564,5483,0,Do the students already know Python or something similar? CS students usually do by the time they get to such a course.,2019-03-22T19:48:17.140,1293
14565,5484,0,Interesting but no use for me (number 6) as it is a proprietary program (Not [Free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)).,2019-03-22T19:54:12.483,204
14566,5484,0,Ah yes I'd overlooked your restriction to only considering FOSS. That's really going to limit your options and honestly you're probably best just learning command-line git.  For what it's worth I've taught all my intro classes (both CS1 and a pseudo-CS0.5) with _very basic_ git. They learn to fork (on GitHub) my work clone their forks so they can edit code locally stage and commit new revisions and push their work back up to their forks. It usually takes a little struggling at first but most students have it down within a few assignments.,2019-03-22T20:08:08.257,6746
14567,5484,0,I do command-line and Gui mercurial (hg). It is much easier but a shame that its internals are not so beautiful. Hopefully the next gen revision-control system (distributed) will be beautiful on the inside and the outside.,2019-03-22T20:11:41.677,204
14568,5486,0,What a detailed and helpful reply! I will be making good use of this post over the next few weeks.,2019-03-23T12:47:45.283,27
14569,5482,0,I like the statement forget which students are pre-med... Etc. I used to tell my students that programmers are not paid to have opinions. Teachers are not either.,2019-03-23T14:43:37.660,5349
14570,5481,0,The good news is that it only takes about 10000 hours to become proficient at anything. Start now and you can get there in a few years of all-out effort. Otherwise get used to being a dabbler. Is there value in that? Yes. I used to be a Teaching Assistant in a 101 college course in programming for non-majors. Many students came away with helpful experience some did not. I didn't try to figure out which would be which.,2019-03-23T14:48:31.633,5349
14572,5485,0,This is important to impress on people computers are machines just as Ada Lovelace said. No matter how complex and sophisticated until they become self-aware they are not thinking understanding deciding... They are as dumb as a piece of silicon and have no insight. People in China or Japan I forget which are currently talking with a conversing voice on their phones because they are lonely. Humans are very easily drawn in  to anything that remotely seems like an interaction because we have to care for infants and we make huge efforts to see them as beings. Computers are not.,2019-03-24T13:21:34.667,5349
14573,5485,0,_@ScottRowe it is not the silicone of it that makes in dumb. Look at how it works. There is a control-unit conducting the orchestra but unable to hear and does not even know what the instruments are. There is the ACU being controlled by the control-unit just doing logic operations on its input and outputting something that makes sense to the programmer. None of this remembers what it just did so no program could be written to allow self awareness (If you try to make it self aware then it can only be aware of the current instruction: a part of the self-awareness program).,2019-03-24T13:59:10.697,204
14574,5485,0,Some people argue that humans cannot possibly have consciousness either because they are composed of material substances following deterministic laws. Consciousness has never been adequately explained indeed people can not even agree on a definition. It would be better if people realized that they are not unmaterial and special also. We somehow have insight but it does not guarantee anything least of all correct conclusions. We are smarter than a lump of silicon but perhaps not for long. Then we really will be able to have insightful conversations with conversing voices.,2019-03-24T14:14:10.443,5349
14575,5485,0,I don't thing that the material has anything to do with it. I don't see any reason why silicone etc. can't do what carbon etc. does. I only see that the current computer configurations can not be self-aware. Maybe one day we will work out how to do it differently and then they will take over and turn us all into fertiliser.,2019-03-24T14:19:21.810,204
14576,5485,0,We keep pets. I see no reason why an intelligence greater than ours would not simply do the same. My cat has a longer and healthier life than a wild kitty but probably more boring. These are details that something smarter than ourselves would find trivial. Besides humans might have interesting and useful perspectives that an AI lacks. It need not be adversarial. My dog could catch Frisbees way better and run faster than I could to say nothing of nose and ear sensitivity. But modern computers are still dumb despite playing Chess and Go (and probably driving vehicles) better.,2019-03-24T15:05:17.837,5349
14577,5483,0,The only language they're guaranteed to have previous exposure to is C++. *Some* other students may have exposure to other languages (Python included) but not all students are CS students because the course is in a cross-disciplinary Data Science certificate program (math and cs).,2019-03-24T20:54:47.797,6746
14578,5488,1,Upvoted for contributing something new though I disagree.  Children can do it is hardly a solid metric of ease.  Children also learn to read but it's hardly easy. It takes literally years to learn well. Any topic of sufficient depth comes with enormous potential cognitive burdens.  While lowering the standards can cause more people to pass it's hard for me to imagine that this will advance the field at large; we would be slowing down the 50% of the students who already thrive in order to accommodate the 25% of students who are not doing well. We need differentiated responses.,2019-03-24T22:26:43.550,27
14579,5488,1,I wouldn't read too much into that one line because the author has important points in the full text. For what it's worth I am not fully endorsing either the programming is difficult or programming is easy standpoint. However I do think the stigma of being a hard major doesn't really do us any favors besides feeding egos for those of us who made it through any way.,2019-03-25T00:28:18.590,6746
14580,5488,0,Perhaps children should start learning about computers when they are learning to speak and read? The best skiers and skaters start as soon as they can stand up. Same for horse riding gymnastics and so on. We could give young children technology products when they are two... Wait.,2019-03-25T01:21:42.567,5349
14581,5480,0,This needs more context to be truly answerable. Is the target audience completely generalist (i.e. the goal is to give literature students a broad-brush idea of current notions of AI) interested in CS in general but not necessarily specifically in AI or specifically interested in AI and already knowledgeable about foundations of CS? How much time is available?,2019-03-25T11:42:06.913,1219
14582,5488,1,_@KevinBuffardi I skimmed over the full paper.  What it's missing entirely is the idea that people are just *different*.  I guess what I'm suggesting is that the topic is neither intrinsically hard *nor* intrinsically easy; it depends on your personal background and how you are personally wired.  It's very easy for some brutally difficult for some others and somewhere in the middle for most. (That statement should track with our intuitive lived experience pretty well.)  (cont...),2019-03-25T14:02:49.200,27
14583,5488,0,(...) The fallacy is thinking that the topic itself is either.  Instead I'd argue that the topic is sufficiently complex to cause substantially divergent difficulties for different individuals.,2019-03-25T14:03:44.757,27
14585,5485,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Re ...none of this remembers what it just did so no program could be written to allow self awareness. That sounds like non-sequitur. Natural-language understanding systems going all the way back to [SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU) in 1968 can answer questions about what they just did even though they run on computing machinery whose isolated functional units are incapable of answering that same question.,2019-03-25T17:22:48.133,1269
14587,5488,1,Both are valid insights but that's the point. I think we have the habit of treating programming as if it is distinctly hard  Learning in general is hard. Suggesting that programming is distinctly harder than physics foreign languages playing an instrument etc scares away capable people. Just calling it easy doesn't do it justice either.   Marosh Fatima's heart is in the right place. Many students have the notion that CS is too hard or they don't belong and won't give it a proper chance. Replacing that attitude with a growth mindset like @CharlotteDungan suggested should help.,2019-03-25T20:31:32.503,6746
14588,5485,0,_@SolomonSlow I did not say that we could not program a simulation.,2019-03-25T20:43:21.390,204
14591,5485,0,I think you misunderstood me. I meant to call attention to the huge number of layers of abstraction that come between what digital circuits in a computer system do and what a software application running on that platform can do. All modern computers are Turing complete. So if you think that Turing completeness is sufficient to support AI then there's no reason to drill down through all of those layers to explain it. But maybe you think that Turing complete==stupid (i.e. not sufficient to support _real_ intelligence.) If so then maybe you could explain why.,2019-03-26T12:48:56.837,1269
14592,5485,0,_@SolomonSlow Oh good point. I was wondering a few weeks ago ?€?Is Turing complete enough?€? ?€? I still don't know. However my self-awareness dose not go down to the lowest level so maybe a Turing complete machine can be aware of its higher levels but like me not its lower levels.,2019-03-26T13:48:19.620,204
14596,5490,1,Thanks for the reply. I should clarify that in the certificate program they get experience with both. The question is more about which is better to start with.,2019-03-26T19:01:30.820,6746
14600,5495,0,This sounds like a really good idea and something that is in line with my learning style. I do see one issue however. That is that for Vulkan in particular there is a *lot* of background that is needed to do something even at a hello world level. I've seen posts that claim that you need over 1000 lines of code to draw a triangle. This background makes an approach where I look for specific things less useful as I won't know what specific things to look for.,2019-03-27T01:37:26.897,6762
14601,5498,1,The comment about tutorials is valid for many hastily-put-together articles found on the web often written by someone who is no expert and wants to share what he/she has just learned. But there are also tutorials that are very carefully designed crafted and reviewed by experts. You need to be able to recognise the difference.,2019-03-27T10:21:43.727,2936
14603,5498,1,_@MichaelKay I've added an exceptions notwithstanding. As a counterexample to your counterexample I'll mention a once de-facto Ruby-on-Rails tutorial which was in fact a very long and extremely well written e-book/website. Both didactically great; written in clean and well understandable tone. Exactly what you propose. The problem? It is for Rails 3. Rails 4+ are radically different. Most of the info in that tutorial is not only replaced by more modern stuff but doesn't work anymore outright. The problem? As it's so good it still often turns up quite high in searches and it is really...,2019-03-27T12:17:01.777,652
14604,5498,0,... tempting and easy to fall into the trap of using/studying it; eventually getting ever more and more confused due to the fact that things mysteriously fail to work over time. But really worst of all; even the parts that still work follow an outdated mode of operation for several parts of that ecosystem. All in all a developer following that as his main source at the beginning sets out with a (in part radically) wrong understanding laying plenty of obstacles in the way.,2019-03-27T12:18:27.840,652
14605,5498,0,Yes out-of-date information is always a problem on the web.,2019-03-27T12:53:06.820,2936
14609,5495,1,_@john01dav hmm that *is* frustrating. I guess maybe you need to recalibrate what hello world looks like for vulkan then? I don't know enough about Vulkan to be able to provide specific advice but maybe you're doing something that doesn't draw anything on the screen but sets something up in the background - anything really (is there something in vulkan that acts as console.log or print for debugging?). It's just got to start small so you can start seeing results quickly.,2019-03-27T13:39:54.913,919
14610,5492,0,These aren't exactly answers (hence a comment) but here's some discussion about similar academic questions: (1) [How to stop hopping the learning chain and actually begin somewhere?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/89032/70557) (2) [How to read papers without falling into a rabbit hole?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/68605/70557),2019-03-27T14:16:15.523,4995
14611,5495,0,_@john01dav these challenges are part of the reason why people build rendering/game/graphics engines on top of standards like Vulcan/OpenGL/DirectX. Its *hard* to understand and do all this stuff and while knowledge is always useful understanding exactly what goes into 1000 lines of boilerplate might have a lower payoff than something else.,2019-03-27T21:32:51.367,3457

14615,5483,0,_@philipxy strikes me that while the syntax between Python and R are a bit different neither the syntax nor semantics are wildly different when it comes to most intro to DS topics.

14618,5495,0,_@mbrig OpenGL takes nowhere near as much boilerplate and can be easily encapsulated it takes < 100 lines to draw a triangle with textures I often find it easier to work in OpenGL than higherlevel engines because now I not only need to know how what is going on with rendering I have to understand this upper level API that restrict things (unless it is a framework that doesn't restrict access to rendering).,2019-03-28T15:31:59.810,3168
14619,5495,0,_@heather  Vulkan requires a *looooooot* of other concepts orthogonal to rendering to even get started you need to understand multi process synchronization and message passing (semaphores mutexes event synchronization etc...) intermediate representation of a language (SPIR-V) memory management in addition to everything you had to know about graphics for other APIs.  Swap chain management and synchronization memory management with uniforms images and how to use commands properly are what really trip people up. This is required no matter the size of your project.,2019-03-28T15:37:31.800,3168

14632,5480,0,Hi @CharlotteDungan just FYI I sent this question on to two people who teach A.I. in the k-12 space both started writing answers and both stopped because they felt like the question was too broad (ie. would take too much effort to write a proper response). This question is absolutely topical but you might want to break it up into smaller separate questions to obtain more answers.,2019-03-29T18:32:09.640,27
14633,5511,2,Welcome to [cse.se]. Sorry to learn that you've got such an issue in your class. Seems completely counter to the school's purposes. Unfortunately while it does involve the a CS classroom it's not really about CS education _per se_. I cannot think of any other place in the network where it would fit either. Of course I'm no expert on every site here either. Glad to have you here on our site nonetheless.,2019-03-30T18:53:47.613,104

14636,349,2,FYI: The traditional meaning of hello world has nothing to do with learning a new language (or a first language). It always was about learning a new _toolchain_. It was not a program that you wrote for yourself; It was a program that somebody gave to you. As in Here when you can get this known-good source code to compile and run then you will be ready to compile and run something of your own.,2019-03-31T19:51:02.220,1269

14639,5259,0,The thing I find perplexing is the question of what a person is doing at a university if they don't already know what they want to learn and do? I knew I was interested in computers programming and especially operating systems since 9th grade. So my college courses were not 'difficult' (they were but I didn't care) they were what I wanted to spend my waking moments doing. I never did end up working at Microsoft but I had an interesting job. If you want to do something the issue of difficulty does not arise. If you don't want it that much find something that you do want.,2019-04-01T10:21:27.143,5349

14644,5511,0,In discussion with the other moderators we have reopened this question so that it can receive answers again.  When there is time I will open up a meta about it; my view is that this is completely topical but clearly there is some discussion to be had.  If you do choose to post it at Academia anyway (which I would understand) please delete it here since questions are not supposed to be asked simultaneously in more than one SE forum.   That said I hope that the question does well here. I think it's an important one for this forum and one that needs to be considered *in this context.*,2019-04-03T20:27:21.417,27
14645,5511,0,_@Embarrassedtenuredprofessor good question but can you provide a little more context? Are they being rude in just informal settings or are the students supposed to be interacting (in teamwork peer instruction etc)?,2019-04-04T03:27:42.300,6746

14649,371,1,In my quest for discovering what really makes mutations so hard I'm leaning towards these exact ideas. It's the *hiding of the gears* that plays a major role. It probably came to be to simplify the material to have the student not deal with too low level registers and instructions but I suspect that a low level intro would make things much clearer. Might be that or might be some nice interface that makes the execution visible. But it's important to picture the *execution* not the code which is what instead I see getting quite a lot of attention.,2019-04-05T10:08:43.470,6546

14666,5523,0,_@hinamunir if you have experience with other OOP language(s) Java should be relatively easy to learn. You can adopt Java by creating an Android application. [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/) has a tutorial and there are others available. However this stack exchange isn't generically about computer science or programming it is for CS *educators* -- we are people who teach computer science (at various educational levels) and discuss techniques for teaching. It seems like your question is probably more appropriate in a forum for Java or software development in general.,2019-04-08T20:30:04.197,6746
14667,5528,2,The spirit of CR is different than most other sites. On CR it is expected that what is posted is a completely operational example rather than a broken one that needs repair. The answers are not how to fix the code but how to make it better. They critique the code under what ever guidelines each person chooses. A better way to do the same thing or a more standard's compliant variation or any number of other points have been addressed. The catch is that before posting the code as written _works_.

14670,5531,0,Definitely. Why the heck use a linked list structure + free list inside a fixed size array (list) where an array + index of the top is sufficient - and is the most common low-level implementation?

14672,5532,0,Interesting. Heaps are not part of the syllabus and when I showed my students the code today they were totally baffled. It took me several hours of thinking and tracing to understand it myself. Since we are talking about A Level (pre university) study I think it's fair to conclude that the code is not level-appropriate. It would take considerable experience with a fairly low level language to be able to write this from scratch which is one of the exercises in the text book. The question is - what can I do about it? Maybe just emphasize the key features and/or contact the exam board?,2019-04-09T13:08:13.257,6843

14688,654,0,I believe they are measuring both your ability to create syntactically correct code as much as they are testing your ability to create the semantically correct solution. Saying syntax is secondary depends on the class; in algorithm theory and pseudocode yes in basics of programming no. Of course syntax errors aren't as severe as flaws in semantics but they're still errors. In basics of programming 1 we were using `nano` which is basically notepad as our IDE for C. I think it helped. And it made just as much sense to get such little help during the tests.,2019-04-12T02:03:41.100,6850

14745,5558,1,Your statement that polymorphism is not that useful for real concrete applications is both false and naive. It implies you don't understand what polymorphism is so it is hard for you to judge what might be a good example. In particular animals is a particularly bad idea until you realize that all of the polymorphism in the Linnaeus taxonomy is interface (not concrete) polymorphism. There are no instantiations of the Mammal class for example. There are individual tigers and mice of course but Mammal is  better thought of as an an interface.,2019-04-21T12:59:52.457,1293
14746,5553,0,Hey I have a dial telephone sitting on a shelf but nothing to plug it in to. Give it a few years then computers will no longer even have screens or keyboards because most of what we need can be done with voice as a million years of evolution sans reading has demonstrated. It is being done with voice and increasingly will be. The question what is a file? will no longer have any referent or anything to prompt it. Files and screens were a temporary phase like telephone dials and switchboard operators.,2019-04-21T13:41:33.123,5349
14748,5559,0,I'll note that this is actually an instance of the Strategy design pattern. It like other simple design patterns often makes use of polymorphism but it is usually interface rather than concrete polymorphism. Objects of different classes can be interchanged (polymorphism) when they all have _exactly_ the same public interface. Other sorts of ad-hoc subclassing is just a form of hacking. The OP is cautioned not to confuse subclassing with polymorphism. They are not equivalent.,2019-04-21T14:32:25.190,1293
14749,5559,0,_@Buffy I haven't knowingly used polymorphism in prior work but perhaps I was doing the same thing according to what made sense to me at the time.  Experience can lead people to conclusions just as well as teaching can. But I have to wonder if programming really is Engineering in some sense then why do we expect masses of people to learn it? Few people dabble in helicopter piloting or brain surgery and with so much riding on programming these days (everything basically) and soon we will be riding IN programming and self-learning programs at that why try to interest everyone in doing it?,2019-04-21T15:55:46.437,5349

14767,5552,1,_@LogicalBranch Sure. Humans usually make meaning by relating to things in their environment. The floppy disk is the icon for 'store' because they used to be commonplace. But to someone who has never seen one it doesn't have any inherent meaning. If a student is asking what a file is it probably means they have no referent no commonplace objects situations and processes that they can intuitively substitute. If all of computing is strewn with metaphors and references to never-before-known things it is basically like going to a foreign planet and trying to start from nothing.,2019-04-22T11:12:35.917,5349

14778,5562,0,Thanks for your example. By the way your rant is well-founded and even more the following observation.,2019-04-22T16:09:50.690,3842
14779,5558,0,Don't overlook testing! Polymorphism in its purest form means defining an interface that can be implemented by two or more different classes. I have often defined an interface that was implemented by only one class in the finished program but which was implemented by one or more other classes (a.k.a. _[test doubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double)_) in the _[test suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)_.,2019-04-22T16:24:11.063,1269
14780,5567,0,Unfortunately this will instill lots of bad habits in programmers destined to be C++ programmers. You really want to avoid that. Don't teach things that need to be un-learned later. This goes beyond just heap management actually.,2019-04-22T16:34:39.400,1293

14783,5567,0,_@Buffy what's your opinion based on? I'd argue one shouldn't learn C++ before C which is I'm proposing. Linux kernel is written in better C,2019-04-22T17:06:05.083,6827
14784,5567,0,Modern C++ has different idioms than C or early C++. There is no need to learn C first and it will cause you mental anguish to switch. There is no more need to learn C before C++ than to learn it before Java. If you want to be a linux kernel programmer then learn C by all means - even first. But not if you want to move to being a good C++ programmer without wasted effort and turmoil.,2019-04-22T17:10:27.693,1293
14786,5552,0,+1 @ScottRowe Just watch out for the dangerous things - this reminded me of theme in Heinlein's Tunnel in the Sky: the kids are sent to a remote planet and among other things are told to watch out for stobor. They weren't told how this *stobor* looks like and what can it do. Interestingly this seemed to work but I'm not throwing spoilers here :),2019-04-22T18:57:18.383,6827

14788,5470,0,No matter what you do NOT start with Git! It's worst kind of revision control for a beginner. It actually doesn't make any sense in the classroom setup. Start with something basic maybe even rsync to get an idea of what this is and why one needs it,2019-04-22T19:26:32.170,6827
14789,5567,1,_@Buffy the reason I'm proposing to start with C is because it's simple enough to not distract from the objective of the first programming class: learn data structures and algorithms. for instance you learn an array in its most basic form closest to how it's implemented in hardware. you can focus on the essence of programming with C. also starting close to hardware and OS helps in future development of a programmer in my opinion.,2019-04-22T20:20:46.857,6827
14790,5559,0,_@SolomonSlow It is a sad world when they cannot get jobs after going to college so both objectives must be met. What I have been reading on this site is that many students cannot write a simple program after several years of instruction. That is even more sad.,2019-04-22T22:08:50.053,5349
14791,5470,0,_@Aksakal - Does rsync run on Windows? Students want access to their work from home and the ability to collaborate in class. Could you expand on what you see as the problems are with Git and GitHub?,2019-04-22T22:49:55.917,134
14792,104,0,_@Aksakal - my big goal is to have the demographics of my classes match those of my school. What I mean by CS types are people who are comfortable doing computational thinking - so in part my question is about how you encourage people who may not see themselves as nerds to explore the possibility. One aspect of this is designing classes that encourage exploration and where success isn't predicated on natural CS talent.,2019-04-23T00:46:07.543,134
14793,5567,0,This is the basic division of opinion on this site. Well at least there are two of us holding the same view now...,2019-04-23T00:49:13.723,5349

14795,5518,0,_@dlu I'm with Linus Torvalds on this: the kids need to be exposed to CS then they decide if they want to pursue it. I think it's mainly K-12's objective to expose kids to all different fields and see what sticks. You need good teachers though. We had a crappy chemistry teacher and all that exposure to the subject was wasted. Otherwise it's an interesting subject and I could see myself liking it under different circumstances.,2019-04-23T01:38:29.207,6827
14796,104,0,_@dlu the nerd is a silly stereotype. I suppose I would fit it but a few of my friends did not. They weren't exactly jocks but more like normal boys and girls who just happened to like programming. I sense that by demographics you don't mean mere appearance bit something else. I don't know if there's natural CS talent. What I see is that some people like it and end up spending a lot of time doing it and become very skillful. Maybe the way to accomplish your goal is to promote the idea that there's no CS type and that everyone can do it if they like it.,2019-04-23T01:44:33.400,6827
14797,5567,1,_@ScottRowe it's actually not my idea. I believe it was one of the C inventors who said that the success of C was due to it being close enough to hardware and OS architecture to how things actually work in a computer. I learned C++ when it was a pre-processor for C compiler not a real compiler but don't code in it a lot these days. It's a great and powerful language too rich to get into all its paradigms at once when first learning it. So sticking to its core C is a sound way to start its exploration,2019-04-23T01:54:00.230,6827
14798,5474,0,OK maybe I'm just a contrarian but the approach that I take is to validate the experience that programming is sometimes hard - I consider programming a game that never gets old. I never feel it's hard inherently the only thing that makes it hard is the deadlines when you do it for money.,2019-04-23T01:59:00.093,6827
14799,5567,0,I don't know what these bad habits are that people are concerned will have to be unlearned later. If I knew that perhaps I could make a reply. The only thing that has to be unlearned is something that was incorrect all along. How things actually work can never be wrong or distracting or misleading. It is the definition of knowledge to learn what is.,2019-04-23T11:28:55.940,5349
14800,5566,0,_@buffy no sensible person writes directly in C they use a framework perhaps one they have built. That doesn't make C bad or to be avoided. Domain Specific Languages have been around a long time and they are as far as I can tell the best approach to writing a system. Something like Windows is really a large library thus a kind of DSL. Pretty successful so far. But reading the actual C is how we know how it achieves these results.,2019-04-23T11:33:31.950,5349
14801,5568,0,Haskell as a first language is an insane approach. It?€?s probably older than C. So it?€?s not clear to me why would you suggest it after promoting modern C++. The same goes for scala which also quite old and impossible to debug. Both would be a nightmare to start with and certainly teach very bad habits. You can see this on folks who started with Java a lot of them write wasteful and inefficient code,2019-04-23T12:22:31.170,6827
14802,5568,0,Hmmm @Aksakal so the age of the language is determinative? A lot of C programmer write extremely dangerous code. What is your point exactly?,2019-04-23T12:26:34.957,1293
14803,5568,0,The comment was on Haskell really. Do you know a good programmer who really started with Haskell? They don?€?t exist. So you are suggesting a really unproven approach if not outrageous.,2019-04-23T13:02:58.157,6827
14804,5568,0,Do I infer correctly that you believe the the only worthy goal is to become a skilled C programmer? Sorry if my disagreement with that stance offends you so deeply. I like Haskell for what it _is_ and for the mental model it engenders. I might have said _Scheme_ actually but personally prefer languages with more syntax as a guide to the student. I know I can't convince you. I'm not trying actually.,2019-04-23T13:18:33.870,1293
14805,5570,0,Thank you. I'll update my question.,2019-04-24T03:48:52.990,283
14806,5568,1,_@Aksakal it only takes 30 seconds on Wikipedia to find out when Haskell dates from so why not invest that effort before spouting inaccurate guesses? Also FWIW Cambridge University's first teaching language is SML which is not entirely dissimilar to Haskell.,2019-04-24T08:53:21.920,1219
14809,4797,1,You could say that most of the world around us might as well be a vast collection of global constants and methods that we either are not aware of at all or at least not allowed to run. Finding something that actually *responds* is probably most of a baby's first 2 years of existence. So Procedural makes sense in that way. And we don't just line up grocery shopping cooking and washing dishes and push one button and walk away with a full belly and clean new kitchen we have to push and pull every object and verify that every dish is clean.

14814,5567,1,_@MichelBillaud I don't know what would be my choice for the very first programming language these days. OP is not asking about it. OP wants to teach C++ for some reason and all I'm suggesting is to start with better C part of C++ the multi-paradigm language. Linus started with BASIC not Visual Basic. BASIC used to come with all computers such as Commodor and was something like C to Unix i.e. it was very close to hardware architecture. You could read/write directly into memory for instance.

14834,5580,8,I'll note that some of the things you learn in elementary calculus are in your answer 1 list: sets logic especially quantifiers and proofs. I'll also note that you had a dilemma a while back about something you wanted to do with your advanced students that became more complicated because they hadn't had calculus. I can't recall the details.,2019-04-27T20:29:03.713,1293
14835,5580,6,_@Buffy I hadn't realized that those topics were taught in calculus. I don't think that's universally true. I believe our students' not having calculus was a problem when we wanted to teach electives on computer graphics and machine learning.,2019-04-27T20:32:51.073,283
14836,5580,9,This. Definitely this. But to have the flip answer down as well I'm physicist by training and a programmer by trade and I *do* use my calc/diff-equ fairly regularly. Mostly *not* to do raw numeric work but to reduce the domain problem to something more suited to programatic solutions (that is I do analytic solutions to improve the computability of the way we express the domain problem). So there are corners of the programming world where that stuff is useful but it is certainly not a large part of the wider field.,2019-04-27T22:52:58.763,2735
14838,5580,2,with the exceotion of inductive proof and matrices those were not in the calculus course I did but rather (witht ehfurthe exception of probability) were in the discrete mathematics course (which was a requirement for CS),2019-04-27T23:58:42.277,4518
14839,5580,13,To add to both of your Answer 2's: (a) Generally one wants to develop mathematical maturity and calculus is 1 way to do this; (b) Many math curricula are set up quasi-linearly so that Calc I and Calc II are the first courses you take beyond high school math.  At my university they are prerequisites for Discrete Math and Linear Algebra not because they are logical prerequisites but because we want some baseline of mathematical maturity for students in those classes.,2019-04-28T01:37:07.373,7919
14841,5579,1,Why don't they learn it in high school? I did. The only mathematics I did in CS was the basics of twos-complement and floating-point and a semester of numerical programming. But then it was 48 years ago ...,2019-04-28T06:19:18.820,3202

14848,5579,1,Back in the early 1980s I had to take Calculus for CS. Thanks to SAT etc. I got into an advanced (very small class) Calculus. I had no idea what was going on. Those who did know what was going on got As. Those who didn't but tried (me) got Bs. After 3 semesters I switched to regular Calculus - and ended up with a C. Now I hardly remember **anything** from Calculus as I haven't needed to use it at all in > 35 years. Algebra logic - absolutely. Calculus - not one drop.,2019-04-28T14:31:55.403,2460
14849,5579,5,I don't think that will I use it is a good metric to evaluate whether you should take something.  Don't believe me? Talk to all those people who think that knowing states and capitals is important.,2019-04-28T17:40:27.100,5285
14851,5579,0,Since an answer has already been accepted I'll put my response here.  The obvious answer is you *may* need calculus; it depends where you end up working *after* you get your degree.  Employers want to hire grads who know their stuff; and if a given employer wants CS grads who know calculus they want to be able to find them.  (I myself took lots of math courses and some intro courses in civil engineering accounting and so on because I wanted to draw on that knowledge if one of my future employers needed it.)  But another answer ...,2019-04-28T18:18:21.920,7936
14852,5579,1,... is that calculus acts as a *barrier to entry* so not every Tom Dick and Harry gets that degree -- and so keeps salaries high.  (I'm not so sure that's true anymore with outsourcing and inverted corporations.)  I also went back to school and started on a business degree -- and I had to take statistics.  I don't see the relevance there but again it's a barrier to entry.  (Never did finish that business degree but so what?),2019-04-28T18:21:50.877,7936
14853,5584,19,This is all true.  Plus things change in the industry.  A different answerer here says she never used linear algebra.  Boy is that changing now in the AI/ML revolution. Most of number theory seemed pretty useless to working programmers. Until RSA appeared and remade crypto. Plus I didn't study category theory as a mathematics major in the 70's.  Don't even remember it being offered.  But given my strong interest in programming languages and software engineering I sure _now_ wish I had. In the future there may be _more_ uses for calculus by programmers than you've listed already.,2019-04-28T21:09:08.970,1301
14854,5592,1,My experience echos yours.  My CS degree was 40% mathematics I have *never* used calculus since.  Linear Algebra is the complete opposite though.,2019-04-29T03:56:47.300,7944
14855,5579,7,_@Jennifer Please don't use the comments for answers.

Would you mind copying your comments to an answer?,2019-04-29T04:15:09.607,58
14856,5586,1,Interesting perspective. I agree that we're entering an era where probability and statistics are increasingly important to applications of computer science. However let me play devil's advocate for a moment.  Do you really need to be able to compute differentiation to understand _rate of change_ as applied to concepts such as Big O?  Do you really need to be able to compute integrals to understand concepts that involve _area under the curve_ such as normal distributions? I have the gut feeling that these essential concepts can be understood without knowing how to calculate them with calc,2019-04-29T07:15:18.340,6746
14857,5580,2,As an aside: Don't assume BA == arts.  Cambridge and Oxford only offer BA degrees to scientists and engineers.,2019-04-29T08:04:14.327,4896
14858,5584,7,I'm not an educator but I am a CS major. What I've found is that you might not need calculus just for general CS tasks such as programming software design etc. But you absolutely DO need it in many cases when the company you're working for requires you to build software that revolves around calculations. It's far easier to do so if you do understand yourself what the math is supposed to look like instead of trying to just copy whatever the engineers/math people tell you to.,2019-04-29T08:52:07.780,7952
14861,5584,4,_@tfrascaroli Indeed.  I spent roughly 15 years in embedded software engineering having never needed anything more complicated than a simple 1st-order filter.  Then I started my current job.  Over the last few years (and still on the to-do list) are filter design and implementation in fixed-point FPGA code multi-stage PID control for position and velocity (with acceleration potentially in the mix later) feedforward trajectory shaping and multi-axis cubic-spline position linearisation.  I've used more maths in the last 5 years than in the entire rest of my career!,2019-04-29T10:54:49.980,1864
14862,5584,3,_@tfrascaroli ... What just occurred to me too is that when I was learning this stuff at uni they never made it seem relevant.  I actually had a conversation at uni with the engineering department head where he said This is not supposed to be a practical course.  We're teaching you what you think you should know not what will help you in your job. Of course he was kind of right but it was also an epic fail.  Engineers are hands-on people and if you can't show us an application then it's not likely to stick.  This does lead to the OP's problem of finding relevance if your teachers can't.,2019-04-29T11:01:51.400,1864
14863,5584,3,_@Graham That is the problem yes not that calculus is somehow irrelevant. That and teachers who don't even know themselves the practical applications of what they are teaching. They (mostly in my case) are mathematicians who know nothing about application and programming. I'm not saying they ought to they are theory-people. That's precisely not the kind of teachers you need in CS.,2019-04-29T12:36:18.320,7952
14864,5580,1,A related anecdote: Solving recursive equations into a closed form which is part of Discrete Mathematics is curiously similar to solving a differential equation. My knowledge in Calculus saved me here in university as I could not figure out for the life of me how to do it. Only after realizing the relation to differential equations and applying the Calculus knowledge from my Physics courses did it finally make sense to me. Math is not an island and neither is CS. There is no such thing as useless knowledge.,2019-04-29T13:57:27.560,1370
14865,5584,3,_@tfrascaroli Precisely.  My combinatorics class was exactly like that.  All of the examples were like If Bob can't stand next to Steve how many ways are there to arrange 10 people for a photo?  For the entire semester my thought was Who cares?!  Just line them up separate the fighters and take the picture already!  Then a substitute CS professor during dead week finally made it click.  It's not about lining people up for a photo; it's about calculation effort for a given algorithm.  Seems like the departments need to talk to each other a little better.,2019-04-29T17:19:31.503,759
14867,5586,0,_@KevinBuffardi sure you can understand them conceptually without knowing the technical side. But the formalism frustrating as it is exists for a reason; and to really understand even the simplest ML--not just neural nets--beyond an introductory article requires at least multivariable calculus and linear algebra. I'm about to graduate with an MS CS. and I still plan to spend the next few years learning more math because I'll need it to actually understand data science as a practitioner.,2019-04-29T17:53:45.287,7962
14868,5586,0,_@Tiercelet I won't contest that there are areas within CS that require sophisticated understanding of calculus. However the question is why _all_ computer science majors are _required_ to take calculus. Certainly it makes sense that you have taken advanced calc classes but what about a student who isn't getting an MS with a concentration in ML? Is there a compelling reason why every CS student should be required to take calculus whether they want to be a software developer UX specialist security analyst database administrator CS theory researcher etc?,2019-04-29T19:37:13.140,6746
14870,5586,3,_@KevinBuffardi Most university CS programs are intended to be preparation for further specialized or academic work--not just a learn to code experience. Distribution reqs exist so those who graduate from a program are exposed to its subfields & have a base for future work in a specialization (if any). Someone specializing in UX or computational theory also has no need to take a hardware class... Nor does a UX person have need of math--unless they want to work in mobile device sensors or analyze UX survey results & A/B testing or...,2019-04-29T21:07:33.873,7962
14872,5586,0,_@Tiercelet I agree that degree requirements are often designed to demonstrate a breadth in the discipline as well as prepare students to be lifelong learners. Many will go on to specialize in an area that doesn't directly use every single required class. However I think there are strong arguments that everyone should take a CS Theory class - even if they may never directly use it at their jobs - because the topic is vital to establishing a broad foundation in CS. Same goes for most required classes. However I honestly can't make the same argument for Calculus. Maybe you can?,2019-04-29T23:10:10.363,6746
14873,5586,0,Side note: as a former UX consultant (and now a professor) I've actually used _a ton_ of statistics in both roles. However I would make a similar argument for stat as calc -- they make sense as prereqs for certain electives and can be really useful in some applications but I can't make as strong an argument for them being fundamental to computer science as I can for Discrete Math (which I _do_ think every BS in CS should require) for example.,2019-04-29T23:14:45.997,6746
14874,5591,1,As a working developer who was assigned a task that required ML techniques to do well in a shop where the data scientists were all busy with more directly revenue-producing tasks I wouldn't suggest betting on domain-expert availability when those domain experts are more specialized / harder-to-come-by than you. And of course having that expertise entitles you to *become* one of those domain experts with the extra job-market pull that implies.,2019-04-29T23:37:05.543,5084
14875,5579,1,When I was at university many moons ago the joke was the calculus was meant to thin the field and make more Management Information Systems grads.

14881,5584,2,_@DDuck If educators can't explain the relevance of a concept then either they don't understand the concept or they don't understand how to educate. For school teachers it's often the former. For university lecturers my experience is that the vast majority couldn't teach a child to tie their shoelaces. Either way if students are still ignorant of the concept after taking the class the educator has failed abjectly and it's the educator who needs to change.,2019-04-30T10:10:09.093,1864
14882,5585,2,I feel like your second point is the one that isn't being stated enough. Being equipped with more tools than you need gives you more options when you encounter problems the old adage that when all you have is a hammer every problem starts to look like a nail is decidedly truthy. Ways of thinking are tools too.

14887,5584,0,_@DDuck That's not my experience at all.  When I'm tutoring if my student doesn't understand the application of what they're learning it's because I haven't taken the time to understand how it applies to them.  The same was true at the university level especially for CS and EE students where they are extremely application-oriented and could care less about theory that will never apply to them.,2019-04-30T19:50:01.957,744
14888,5584,1,_@Graham: It's an important general intellectual skill to be able to take something you have learned in one context and recognize *by yourself* its relevance in a different context.  (If it wasn't for this skill humanity would never figure out anything it hadn't already known.)  The point of math classes is to give you a chance to practice this skill - because math is precisely the discipline of taking facts out of context so they can be generalized.  This begins with 2+2=4 where we generalize adding two apples to two apples and walking two miles followed by walking two miles.,2019-04-30T20:19:15.907,7983

14895,5584,0,_@AlexanderWoo That's true enough but you've given a good example of how critically important it is to have the concept taught in at least one recognisable context. You can only generalise a concept you already understand. The idea that you can teach out of context and then parachute in the various contexts has long been proved to not work. Students who do learn learn *in spite of* this so-called teaching and always by finding themselves some practical application which ties the concepts to a context.,2019-04-30T22:11:12.587,1864
14896,5584,1,_@Graham: I find that I *cannot* learn a concept in the context of an application because any application worthy of the name inevitably has many distracting details which obscure the concept.  Also in the context of an application it's very hard to tell what it is in the application makes the concept not apply perfectly so you never get the pure form only an approximation.  I can *only* understand a concept completely in a toy situation.  But then again I'm a pure mathematician.,2019-04-30T23:28:59.367,7983
14897,5584,1,_@Graham: I should add - back when I worked in technology consulting it was precisely the people who could not learn in an abstract setting who could not jump into a project and contribute on day 1 - they needed to spend a month learning the whole context of the project and the technologies used before even doing a relatively independent task.  Given that the projects might only be a month or two long people like that were mostly useless - and tended not to stay with the company.,2019-04-30T23:50:31.857,7983

14902,5607,0,It may be a little mean but I have to ask:  Can you define rigorous rigorously?  As is you defined it using an analogy.

14905,5612,0,While correct this might be a bit subtle for some folks to grok. It is a question about _where_ polymorphism is most useful. It turns out to be a great way to build small things that are composed to build bigger things. Think of the sort as being composed of two things: an algorithm that is agnostic about comparisons and a comparator that is all about that but nothing else. Used this way polymorphism can be superior to explicit testing to introduce variability into a process.,2019-05-03T11:23:15.740,1293

14907,5612,0,_@Buffy whether it is subtle or not is partly down to what language is used to teach. If polymorphism is taught in terms of a basic mental model of parametric types then it's blatant rather than subtle. Chalk one up to SML.,2019-05-03T12:53:54.137,1219

14920,5619,0,Yes first teach un-plugged away from the computer. Link it to what they already know then translate into a program then into a programming language.,2019-05-05T08:46:51.693,204
14921,5621,0,@GypsySpellweaver. You misread it. unique for any given first element. {(52) (54)} is not a function but  {(52) (62)} IS a function. For the first element 5 the second element is not unique in the first set (a relation) but it is unique (for any given first element) in the second set and therefore a function.,2019-05-05T10:28:30.577,1293
14923,5618,0,Note that CS Unplugged is actually a thing. Some of my students have been involved in these concepts: https://csunplugged.org/en/,2019-05-05T12:28:41.580,1293
14924,5618,0,_@Buffy I love that resource but I don't mean only that: If they don't provide a resource then you may have to create your own or get it from else where.,2019-05-05T12:45:13.487,204
14926,5624,0,His students got tripped up by the fact that basic math functions are generally continuous.  It's just a failure of imagination that's all and there's no need to draw a distinction between computer functions and math functions; they're all the same.,2019-05-05T15:19:14.520,882
14927,5624,0,_@RobertHarvey They are and they aren't the same. The problem with viewing them as the same is that you must ignore all of the metaphor along the way.  A true Random if it existed would *not* fit under any formal definition of a mathematical function and a computer function that takes no arguments prints hello to the console sets `x` to 3 launches a network connection to nasa.gov and returns `PI` is a little hard to characterize. What are the domains and codomains exactly? Calling it a mathematical function serves no models of thinking particularly well in that instance.,2019-05-05T19:09:16.210,27
14928,5624,0,Well to be fair most Random functions aren't truly random; they are pseudo-random a sequence of numbers given a specific starting value (a seed) as input.  But even if they were truly random the distribution of the numbers could still be described mathematically.,2019-05-05T21:29:56.180,882
14929,5624,0,_@RobertHarvey Described mathematically does not a function make. If we *had* a true Random generator (which of course we don't) it would be a non-function by definition as the same input would generate a different output. But my real objection is the second one that we really don't utilize computer functions in ways that are easily described as mathematical functions. How would you describe the computer function I mentioned in my prior comment?,2019-05-05T22:52:13.887,27
14930,5624,0,_@BenI. Your prior example of a function is not a function it is a procedure or algorithm. Some languages differentiate between the two most no longer do. The prints hello and connecting to the network are side effects while the setting `x` to 3 is both a mutation and a side effect. Relative to the _function_ it takes two arguments and returns `PI`. Programmatically the rest are important as well as bad form but they are not part of the _function_.,2019-05-06T00:32:35.237,104
14932,5627,0,Why do you want to do this if only about half of the people are interested? Give them a handout they can follow and use face-time for something more useful. Even those interested are likely to do this only once or twice so it isn't really a useful skill I think.,2019-05-07T12:42:16.427,1293
14933,5627,0,A hands on version is unlikely to be short with 30 students. People will get stuck. They will get stuck at different points. They will have questions. The questions will all be different and require answers. This will take time. Use the time more productively even if it is essential that they get a server working to continue other work.,2019-05-07T12:54:59.953,1293
14934,5627,0,And why a commercial service with no free tier for students? I'd strongly suggest that you rethink this whole thing. Sorry to be so negative.,2019-05-07T13:42:21.760,1293
14935,5627,0,Thanks for the comments! Not negative at all. There are good reasons to use DO. But I take your point that it probably is pointless to do it live.,2019-05-07T14:04:43.350,275
14936,5627,0,_@Buffy Are you aware of any (commercial or not) service which has a free tier for students? Digital Ocean makes an effort to be easy to use and has currently a 60 day try-out period where one can spend 100$ which is usually more than enough for a small project. AWS and Google have similar offers but they aren't as easy to use (imho).,2019-05-08T19:13:40.363,8006
14937,5627,0,I don't know of others. But my first inclination would be to go to my university's IT department and see what they could do. I assume that there are open source solutions if you can find the hosting space and the back-end support. Not every school would be able to help with that of course.,2019-05-08T19:21:43.097,1293
14938,5634,0,I'm already familiar with CS Unplugged but I didn't know Creative Computing which seems quite inspiring! Thank you very much Buffy for the suggestions.,2019-05-08T19:58:00.850,8005
14939,5633,1,I don't entirely understand what you're asking here. Are you asking for resources for age-appropriate lessons?,2019-05-08T20:06:26.150,27
14940,5633,0,Not exactly even if interesting and useful links are always appreciated. I would like to know how other people (CS educators professors teachers researchers) have dealt with this didactic problem in primary schools: if they encounter difficulties and why or which kind of path they suggest to follow which learning methods they used (e.g. cooperative learning classical lesson with the blackboard etc.).,2019-05-08T20:08:19.057,8005
14941,5607,0,This doesn't even approach an issue of rigour--it is unclear. Even correct use of the expected technical term contiguous here would be unclear if it hadn't been previously defined for this sort of context ie as a technical term.,2019-05-08T22:20:01.817,2485
14942,5630,1,If you have poor knowledge of the language (excepting particularly weird languages like prolog and awk) this is not a problem for teaching learning and lesson construction just so long as you have some CS proficiency including programming in another language. The difficulty will be when you come to mark the work and more particularly in lab practicals where you will need to *quickly* spot errors in student code.,2019-05-09T20:19:05.120,8007
14943,5635,2,Sorry but you have a profound misunderstanding about grammars and especially LL(1). The int x convention is no harder to parse with LL(1) than the pascal convention. But if your grammar is not LL(1) it is in principle harder for humans to parse than if it is. Most compilers use LR techniques (at least) but that is due to efficiency not the nature of the language. An LR parser needs to evaluate more of a statement to make a prediction about the meaning than is necessary with an LL(1) language. Don't confuse the structure of the language with the type of compiler typically used.,2019-05-09T20:26:07.727,1293
14944,5635,2,But yes Pascal is old and has a few flaws. Being LL(1) (mostly) isn't one of them. In fact a language that has dangling else issues isn't LL(1) which is why it requires special rules to match else clauses. It is also why nested if statements often confuse students. It is also why I require students to always fully brace every such if and else clause. Modula 2 is LL(1) but avoids this issue by requiring end for such clauses. But again. LR is an advantage for compiling efficiency but NOT - definitely NOT - for understanding.,2019-05-09T20:30:22.243,1293
14946,5635,0,The left or right factoring affects the feel of the language syntax and most programmers today will be using languages with right factored grammars because the compilers they use will have been constructed using automatic tools which rely on the LR parsing algorithm. I am pointing to this fact to explain *why* pascal has a clunky feel for learners used to right factored grammars having been invented before the LR algorithm was known.,2019-05-09T21:05:30.127,8007
14947,5635,3,Actually I taught compilers for 20 years. I also taught language principles for the same amount of time. There are automated tools for LL parsers also. The single lookahead is actually a massive advantage for a human reading a program. It is less important for an automated tool. If you can read a program one token at a time (rather than needing to backtrack) you have a big mental advantage. Again. languages should be LL(1) preferably. Compilers should be efficient.,2019-05-09T21:05:55.007,1293
14948,5568,0,From the question it is clear that the learners have no programming experience and so it will be important to introduce the *basic concepts* of sequence iteration and condition along with simple data types. Later one can introduce function call and structured types with a possible discussion of OOP and type inheritance at the end of the course. I also not that according to the question these learners are engineers and medical students. It is therefore unlikely that they will become professional programmers.,2019-05-09T21:42:37.197,8007
14949,5567,0,I note that the learners are destined to become engineers or to work in medicine. They are certainly not destined to become professional C++ programmers. They are learning some software development to gain an understanding of issues such as how software works how expensive and time consuming it is to write etc. This is not their main course focus on fun.,2019-05-09T21:47:46.203,8007
14950,5636,0,Supposedly Lambda Calculus is a pure theory of functions -- and yes supposedly anything function-wise in a LC-based programming language can be considered real math functions because they're built from LC. If we stick to e.g. Haskell then I believe we don't have to worry about your instrumentation functions -- or at least the Haskell folks have a workaround/explanation.,2019-05-10T04:01:06.053,7996
14951,5636,0,A good point excepting that not all programming languages are purely functional and it is unlikely that beginners will use Haskell. Without wishing to extend the discussion into technicalities outside the range of discourse one could argue that functions in programming are more akin to operators in mathematics than functions in mathematics. Of course as you say this all depends on the language to some extent.,2019-05-10T10:01:02.433,8007
14952,5644,0,What country are you asking about?  And note that in some places the terms are used interchangeably.,2019-05-10T11:00:19.017,1293
14953,5644,3,I'm referring to US ABET accredited programs.,2019-05-10T11:09:56.413,8012
14954,5644,0,If all you want to do is code depending on what you want to do and where you live you could look into a good coding boot camp as a way of getting some of the necessary skills in a fraction of the time and expense. I was initially skeptical of those but have come to realize that the better ones have some genuine worth.,2019-05-10T13:24:20.043,2715
14956,5644,1,Learn how to break problems down into smaller problems learn a few programming languages (especially if they have different syntax or different approaches ie functional vs. object) and take some courses in communications (writing speaking). Those are the critical skills -- the degree is just the employer's easy way to check that you can stick through a commitment.,2019-05-10T13:57:41.677,4902
14957,5645,6,What to build is a domain knowledge issue and I've never heard of a degree program that can help with that. And you'd better know how to build software if you want to solve problems with software.,2019-05-10T13:59:17.620,4902
14958,5645,2,_@RobCrawford I'm also concerned with ethics is what _should_ be built and what not.,2019-05-10T14:18:31.507,1293
14959,5645,0,I don't think college is the place to learn that either. Some of history's most horrendous acts have been carried out by crowds of the well-educated all convinced they were doing the correct thing. For that I'd just encourage people to read think and learn; find people you believe are acting ethically confirm that they actually are and learn what guides them.,2019-05-10T14:26:42.610,4902
14960,5417,0,For the majority of the history of CS design patterns hadn't been discovered. At least the term. Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs was the closest I remember from college.,2019-05-10T14:29:03.020,4902
14961,5648,1,I think the actual course components really are the most important factor when deciding. back when i did my undergraduate in Electronics engineering my Computer Science buddies actually did less coding than me because we had more coding  modules and they had more Computer science theory modules.   But in my software engineering masters we did more theory than the compsci masters did so it really all does boil down to the modules.,2019-05-10T14:55:29.407,8016
14962,5438,0,Proof of concept code is exactly that - it's a proof of concept. It's up to software engineers to grok it and make it beautiful. If only I could convince our R&D department of that!,2019-05-10T14:56:33.933,4902
14963,5645,6,_@RobCrawford There are plenty of degree courses to help with what to build. Engineering (any branch) biophysics any liberal arts subject (if you are interested in textual analysis) sport science (e.g. motion tracking and human physiology) economics etc etc. Learning how to code is the simple part compared with knowing what to code - it's not worth devoting a whole degree to just the how to topic.,2019-05-10T14:57:47.173,1352
14964,5644,1,Just a personal anecdote: My university's Software Engineering was a specialization of the B.S in Computer Science (and was awarded as a B.S Computer Science Software Engineering) The SE emphasis required additional core classes that were left as optional electives to CS students. If you can't find a similar program you could always just take the CS course and choose SE related electives e.g. software architecture life-cycles forward engineering UML technical writing etc.,2019-05-10T15:44:58.973,2386
14965,5644,1,Back in the day there was **only** computer Science** -- which I majored in.  Then I started hearing about software engineering.  I always thought they were the same thing.,2019-05-10T16:34:27.080,7936
14966,5644,1,Real world experience is going to teach you much more than most university courses would anyway regardless of the focus.,2019-05-10T18:29:49.963,981
14970,5652,1,I don't agree. I think the appropriate level is more PhD or at least Masters today. Just because some courses are poor doesn't make them worse than no course at all and frankly the non graduate programmers I have managed have not usually been up to the tasks set. Online resources are a revolution but it is very useful to know where to look and what to look for. It is hard for a person who learns from online tutorials to catch up with a person who goes directly to the technical documentation for example.,2019-05-10T22:15:10.983,8007
14971,5648,0,I think the point about mindset is a really good one. The difference between the two strands is one of perspective attitude and direction. On a degree scheme this gets deeply embedded - for life!,2019-05-10T22:17:30.430,8007
14972,5645,0,I agree with your answer if the important thing is personal status and self importance. I think that depends largely on one's personality. Coding can be very rewarding for people who like coding. Managing can be very rewarding for people who like to manage. Reading the words of the questioner I get the impression that there is a definite interest in coding *because it's enjoyable*.,2019-05-10T22:25:26.257,8007
14973,5656,1,Hmmm. I value my liberal arts degree pretty highly. There are things other than money of course.,2019-05-10T22:37:02.807,1293
14974,5654,2,This is more or less the advice I got from a hiring manager at a big gaming developer: CS grads can do basically any development job. With a specialized degree (to include SE & Game Development) there are tasks they have more experience out the door with but there are also tasks they are likely unable to do without going to substantial additional training. The examples she used was game engine/netcode development because both rely heavily on low-level mathematics/theory work which is usually lacking in specialized programs. There is plenty of room for both but CS will give you more options.,2019-05-10T23:03:01.430,807
14976,5645,3,No I didn't mean software development in general. I meant just coding. Torvalds is much more than a coder. And of course every rule has an exception but that exception being rare isn't likely to be you.,2019-05-11T00:00:00.590,1293
14978,5644,2,One thing I have to say as someone who went through college and has a successful career as a developer going don't go to college expecting to get good at coding. They *will* teach you everything badly and you'll need to start (almost) from scratch when you start programming for the real world; I got that experience from OSS projects. Programming in the real world is way different than studying isolated concepts in school. OTOH college won't hurt your career as long as you don't buy what they teach hook line and sinker. Good luck!,2019-05-11T02:43:44.660,4991
14979,5656,0,Quite right too! Didn't meant to offend. I just meant that I was surprised how snobby the Europeans can be about North American style major/minor degrees in academia; they don't always consider them to be equivalent to European higher education as aren't focused on a single subject.  ..and I stand by degree education having no bearing on software development proficiency. I've hired bachelors' holders over PhDs because they had more practical experience and more of a portfolio to show.,2019-05-11T06:18:09.373,8023
14980,5654,0,Great answer and as a Comp Sci grad I fully agree ;-). Seriously though I think your point about avoiding using someone else's code because you don't grok what's really going on is a hugely important one. I see people using the hugely resource inefficient Electron framework so they don't have to learn to code for desktop whilst failing to understand the consequences of using an unwieldy web app framework to do something trivial in native code. See also the NPM left-pad debacle...did that really need to be a dependency? That's a first month Comp Sci lab assignment!..,2019-05-11T06:26:18.163,8023
14981,5629,0,First teach problem solving then programming then a language: So have them write programs for them to run on each other. Clear instructions to do something like make a jam sandwich or to draw a picture. Then teach them `snap` the a more useful language (the first one is about learning but they can transfer what they learn).,2019-05-11T11:36:00.443,204
14982,5627,0,If you don`t work for the cloud provider. Then do it in docker (that way it can be deployed on many platforms). Then at the end you can show them how to deploy (automate it they don't need the details yet and they can find out for themselves). If you do work for the cloud provider then you need lots of smoke and mirrors (to maximise wow-factor) and to use proprietary tools (to maximise vendor-lock-in).,2019-05-11T11:40:32.070,204
14983,5652,0,I read papers and technical documentation online. I don't see any value in paying uni to give links to the technical documentation. I didn't find my uni courses really useful. Even master courses.,2019-05-11T11:41:09.243,2054
14984,5653,0,Anecdotally my wife is an IB expert and I've seen some of the IB requirements for CS. It is leaps and bounds above AP in terms of rigor and expectations. I'll try to dig up some formal documents to flesh out a complete answer this weekend.,2019-05-11T15:24:41.187,76
14985,5654,3,Your point about focusing on having solid coding skills is very important. However your statements about software engineers is greatly overgeneralized. I've seen excellent developers from all types of computer/engineering backgrounds and I've seen terrible developers from all types of computer/engineering backgrounds. The difference between a software developer and computer scientist is really just semantics.,2019-05-11T16:02:06.160,8032
14986,5644,0,Agreeing to other comments: University doesn't make you a good coder. You'll have to do it yourself. If you've never had any interest in coding/tried it in your spare time University won't help. If all it takes for you to code in your spare time is a kick in the butt then come and get it. Do University when you can write simple software yourself .,2019-05-11T17:37:33.670,1100
14987,5658,0,Are you writing as a student or as the teacher?,2019-05-11T17:51:50.727,1293
14989,5645,1,_@Adrian but no I didn't say that software engineering is unrewarding. I said that a career as a _coder_ is unrewarding. I hope you aren't conflating the two. And there is another distinction. Managers decide what _will_ be built (or attempted). What _should_ be built is a larger question that has _ethical_ considerations as well as the economic ones that managers normally consider.,2019-05-11T18:17:42.173,1293
14991,5645,0,_@Adrian I doubt that Bill Cook is conflating the two in the same way you are. If you turned it around to A career in software engineering is a career in coding I might agree. If you hire me as a Software Engineer then I'm happy (and making $140K). If you hire me as a coder I suspect not. Yes software engineers do a lot of coding - as do some professors actually. But I'm not hired or paid as a coder.,2019-05-11T18:42:04.393,1293
14992,5658,0,I am writing as a student,2019-05-11T19:15:49.913,6894
14993,5653,0,I think that the APCS-AB curriculum was much stronger but they dropped part of it. Both programs seem to offer college credit (or at least skipping some courses) for good scores but I wonder how many colleges still really do that.,2019-05-11T19:57:18.243,1293
14994,5645,5,_@Adrian A software engineer doesn't have a career in coding any more than a motor mechanic has a career in screwdrivers. The career is whatever you're doing which needs coding to make it happen. Coding itself is simply a tool you use to carry out your work. And yes it is possible to create software without writing a line of code - LabVIEW and Matlab Simulink users do it all the time.,2019-05-11T21:13:59.710,1864
14999,5645,1,_@Adrian yes _entry level_ jobs are a lot about just coding. But if that is your only goal and you are still doing that in 10 years I think you could have - should have - aimed higher. Please read it again. I don't denigrate coding and I do a lot of coding (and consulting to large business on occasion) but simply suggest that coding isn't the goal.  We ivory tower professors usually try to encourage students to be their best and to aim high. Software Engineering is more than coding. Otherwise the course of study would only have about four subjects. Don't play word games please.,2019-05-12T12:02:12.447,1293
15000,5644,0,At my university software engineering and computer science students to essentially the same courses. SENG has stricter course requirements and the need to do internships and is 4 years instead of 3. However most people I've spoken too don't care what degree you have.,2019-05-12T12:25:34.203,681
15002,5653,0,_@Peter Thanks! I would appreciate that very much. My impression was that there was less significant coding in IB but if that is wrong I'd be glad to hear it.,2019-05-12T14:20:52.193,27
15003,5654,1,>I recommend that you study computer science as that will also teach you the basics of software engineering.<  There should be a large emphasis placed on basics here.. a lot of CS courses where theoretical foundations are seen as more important do not cover software engineering well.,2019-05-12T19:53:56.397,916
15004,5644,0,At my college Software Engineering was just one class (taught by John Guttag the co-designer of the CLU programming language) in the CS curriculum.,2019-05-12T20:16:57.500,1471
15005,5660,0,I've voted to close this because the for BS (CS) students part of the question seems incidental to the problem of _making a video tutorial_ and perhaps suited to another SE network site.,2019-05-12T20:24:19.343,916
15007,5645,0,Coding is always a way to achieve something not the goal in itself. But same way knowing your way around data structures algorithms business domains etc is also not a goal - it is a way to be able to code/design code better. As for the monetary part I beg to disagree - I have just recently received offer promising 150k GBP/year + bonuses (which tend to be considerable) + paid vacation/sick days/etc for mostly-coding position which I think is reasonable amount.,2019-05-13T09:29:11.590,4918

15010,628,0,It has to be a combination of both. You can ask students to write pseudo code on paper but please do not ask them to write compile-able code in a specific language on paper. If you want to test students' coding use automated solutions https://autogradr.com,2019-05-14T16:34:12.840,1397
15011,5664,1,So did you develop your tool in response to the problems you were having at the time you wrote this question?,2019-05-14T18:38:35.600,27
15012,5668,0,This seems like a local issue not a general one. It seems unusual to me as do the number of languages (too high). Perhaps you should ask this question of your faculty who designed the program.,2019-05-15T10:01:10.350,1293
15014,5668,1,First note: computer-science ???programming. Computer science is about much more than programming.,2019-05-15T12:07:58.307,204

15020,5668,0,I don't actually think it is a duplicate exactly but the answers to the other question probably apply to this one also. Perhaps with additional force.,2019-05-15T18:56:23.360,1293
15021,5664,0,Yup! I was a TA and built this project to solve this problem. Now we have a community of hundreds of professors using this solution to improve their course.,2019-05-15T19:08:09.967,1397
15022,5664,0,_@tusharoni Does the contact email on the website currently go to you? (And would you object if I contacted you?),2019-05-15T21:25:27.790,27
15023,5668,0,_@Buffy It might not be. Either way I'd love some clarification from OP.,2019-05-15T21:26:53.860,27

15035,5646,0,DLD does not prepare a student for electrical engineering. This does not entail the physical properties of electricity but only the ways in which logic can be used to achieved certain outcomes in certain conditions (which is commonly done using electricity but irrelevant to a programmer).,2019-05-17T12:35:25.290,2164

15039,5680,0,Yay she got 3rd place! :) Anyways I get what you are saying. The idea of being a disappointment hadn't crossed my mind but it fits the bill. I've never pressured her and whenever I see that she becomes unhappy I just stop and move on to something else. So I don't think I've got a vicious circle yet -- but I'll keep this in mind for the future. As for your suggestions - as I said she's already going to a group that has a good teacher and I don't think that we need a private tutor so basically I'll just stop trying to teach her unless she comes to me first. Thanks! :),2019-05-18T17:21:38.257,6155
15040,5680,0,I'll see if something else comes up and if it doesn't within a day or two I'll accept your answer.,2019-05-18T17:25:43.463,6155
15042,5680,0,It is good to wait for a while before accepting answers. Some people who want to answer will also want to reflect a bit before actually writing. But note also that you can withdraw and re-assign acceptance if it comes to that.,2019-05-18T19:43:30.223,1293
15043,5680,0,I know. But I also don't want to scare other people off who might not answer if the question already has an accepted answer. :),2019-05-18T21:45:35.957,6155
15044,5682,1,Actually it is useful to intentionally make a few mistakes when programming in front of a class. Back in the day a useful student exercise was to write a program that generated _every_ Fortran diagnostic. Another useful exercise was (and remains) giving students a program that had certain well designed errors (some syntactic others deeper) with instructions to repair the program. Such a program is called a _Fixer Upper_ in Pedagogical Patterns circles.,2019-05-19T13:23:48.860,1293
15045,5682,0,_@Buffy Is there somewhere a collection of exercises fitting this pattern? I find them maddeningly hard to design.,2019-05-19T15:53:20.277,27
15046,5682,0,Hmm... interesting ideas for my metaphorical toolbox. While I doubt they alone will solve my problem they are nonetheless very useful.,2019-05-19T17:16:47.340,6155
15047,5682,0,_@BenI. actually they aren't that hard to create. I've used them as a first exercise to give a quick overview of a language and a program in the language. Take any program that you are proud of and that has great structure. Make it a bit longer (twice) than you would ask them to write at that stage. Throw in a couple of logic errors and a few syntax errors. In Java make sure you have javadocced the intent of each part. Don't include basic structural errors at that point. Probably tell them how many errors it has. You want them to see a few compiler messages and you want them to get (cont),2019-05-19T18:55:06.567,1293
15048,5682,0,output that is not quite right. Off by one errors for example or even run time errors if not too complex to fix. With six errors and ten minutes expected per error you have an exercise. It is fine if one of the errors is a bit tricky but not all of them.,2019-05-19T18:56:47.167,1293
15052,5684,5,You still don't have enough information here to provide help. How old is your brother? What sort of difficulties is he having? Is he taking a course or just learning alone?,2019-05-19T21:48:33.953,1293
15053,5685,1,Did you read the question or just the title?,2019-05-19T21:52:26.407,6155
15054,5687,0,This question like some others lately is off topic here. The site is for teachers looking for better ways to teach.,2019-05-20T12:25:37.797,1293
15055,5687,0,paper+pencil+eraser is usually a good start before using any software to produce the final version. First decide what you want it to look like.,2019-05-20T13:15:21.300,2103
15056,5610,0,Nailed it with ...just an implementation detail. As a developer I could not care less about gates themselves (heck I probably couldn't even draw most of them without a reference at this point) however I do care a great deal about how I set up all of my conditional statements. I've even drawn out truth tables for some of the more complex stuff.,2019-05-20T20:33:21.650,6582
15057,5682,0,_@BenI. these kinds of problems can also come organically. I've often taken a student's *almost correct* answer to a question and used it in later assignments/quizzes/examples to see if others can spot (and explain) the error.,2019-05-20T21:33:54.560,6746

15060,5688,0,I've heard about these ideas before and I agree with them. I've even had a bit of a personal experience with this problem as well in my own youth. And I am trying to impart this wisdom to my daughter as well but I don't think it's going too well. She's still fairly afraid to make mistakes and gets discouraged by them. Are there any practical tips for making people more confident about making mistakes and putting effort into improving? I'm kind of at a loss here besides offering a lot of don't worry it's no biggie you'll do better next time kind of encouragement.,2019-05-21T08:42:37.733,6155

15062,5694,0,I like this answer because you not only suggest that a queue be used but also compare it with other solutions to the problem,2019-05-22T19:17:59.207,3036
15063,5690,0,Some of the answers here are good examples of the use of a queue but not all are easily amenable to problems that can be programmed early on.,2019-05-22T19:58:54.683,1293
15064,5607,0,This sounds like a real world application of the if they have eggs buy a dozen joke ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/827kuk/a_programmer_is_going_to_the_grocery_store/)).,2019-05-23T13:27:23.697,2164

15082,5709,0,That's all very well and nice but as far as programming itself is concerned I already have that knowledge. How can this book help me to teach my daughter in a way she feels comfortable with?,2019-05-25T16:51:17.117,6155

15094,5713,1,Hi! This answer might be good but you should expand on what you have written and perhaps give explanations and examples.,2019-05-26T16:02:54.480,150
15095,5710,0,Hi! What you say is true but it's unclear how this answers the question. If you include explanations relevant to teaching (for example: how one can use arduino to teach) it would greatly improve the answer.,2019-05-26T16:04:42.963,150
15101,5716,0,Welcome to [cseducators.se]! Your question sounds interesting. You could improve it by adding information about context. i.e. what class is it? high-school university etc. Also if you could mention what resources are at your disposal (is there a teacher computer in the classroom etc.) people could answer much more useful answers.,2019-05-28T05:46:02.417,150
15108,2718,0,you will get `NullPointerException` because that **pointer** points to null. You mean because that pointer does not point to anything. (Hence asking for a thing that it points to raises an exception.) As confirmed by the quote you put after that statement--a special null reference which refers to no object.,2019-05-30T05:08:26.697,2485
15110,5724,0,Hi and welcome to [cseducators.se]!  You've come to the right place.  Could you edit this question to include some possible goals?

15111,5728,0,Say something about scale. How many students? How many projects? Team based projects or no?,2019-05-30T19:07:04.383,1293
15112,5728,0,Not a whole lot 60 students max.  Although I'm inclined to teach writing code through project-based curriculum the specific amount will be based on what options I have available to me.  I feel the same way about team-based projects as well I'd like to include a lot of them but they can be very messy to assess if the right structure isn't available on my end.,2019-05-30T19:14:57.027,8104
15116,5730,0,Thank you for taking the time to go over an approach to tackle my problem.  I'll definitely take it into consideration when approaching the class.    However I'm looking for tools or techniques for grading automation.  I would really like to be able to learn from approaches that other instructors use to make a first pass at assessment of HTML CSS and JavaScript code for Web Development projects.,2019-05-30T23:18:31.377,8104
15117,5731,0,Thanks for the feedback it was exactly what I'm looking for.  Do you have a recommendation for a linter? As an aside I currently use GitHub Classroom for all of my programming courses and utilize diff frequently.,2019-05-30T23:28:11.530,8104
15118,2718,0,The value of pointer is usually zero (meaning null) in most implementations. That represents null value that indicates that the pointer does not refer to a valid object. That pointer is called Null pointer/reference or some people call it null object pointer. Function pointer is a pounter that points to a function. Data pointer is a pointer that points to some data. In a similar manner Null pointer is a pointer that points to null value. Maybe you don't use the same syntax/wording but semantic is the same and we think about the same thing.,2019-05-31T00:31:13.537,2054
15119,2718,0,Does not point to anything for you is the same as points to null value for me. I am not a native English speaker so I guess that formally you are correct. But it is important that people understand what I mean. I guess that I failed in that regard :(,2019-05-31T00:32:37.477,2054
15120,5731,0,Since I never got the automated linter habit I have no recommendations. A good place to start looking might be on [GitHub](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters). As an alternative you could consider asking a new question about how to evaluate/look for in a linter for classroom/grading use. Do mind the idea that shopping list questions [aren't received well](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/23/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/) on most SE sites.

15130,1363,0,Python does not actually store lists in a sequence of equally sized memory blocks or rather it does but those fixed-sized memory blocks don't store the items directly they merely store references to the objects representing the items.,2019-05-31T15:56:22.663,1287
15136,5731,0,I'm won't say you must unit test but I'd hate anyone to get the impression that validators and linters give you the same thing unit testing does. A unit test gives you an automated test that proves your code performs as you expected. It documents the abstraction you need. It makes promises about what it will do that using code can depend on. You can't buy that off the shelf. You have to write it yourself. Yes you can inspect what the page looks like but thats manual testing. There are [many JavaScript unit testing tools](https://www.guru99.com/javascript-unit-testing-frameworks.html).,2019-06-01T14:43:38.273,1401
15137,5731,0,_@candied_orange You cannot unit test HTML it's not executable code. If it renders as intended on the web page it's correct. Validating the DOM in the HTML is the only way to automate the testing of the HTML markup.,2019-06-01T18:04:11.960,104
15138,5731,0,_@GypsySpellweaver you're forgetting the JS that the op mentioned.,2019-06-01T19:27:15.610,1401
15139,5731,0,Since OP uses unit testing already I have to presume that they already have a preferred option for JS unit testing. The HTML seems to be their problem.,2019-06-01T20:01:41.740,104
15153,5742,0,If they count pedagogical research as research then it would be easy. Can you remember which SIGCSE member you're referring to?

15187,5755,1,I like the idea and I'm sure that there are lots of good choices coming from Hollywood. Unfortunately it's more of a poll or listing question and has no right answer. Therefore I'm suggesting that the question be closed. It's possible there may be some good discussion to be had in [The Classroom](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom) the sites dedicated chat room.,2019-06-11T06:47:07.723,104
15188,5754,0,I think it might. Thanks! :),2019-06-11T07:16:21.357,6155
15189,5753,1,Nice! I'll try to remember all this the next time when/if  get to teaching her. :),2019-06-11T07:22:27.250,6155
15190,5755,3,What age level? What educational level?,2019-06-11T10:26:38.950,1293
15191,126,1,_@pluke I don't have the book in front of me but the interwebs tell me it's Little Cat Z.,2019-06-11T12:13:15.167,65
15192,5757,3,I question the concept actually. Being able to write hello world in 25 different languages isn't really anything at all. You seem focused on programming rather than CS which is fine at the level given the time but programming is about creating abstractions of one form or another. In some languages it is only possible to create a very few kinds of abstraction (C - function abstraction). In other languages more is possible. But Java and Python while rich have about the same ability. And the difference at the abstraction level between C++ and Java is extremely subtle. Teach abstraction.,2019-06-12T12:03:48.360,1293
15193,5757,0,_@Buffy quite true. I should remove CS from the question. It's more a how to interest them in learning programming question... They are smart kids and inquisitive. Some will definitely want to learn CS in the future if I can get them interested in programming.,2019-06-12T12:06:06.603,150
15194,5757,0,If your scale is small (say 10 or fewer) you could just create an agile programming firm and build something fun in a language like Java or Python. You are the customer feeding into the product backlog. They do one day sprints. You get to set the difficulty of each task increasing them as the students learn more. They learn enough of the language to carry out the current task. They work together (pairing) teaching one another etc. If the day (sprint) ends at 15:00 you have time for retrospectives or even giving them goodies: interesting facts about CS or other languages or ...,2019-06-12T12:16:49.070,1293
15195,5757,0,As for the something fun part I've had some success with building a computerized version of some physical board game. Students have an obvious metaphor to guide what they are doing. And such a project can be treated as a success even if little is actually built.,2019-06-12T12:28:30.680,1293
15196,5757,0,Interest them in learning programming is a very vague outcome.  Perhaps a better outcome may be to have them able to encode some trivial algorithm in a programming language.  Even building simple sort algorithms is non-trivial when you get into questions of character sets etc.,2019-06-12T14:08:22.373,4689
15197,5757,2,By the way if you're going to show students OOP for God's sake don't show them C++ or Java!  Those two are among the _worst_ implementations of OOP that I can name.,2019-06-12T14:09:39.243,4689
15198,5757,0,_@OnorioCatenacci a strong opinion about Java. I have an equally strong but opposite opinion. It is quite a good vehicle if used correctly.,2019-06-12T17:13:07.760,1293
15200,5757,0,_@Buffy that's not exactly _my_ opinion of Java.   I feel confident in saying that probably Alan Kay (the gent who actually invented OOP) would agree with my statement. See [here](https://ivanovivan.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/alan-kay-quotes/) for more details but this is the money quote: *and actually I made up the term object-oriented and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.*  Java is in a lot of ways just C++ with manual memory management removed.  It's certainly not the message-passing late-binding that Kay envisioned.,2019-06-12T20:09:45.493,4689
15201,5757,1,_@OnorioCatenacci Yes I can believe Kay talking about C++ that way but note that Stroustrup doesn't take Smalltalk as a predecessor of C++ but Simula instead which predates Smalltalk and has a different model. You are misrepresenting Java rather badly. It does have a Smalltalk-like object model. It does have both message passing and late binding though not everything is an object. For primitive data it is like C (more or less). Perhaps you confuse late binding and static type checking. They are not the same.,2019-06-12T20:14:04.320,1293
15202,5757,0,Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/94825/discussion-between-onorio-catenacci-and-buffy).,2019-06-12T20:19:23.837,4689
15203,5682,0,I actually made a list of common student problem types and generate a test exercise each semester by taking some book sample code and rolling dice against my table to determine what errors to inject.,2019-06-13T03:01:21.063,8137
15204,5757,0,Have you seed this very important video? https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en,2019-06-13T08:46:03.727,204
15206,5757,2,Do you hate them?: C ?€? nice and small (lisp is smaller) but archaic low-level; Java ?€? to much boiler plate; Javascript ?€? to many dark corners and sharp edges; C++ ?€? how many years did you say you have; python ?€? acceptable until we find something better.,2019-06-13T08:53:27.170,204
15207,5759,0,Hm... I hadn't thought about Unity.,2019-06-13T09:57:53.797,150
15216,5760,1,Except for auto grading why do you need a special app? Having two windows (from different apps) open at the same time doesn't seem much worse than two panes of a single window. Do you have so many students that auto grading is a must have?,2019-06-14T11:27:21.993,1293
15217,5759,0,I think C#/Unity is a good place to start.  Another good place to start would be Scratch.  Yes it something that people usually think of as being only for very young folks but there's depth there and it could be a great learning exercise.,2019-06-14T13:53:20.717,4689
15218,5760,0,Have you explored the possibility of Jupyter Notebooks?  They support shell scripts using the `%%bash` header.,2019-06-14T14:08:28.233,8145
15219,5760,0,This is an opinion-based question I think but...one way of learning is to just provide SSH access with a user/password to each student on a Linux machine. This would allow them to explore the system more and to see real feedback. To demonstrate different commands you could simply devise bash scripts and plain text templates for students to copy and work on. The workbook can just be a text document. Keep it simple students will appreciate it (especially since in the real world you don't get fancy docs usually ;)),2019-06-14T20:40:55.013,8146
15220,5763,2,can we make this a wiki answer to build up the list?,2019-06-14T20:41:18.713,8146
15223,5763,2,Can we say something about each movie.,2019-06-16T13:35:33.243,204
15228,5641,0,Sorry for the late answer. Thanks for the interesting link! Pupils are usually between 8 and 11 years old. Groups can be heterogeneous (for example during activities in the public library) or homogeneous (students of the same class). In the former case it's not so easy to find exercises and themes that everyone can do without getting bored or having difficulties. I usually ask as one of the requirements the ability of doing simple multiplications but it may be not enough. Instead in classrooms we usually ask the teachers for some suggestions.,2019-06-17T08:51:49.467,8005
15229,5763,1,_@RudolfOlah fwiw community wiki is kind of mostly deprecated. (Yes I know that was an ungrammatical level of qualifiers.),2019-06-17T19:02:57.957,919
15230,5763,0,_@heather ah ok didn't realize that! thx!,2019-06-17T19:08:03.043,8146
15231,5763,0,_@RudolfOlah no problem =),2019-06-17T19:24:06.750,919
15232,5755,2,_@GypsySpellweaver - I'd like to make a counter argument. Ideas for teaching strategies can often be seen as a poll or listing - but that is the nature of teaching different classes and teachers will need different strategies to communicate the lesson. I think a collection of movies that address CS content along with commentary on what the content is and how to approach it seems appropriate and useful.,2019-06-17T20:04:53.917,134
15233,5763,0,If not the community wiki could we have one canonical post that accumulates the movies?,2019-06-17T20:22:41.313,134

15235,93,0,What is a BS? Are we talking about swear words here or *Bachelor of Science*? Or something else?,2019-06-18T09:29:34.913,1314
15239,93,0,_@PeterMortensen I was talking about Bachelor of Science. However looking at this question from 2017 I noted that these things are clear to me now and I know when to taech web development. Hope that this questions helps someone else with similar questions.,2019-06-18T17:56:36.310,116
15241,5772,0,Thanks for your input. There is some useful information. However I am not thinking of students with to GCSEs just no GCSE in computer-science. Also your actions are aimed at the A-level/university teacher not the KS3 teacher.,2019-06-19T07:18:50.400,204
15243,5772,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor - You are absolutely correct.  My main objectives are that the *undergrads* come out with either (a) a basic understanding which can later give them capacity to decide what is an ML problem and what is not or (b) an interest to pursue the topic further (and perhaps enroll in the advanced course later.  My experience with any student below undergrad level is far and in between (no more than a handful of hour with students preparing for A-levels on a voluntary basis).,2019-06-19T11:26:42.933,8156
15245,5772,0,_@BrianTompsett-????????? Fixed!  And thank you.  Somehow only the last one confused me so I didn't even notice the others.,2019-06-19T14:47:29.910,27

15250,5684,0,I think this could be a very interesting question but like Buffy said you haven't provided enough information for us to be able to help you. Also why is it imperative that your brother develop his interest? Why is it up to you?,2019-06-24T23:56:01.803,2068
15251,5763,0,It is OK to have lots of answers. I would expect a few for this type of question unfortunately it is incompatible with the ???interface but still the question is good and so the the answers. I will upvote good answers (not based on what films but based on explanations). I make my answer a wiki so as to encourage more suggestions.,2019-06-25T14:49:52.977,204
15252,5653,0,_@Peter Have you had a chance to look into this? It turns out that we will definitely be offering this course. I would absolutely love it if this question had an answer :),2019-06-25T23:33:32.420,27

15254,5697,0,Anyway properly indented code is always required from students (at least I hope so) even in free from languages so indenting is a part of the job in all cases. Python mandatory indentation avoids redundancy/inconsistence.,2019-06-27T12:52:18.833,2103
15255,5777,0,Keep it simple: intellisense and the equivalent in Eclipse push my students in the wrong direction a lot of their mistakes are because the tool told them to. e.g.It does not promote test-driven / test-first.,2019-06-27T14:51:17.100,204
15256,5784,0,Sorry but you seem to be asking how to set up an _educational_ program for only those who don't need it.,2019-06-29T09:47:04.517,1293
15257,5784,0,_@Buffy Sorry I should have been more clear. This program **already exists** and has been running for several years. I'm not asking how to set up the program I'm asking how to decide *who participates* if we switch to open enrollment instead of being invite-only which is what we've been doing so far.,2019-06-29T16:02:52.700,2068
15258,5785,0,Thanks for this reply you've given me a lot to think about. I should have been more clear in my question: this program **already exists** and has been running for several years. I'm happy to say that we already include a lot of what you mentioned (real-time communication a GitHub repo for each team etc). What we **don't** have yet is the form or pre-screening and/or qualification process you mentioned in your first paragraph. And we're talking about a couple *thousand* applicants not a few dozen. But a lot of what you said makes sense and I appreciate it.,2019-06-29T16:23:46.113,2068

15261,5787,2,What has been your experience when using pseudocode vs using code? -- this is going to get you a list of singular opinions. I recommend you ask for solid evidence instead e.g. in the form of scientific studies.,2019-05-16T21:19:51.253,842
15262,5787,2,You don't say what your _teaching goals_ are beyond the topic of the course. Those will heavily influence any didactic choice and may just make the difference here. The background and focus of your students is also relevant as is the form of exam you're going to hold. Say some students know Java others Python and some C++. How fair is an exam requiring Java skills? How do Java skills reflect on their data structure expertise?,2019-05-16T21:22:41.567,842
15265,5787,0,_@Raphael Since this question has been closed here may I recommend migration to [cseducators.se]?  It would certainly be welcome there.,2019-07-02T18:25:54.920,27
15266,5788,0,Something like you need to put an egg into the flour mixture isn't pseudocode. At best it's a rather vague user story in agile-speak. Pick up an egg is pseudo-code. The commands you send to your robot chef to achieve that objective is the *actual* code!,2019-05-17T11:51:22.827,1352
15267,5788,3,_@DavidRicherby Most people in an algorithms course intend to actually write code for a living. There is no reason to deprive them of experience converting problem descriptions to actual code. The skill of making that translation is *fundamental* to being able to do much of anything useful in computing.,2019-05-17T01:06:18.147,981
15274,5794,6,And perhaps even more importantly don't go about the entire course shoving **one** arbitrarily-chosen programming language down students' throats; specially not Java. That's very off-putting. I've seen complaints about this all too often.,2019-05-16T23:54:59.250,1206
15276,5794,3,Implementation from pseudo-code is one of the more long term useful skills. Outside an academic algorithm design course I have rarely needed to create an algorithm from scratch. I have often needed to look one up in various references and implement it in whatever language I'm currently using.,2019-05-19T03:46:45.863,6558
15277,5787,0,Do you have a standard textbook for the course? Generally I'd recommend following the path of the text; they've probably thought about the issues much longer than you have tested it provided resources in that form etc.,2019-07-03T15:48:55.077,8137
15279,1303,0,I get what you are trying to say in each sentence but the use of language in this post is so sloppy/fuzzy that it is the sort of writing/presentation that is why students get confused.,2019-07-03T21:51:48.907,2485
15282,5801,0,Thanks! My confusion was introduced by one of my professors during my undergraduate course. He was a mathematician working with computer science. Maybe this was the reason. I will correct it now thank you!,2019-07-05T00:57:45.033,8199
15283,5797,4,Pedantry FTW!  I've been doing computers for almost forty years (got my CS degree 34 years ago) and **never** heard them called vectors and matrices.  Of course I've **used them as** vectors and matrices when having to program mathematical functions like matrix manipulation.  In that case though I'd load the matrix into a 2D array.,2019-07-05T02:25:16.777,3132

15286,5797,1,Just to be a tad pedantic myself (and maybe give you another way to think about it)..  Doesn't a mathematician call a bunch of scribbled numbers with brackets around them a vector?  It's just a list of numbers--it cannot be added multiplied or operated upon without some external routines that are currently in your head.  Couldn't the same thing be said of an array?  It has the same properties of that thing you put on paper--a list of numbers with the potential to be operated upon.  You can totally add two vectors in a computer--just supply the subroutine.,2019-07-05T17:58:57.953,1399
15287,5797,0,Welcome to CS Educators Stack Exchange! I hope we see more of you.,2019-07-07T14:20:47.977,283
15288,5797,0,_vectors and matrices are mathematical entities that can be added multiplied and so on while arrays and multidimensional arrays can't_ while this may have some theoretical support the practice is entirely different with hugely popular libraries for sciences like [numpy bringing up arrays as  mathematical vectors](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Numpy_Arrays). If students come out of your class with this rigid definition they will be very confused.,2019-07-08T12:00:44.560,6794

15302,5806,0,Java is a dreadful teaching language (not the worse). It has many problems including keywords that have to be used before you can teach what they do ?€?`public static void main ?€?`?€? It also discourages object orientation ?€?`static ?€?main`?€?. I can't remember all of the other problem but there are many. I have been teaching a student one-to-one and I see many problems because of the language. The last problem was trying to teach interfaces (Java and OO meaning don't match).,2019-07-14T17:44:40.403,204
15303,5804,0,I like python turtle.,2019-07-14T17:45:33.247,204
15304,5806,0,Your opinion is not widely shared. Java is used in APCS and in many many beginning collegiate courses. Also see: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/4718/1293,2019-07-14T18:10:05.500,1293
15305,5806,0,I 100% agree. However I suspect that it is the answer to ?€?What language is popular in industry??€? or ?€?What language do our instructors know??€? and not ?€?What is the best teaching language??€?,2019-07-15T08:36:30.697,204

15316,5823,8,Do you have a citation for your Pascal factoid? I don't remember that one.,2019-07-19T00:17:56.793,1293
15320,5822,1,_@thesecretmaster: That's what Ben is saying. The OP is asking why you don't teach about argv and Ben's answer is argv is an array so it's better to focus on stdin first,2019-07-19T04:45:09.517,5450

15334,5693,0,I like that your examples are ones that students could relate to.,2019-07-19T19:56:57.327,283
15335,5825,3,_@BenI. I've found that some students learn the concept of functions before they grasp the idea of execution.  They can wade their way through the code and make sense of it in their head but they can't see that the computer wades through it also in real time.  I find the same people tend to assume that if they compile `if(x) f(); else g();` that the compiler figures out which of those two branches will be taken and only captures the instructions for that branch.  They get bothered if I construct examples where it's hard to know which branch will be taken (such as when there is input),2019-07-19T20:01:37.550,812
15336,5816,1,Honest answer: the best way to learn to implement an algorithm or data structure quickly is to make sure you can quickly pull up the Wikipedia page on each!  Or if you want to get straight to the punch google [stack exchange](https://xkcd.com/1185/) for it.  (be sure to read the alt text),2019-07-19T20:11:42.533,812
15341,5825,3,Fascinating!  Could you add that into your answer?  It would make the answer more valuable.,2019-07-19T21:19:29.283,27
15346,5823,0,good question @Buffy. It was something I was taught in '86 as having been the case but no longer was but I took that as truth without asking for proof.,2019-07-19T23:07:36.120,8237
15349,5816,0,_@CortAmmon Sir what do you mean by alt text? You mean the standard books?,2019-07-20T06:26:20.560,8233

15354,5824,0,Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/96423/discussion-on-answer-by-r-why-teach-c-using-scanf-without-talking-about-comman).,2019-07-20T12:31:46.787,58
15355,5820,1,(not a pedagogical answer) The 2nd program is easier to use by a naive user.,2019-07-20T15:24:02.940,204
15356,5822,0,I don't even thing that `args[0]` etc is that magical. You can give it any name you want in some languages (C C++ java ?€?). They don't even need to know that it is an array. And as you say when they start arrays they will already know ?? of it. This may be a good example of learn to read before you learn to write. (not the learn to read code before you learn to write code interpretation. I think both interpretation are correct.),2019-07-20T15:28:40.873,204
15357,5822,0,Having to process args in main as another thing forcing the C++ Java ?€? learner away from OO. Is there another way?,2019-07-20T15:33:19.353,204
15358,5823,0,Wasn't it something with some implementations like: the first reads on input return the command line unless a write is issued on output ?,2019-07-20T17:26:45.447,2103
15359,5823,1,Source of a Standard Pascal compiler here : https://sourceforge.net/projects/pascalp5/,2019-07-20T17:48:10.833,2103
15360,5824,2,Now that this question has pointed it out the same thing is obviously true in assembly language.  So many Q&As about reading string inputs into buffers and so much code clutter from printing prompts first.  (Although we'd still get lots of asm questions about converting strings to integers especially multi-digit strings.),2019-07-21T05:00:46.477,1654
15361,5821,0,You make an interesting point about validating input.  But I don't think falling back to prompting makes any sense for a simple toy program.  `if(argc < 4){ puts(USAGE); return 1;}` near the top of main.  Maybe with a specific message like too few args as well as the usage string.,2019-07-21T05:07:39.717,1654
15362,5821,0,When it comes to parsing each arg in turn handling errors is maybe more problematic (like a string where there should be an integer).  Prompting 1 at a time with scanf gives a different debugging experience.  One bad input can block the rest of the inputs if you don't do error checking and remove the bad token from stdin.  But a failed `atoi()` or `strtoul` just produces zero.  There's something interesting to be said there about the difference in how you validate input and report errors and the debugging experience for total beginners.,2019-07-21T05:12:56.207,1654
15363,5821,0,`atoi` is probably easier: a debugger can find that it's returning zero and/or that you're calling it on the wrong string.  But a debugger generally can't observe the stdin I/O buffer to find out why some combo of input + format string is making all the later `scanf` calls fail.  (Same applies to debug-printf statements for people that haven't yet learned to use a debugger.),2019-07-21T05:15:13.227,1654
15364,5824,0,_@PeterCordes: Absolutely. And it's even worse if you don't have subroutines yet and rather misleading if you use bios/syscalls in place of subroutines. I'd hesitate to each asm as a standalone language at all preferring to teach it first with call from C being the way it's invoked.,2019-07-21T06:06:16.827,1327
15365,5824,0,The MARS  MIPS simulator keeps things somewhat clean by providing syscall implementations of read integer from user-input and of print decimal print hex etc.  It's very much a toy system. I think it makes command-line args accessible to modify between runs somehow though.    For x86 Linux running natively not in a toy simulator probably teaching calling conventions as part of the boilerplate for running asm by calling from C would work. But it does introduce more moving parts. I can certainly see why courses don't do that at least if they try to do asm before student's really grasp C.,2019-07-21T06:46:13.810,1654

15393,5826,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor it doesn't relate to divide and conquer I don't think - seems like OP is saying 'just like we use this real world example for this thing what real world example can we use for divide and conquer?' I also can't really comment on the quality of the boomerang analogy; I was just trying to guess as to what the OP meant =),2019-08-01T01:33:45.357,919
15394,5840,0,Your first question is certainly topical so no worries on that front. I'm willing to bet that there has been all of zero research addressing this question so it will be interesting to see what people come up with.,2019-08-01T16:16:06.470,27
15395,5840,1,I'm less sure about the second question. Also could you do me a favor? Could you remove the second part and put it in its own question? There should only be one question per question in general and the two parts you've written are really quite distinct.,2019-08-01T16:17:13.403,27
15396,5840,0,_@BenI. There might not be any serious research relating to the CS field. There is however some research done on note taking for English classes. [Kiel Jacobs 2008](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ti5HzlCMHleDnFsiU4fgPhWuYxFxjH_/view?usp=sharing),2019-08-01T19:43:32.467,104
15397,5842,2,Welcome to CSE Stack Exchange. Great first answer!,2019-08-03T22:51:48.703,283
15398,5847,1,Yes a Bag is a good choice but frequencyOf  is probably inessential to the concept. Also there is no reason that Bag couldn't be a base class of other collection ADTs.,2019-08-05T11:44:19.577,1293
15399,5846,0,I don't think there exists a standard type that matches that description but there is no reason you can't follow your plan anyway with a customized name.,2019-08-05T12:38:15.340,27
15400,5846,0,I'd be curious to hear why you're looking this ADT. How are you planning on using it in your class?,2019-08-05T13:11:16.830,58
15401,5846,0,i will use it because we will be implementing it many different ways: with list ordered list tree dictionary. It is just a small callback to the fact that we have many solutions to the same problem and also a way to drill the concept of ADT,2019-08-05T13:35:45.283,4251
15402,5846,2,The set ADT unfortunately supports more operations gives Wikipedia a lot of credence. I'm not confident that there is a canonical definition of *THE* set ADT. Yes there are other things you can typically do with sets but you don't have to introduce those operations.,2019-08-05T13:48:52.287,8309
15403,5846,1,Yes I am beginning to think (see bag bellow) that these ADTs have many definitions and I can just call it set or bag and define it as I please,2019-08-05T13:51:27.033,4251
15404,5845,0,Thanks for the detailed answer : I've never asked for a takeaway solution ( in the ideal world this could be language agnostic ^^ ) I find it strange that there is nothing even for the most used languages (Python Java C etc.),2019-08-05T13:57:30.687,8306
15405,5846,2,A set by definition cannot contain multiple copies of the same item. A multiset or a bag (at least in my intuition) can. Can your data structures? That is an important difference that can confuse your students.,2019-08-05T14:52:34.080,1658
15406,5846,0,Of course it depends on how you define insert and remove whether there is any difference between a set and a bag. In fact a set can probably be built from a bag just by reimplementing remove. The question is what happens if you execute isContained after remove. And an interesting implementation of a bag is as a hash map where the values inserted are the keys mapped to positive ints.,2019-08-05T20:29:30.307,1293
15407,5664,0,On similar lines to HackerRank there's SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge): on a quick look I don't see that they make their backend software available but maybe if you ask.

15410,5830,0,Your two pieces of pseudocode for solving a particular problem are an excellent example of how easy and instructive it is to compare algorithms. One requires half of n squared comparisons the other 2 n comparisons in a linear scan of the array. Very nice.,2019-08-07T23:34:14.920,5349

15414,5760,0,The Unix shell is rather limited as it is more a vehicle for calling complex programs and combining snippets.

15423,5830,0,If I understand you - it is still early in the day - Anyone who sees loop over all pairs and does not immediately see a nested For loop (or equivalent) has never written a program. I didn't even think for one second about it as I read the pseudocode and I saw that we only have to do the upper triangle because there is no point in both comparing x to y and also comparing y to x. But seeing that we only need to capture the max and min as we scan once was pleasant. This is why I find SQL so fascinating. Data is really amazing stuff. I despair of teaching these nuances.,2019-08-10T13:11:48.673,5349
15424,5859,0,Nice. I just think that we have gotten carried away with the whole idea of paradigms approaches methods concepts and what-all. It is over-investment in ideas. I first sat down at a teletype 40 years ago and learned several languages as wildly different as Basic and APL within a few years. As I wrote programs and some of them got used in my workplace I developed approaches for different areas that worked for me. Some of it was pretty 'Functional'. Some was 'Object Oriented'. Some was definitely event-driven. DSLs are my favorite. I did what made sense. So I am bemused by the *Paradigms*.,2019-08-10T13:20:07.597,5349
15425,5860,0,Hi Mouley welcome to [cseducators.se]. I have a feeling that this is a bit out of our scope -- we generally take questions about how to teach CS rather than questions about being a student.

15435,5863,0,All fair statements. I still wonder why someone would after attending free compulsory schooling for a decade sign up to pay for more when they do not know what they want from it? Schooling does not tell you what you want. So my root question is not so much about going after what you want as about knowing what that is to begin with. Perhaps I should rewrite it... How can someone not know what they want enjoy what interests them? Something must or they would not get out of bed in the morning.,2019-08-11T12:04:26.413,5349

15450,5866,2,It depends on how familiar you are with the abbreviation. In England we use lab all the time so much so that some may not know the long version.

15452,5871,0,Once you understand the fundamentals of programming languages the differences at the beginning level is just syntax.  Once a kid can program in something as simple as Scratch (although some pretty complicated programs have been don in Scratch) learning a new language starts with the new syntax.  When I am doing Python Java and Small Basic it is often Opps wrong For loop syntax.  Language is not just syntax but often the differences between languages is syntax.,2019-08-20T18:20:43.250,2476
15453,5871,0,Sorry but you are demonstrating ignorance here. A good python program should not look like a VB program. It requires a different mindset. Do you think that the difference between say Scheme and Scratch is just syntax?,2019-08-20T18:43:39.563,1293
15455,5876,0,That sounds fair thanks to you both Buffy and Ben! :) I realise that what I'm asking is not trivial and may even be impossible. But I would be happy with something that can give me good guesses.  Also I aware of the halting problem but am not convinced it is an issue for the relatively small programs we have here. Note that I can already recognise looping programs as they do not pass the functional tests and that even something that simply counts loops and thus over estimates could provide a nice starting point.,2019-08-21T12:36:55.677,8184
15456,5876,0,Probably not possible. It would likely both over and under estimate in some (different) cases. BTW I once implemented an exponential time algorithm in production code because the size of the measured quantity could only be small enough to be irrelevant. Some people thought that was crazy but it worked.,2019-08-21T12:39:22.923,1293
15457,5875,4,[Rice's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem) states that any non trivial semantic property is undecidable. A trivial property is a property that either holds for all programs or for none of them. A semantic property is a property of the behaviour of the program not the input-output. The property does the algorithm take O(n^2) time? is thus a non-trivial semantic property and it follows that it is undecidable **in general** and no such tool can exist.,2019-08-21T18:24:04.983,8343

15461,5878,2,Welcome to [cseducators.se] I suspect that such a resource doesn't exist. Educational materials tend to go the easy way and use the IDE so that the students can focus on the language not the workflow. Developing a CLI workflow is probably more of a personal preference than a standard to disseminate.,2019-08-24T20:58:29.797,104

15466,5880,0,Well updating the tree is already implemented I'm looking more for ways to practice the usage of a tree. Same goes for tree traversal in modern languages you traverse a tree with the same piece of code as traversing a list.,2019-08-26T19:10:22.503,8356

15468,5882,0,Even though Greenfoot uses the BlueJ editor it has never had a New Interface... menu item. You must create a new class and change the class to interface as Buffy says.  I have tested this with all versions from 3.04 thru 3.6.,2019-08-26T20:40:40.947,3840
15469,5882,0,You can also create an interface (or other) with an external editor and import it from that same menu. There is actually a way to use Eclipse as an external editor for greenfoot if you don't like the built in one. Edit in eclipse and run in greenfoot. Once set up it is pretty straightforward.,2019-08-26T21:02:22.303,1293
15470,5883,0,Thanks for all of the detail! It sounds like Greenfoot isn't really designed to show Interfaces specifically which was what I was beginning to suspect.  How much starter code do you provide for GoL?,2019-08-27T00:52:45.730,27
15471,5883,0,There is actually very little required.  The most difficult aspect is managing the state transition because all cells have to change simultaneously. So I show that piece in class.  When we move the solution to a MVC pattern (the universe has a separate model to maintain the state) I provide array copying methods. A large part of the lab is working within the iterative incremental build cycle. The core algorithm is provided by the wiki site.,2019-08-27T01:11:45.740,3840
15472,5883,0,As a side note: comparing the execution speed and profiles between the two implementations is my lead in to Big-O and algorithm efficiency (space and time).

15474,4230,0,Forgive me but you should check out modern C++ it has proved over and over again to be the best first language and unlike many misunderstandings it is not an object-oriented language only to explain why let's say that modern cplusplus does not use pointers anymore which is the greatest complaints about teaching C for beginners yet it keeps the understanding of how the machine works there are many papers published about the advantage of using C plus plus as a first language,2019-08-27T06:19:11.987,3417
15476,4230,0,_@Elkady I'm not sure if you're making a joke. Pointers have not been removed from modern C++. No one thinks C++ is object oriented. In a beginners course there should be negligible differences between C and C++.,2019-08-27T18:37:09.900,4082

15498,5881,0,Interfaces are just a kludge in the java language to allow polymorphism in the absence of multiple inheritance (The developers of Java did not know how to safely implement repeated inheritance so eliminated multiple inheritance).,2019-09-05T21:43:10.350,204
15499,5881,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor I can't say as I agree with you there. Interfaces are more powerful than that and used in plenty of places where any sort of inheritance would be inappropriate such as iterators or compareto.,2019-09-05T22:05:38.477,27
15500,5895,0,Oh! Thanks for pointing that out I should talk to my university about this then as this is what they recommend I put on it ;(  So am I right in understanding that this is okay for slides etc but not for the implementation assignments? Or not even that?,2019-09-06T07:00:46.203,8184
15503,5881,0,To make a class an iterator (or anything else): class A is an iterator. Is an example of polymorphism. (so **exactly** as **un**-powerful as I stated). And full inheritance is totally appropriate. It is just banned in Java and can be dangerous in C++ (but only if repeated (not just multiple) inheritance). There are languages that make even repeated inheritance safe.,2019-09-07T21:23:31.763,204
15504,5881,1,_@ctrl-alt-delor I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree here.  Interfaces are lightweight versatile and allow the compiler to do important work for you. Using inheritance to make your iterators seems like an odd idea.  My n-ary tree my 3-dimensional jagged array and my spanning tree should implement Iterator completely differently.  The only thing that my foreach loop needs to know is that they can iterate.  I'm not aware of any language that is statically typed but does not support interfaces (or abstract classes which gets you the same thing).,2019-09-08T02:29:17.510,27
15505,5881,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Even Python added a module for abstract classes and it's dynamically typed so there is nominally no need for it.,2019-09-08T02:34:14.140,27
15506,5881,0,Yes it seem like an odd idea because java invented an inferior way. However I am not discussing a language that does not support interfaces (no a inferior thing). I am saying that one does not need an interface keyword (with limited functionality to implement interfaces). One should be able to use classes to create: interfaces (you can do this in java but can only inherit one); interfaces with pre/post/invariant conditions; interfaces with some functionality. And to have multiple inheritance e.g. A inherits B and comparable and ...,2019-09-08T19:57:27.713,204
15507,5881,0,Comparable should be allowed to implement `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `==` and `!=`. with out having to write a tonne of code. One should just have to write say `<` for each implementation. In addition the compiler should do important work for you (optimisation) you should not have to use special devices (`interface`) to get the compiler to optimise. A pure abstract class should be as light as an interface would have been. Classes that are not used polymorphic should be called statically (optimisation). Inheritance chains and call chains should be flattened where possible.,2019-09-08T20:03:07.540,204
15508,5881,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor Of course Java does this now.  Since Java 8(?) you can put default code in interfaces and that code will be inherited.  As to `<` `<=` etc you can easily extend an interface with another broader interface to accomplish both `Comparable` and `FullyComparable`.  I'm honestly not that sourfaced about lacking operator overloads.  They can be nice but they're just syntactic sugar and they can also be abused to make code less clear.  Don't get me wrong I'd like to have them available but it's not something I get too fussed about.,2019-09-08T21:08:19.667,27
15509,5900,0,Would you mind providing a bit more explanation for why you think merge sort is a good example to use for teaching divide and conquer?

15513,5903,0,I'm a third year computer science student. I understand the concepts that are being explained in the book but I find that without a lecture or some sort of secondary material I struggle with retaining the information and applying it to my work. I would like to find some sort of online course that follows the book to make up for the lack of instruction I'm receiving.,2019-09-11T20:02:30.777,8405

15515,5903,0,The course consists of lecture session homework assignments and tests.

15517,5905,1,The series covers topics in a similar order to the book. There is no assumption of what you do or don't know material is covered from the ground up. Each video provides multiple examples of problems. It's what I was looking for when I initially asked the question.,2019-09-13T01:56:34.657,8405

15519,5907,0,The first sentence of your second paragraph is spot-on. In most cases I suspect that those constructs were just forgotten... Also i don't see why functions/methods are taught that late but that's almost another topic...   Also I'm not really sure if there is a clear plan behind this or if it is more about authority than didactics or in other words: Rules are rules and that's it! Just follow them and don't ask why they have been set up. If you don't follow them you disrespected the teacher and will be penalized!,2019-09-13T20:36:09.143,8354
15520,5881,0,the operator over loading was just an example. I will look at what you say about interfaces being allowed default code (sounds like classes).,2019-09-13T22:15:29.083,204
15521,5909,1,Even though I completely see your point my point which was maybe not made clear enough in my question is why students are forced to do typical don't try this at home-programming because of those restrictions. Also mostly I don't have the feeling that the teachers are following a clear didactic plan which requires to solve specific examples with specific constructs but it's more about their authority which is undermined if their students leave their path and start learning on their own(and also that some constructs are just forgotten but that's another topic).,2019-09-13T23:38:21.363,8354
15522,5909,0,Getting students used to obeying arbitrary authority is its own benefit they are likely going to need to do so much of their working life even if they aren't working as programmers. The worst example of this I encountered as a student was an instructor who flat forbade use of the C -> operator even after it was encountered in the book. He insisted that (*ptr).member constructs be used instead. That one I never have figured out other than it being an ego trip.,2019-09-14T04:58:36.093,8415

15527,5906,9,Sometimes I think it's just bad pedagogy.  I'm reminded of [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56851693) where the restriction seemed particularly pointless and counterproductive.  (It might have made sense for the *instructor* to demonstrate the solution without an array to then motivate the use of arrays.  But to require the student to write the code without using an array seemed to me anyway pedagogically insane.),2019-09-14T16:38:18.637,8420

15530,5908,0,_@AndreaLazzarotto the simple prohibition _without reasoning_ is what doesn't make sense to them. You have to motivate the requirement to avoid the reaction this is stupid.,2019-09-14T22:16:54.073,1293
15531,5908,1,The reasoning is obvious. If there exist libraries or more convenient methods to solve a problem depriving it from educational value the instructor needs to forbid such methods. Any university student is able to understand this.,2019-09-14T22:28:16.327,963
15532,5912,1,Well yes of course they should understand what they are doing. But who says that they understand the code if they copy code that just uses techniques and language constructs that are covered by the lessons? And on the other hand if students know what they are doing why would you prohibit the use of anything not covered by the lessons? Of course in specific cases you want the students to solve it in a specific way and everybody will understand this but that's no general rule.,2019-09-15T04:26:10.223,8354
15533,5908,0,_@AndreaLazzarotto The reason might be obvious in specific cases but not as a general rule. If you have this as a general rule the only explanation I have for this is the rule that stands above all others: obey the authority!,2019-09-15T04:30:01.743,8354
15534,5912,1,_@csabinho Well at least they would have to study the code long enough to determine whether it used appropriate techniques.,2019-09-15T06:22:42.473,2492

15536,5906,5,Semi-related: requiring recursion for problems that are easier without it is quite common (often Fibonacci where naive recursive is just egregiously bad for performance).  If the concept isn't introduced *too* early there are problems where recursion is by far the easiest solution.   [What are good examples that actually motivate the study of recursion?](//cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/4143)  e.g. tree traversal Ackermann function or Merge Sort.  All of these avoid solutions that look recursive but actually keep global state like a loop (especially in asm with state in regs).,2019-09-15T19:58:34.623,1654
15537,5906,1,Well Fibonacci is still a quite OK problem for recursion I've seen lot worse examples for recursion.,2019-09-15T20:38:45.320,8354
15539,5909,7,_@SoronelHaetir Getting students used to obeying arbitrary authority is its own benefit Where I went to school my maths/latin/philosophy teacher who started at the school fresh from university when I entered school and was headmaster by the time I left prided himself in teaching the students two important abilities: To determine whether authority is right or wrong and to fight authority when it is wrong.,2019-09-15T22:48:24.587,4529
15540,5906,1,_@PeterCordes - it should be pointed out that recursive merge sort is mostly used for educational purposes. Most libraries use some variation of non-recursive merge sort for a stable sort. It becomes more clear in a when it is realized that a typical recursive merge sort is just generating and storing indexes on the stack and that no merging takes place until two instances of the base case (sub-run size == 1) occur while iterative bottom up merge sort skips all that recursion and treats an array of n elements as n base cases of run size == 1 and immediately starts merging pairs of runs.,2019-09-16T05:55:41.400,8428
15541,4144,1,Permutations may be tricky to do iteratively but a common iterative approach for next permutation involves using an array not anything that resembles a stack.,2019-09-16T06:30:31.177,8428
15542,5906,2,_@PeterCordes taken to extremes (as it is by e.g. the University of Cambridge) you can start by teaching programming in a functional language which doesn't have any way of looping *except* recursion. The counterpoint to *too early* would be that many iterative programs are implementing algorithms which are usually described recursively.,2019-09-16T07:36:53.150,1219
15543,5915,2,I'm quite sure that you are talking about a completely different scenario than I am! I am talking about prohibiting everything that has not been taught and of course on the other hand allowing everything that has been taught.You are talking about specific rules! Explicitly prohibiting certain things for certain tasks makes a lot of sense of course! Prohibiting everything and always makes no sense at all!,2019-09-16T08:56:59.697,8354
15544,5915,2,And I am talking about language constructs like switch and foreach. Those are rarely taught in the schools which I have to deal with and would be really useful.,2019-09-16T09:08:43.320,8354
15545,5914,1,This question is missing too many details to answer well. What do you mean by games?  What are you actually trying to teach them?  Is there a language or a set of concepts that you have in mind?  Are you at the program design stage or are you running a single course?  How much time do you expect you will have with the students and what is their background?,2019-09-16T12:13:02.097,27
15546,5907,0,_@csabinho Both are definitely true. Usually it's pretty easy to see - what was the latest thing the teacher has worked with? If they don't keep up with any new methodologies and technologies they probably prohibit things just to avoid having to learn anything new. If they do learn new things (and teach them when appropriate) they probably have didactic reasons for the prohibitions - and shouldn't have any problem explaining why a particular approach is forbidden. I've met plenty of teachers of both kinds.,2019-09-16T12:52:44.993,1816
15547,5917,0,A foreach-loop does something else than a for-loop and you can't change the array within a foreach-loop at least not without using it like a while-loop and have your own counter which is incremented in the loop body!,2019-09-16T13:56:46.390,8354
15548,5906,0,_@PeterTaylor: Sure.  I follow assembly-language tags on SO and my comment was 100% about imperative languages (and especially asm).  Recursion is non-trivial to implement in asm (no compiler to save/restore locals for you across function calls).  But Fibonacci makes a particularly bad example for asm recursion because it doesn't force you to distinguish passing/returning vs. just keeping a sum in a register that's effectively global for a beginner just trying to make something work.  Nonetheless questions about asm recursive Fibonacci homework are more common than any interesting recursion.,2019-09-16T15:05:56.630,1654
15549,5915,0,I am thinking of for example an restricted assembler dialect to teach how to work with its instructions. Or when you're thinking of foreach maybe how to implement a loop using comparision and jump instructions. I do not know lectures that really forbid foreach directly but in the context of e.g. an didactic assembler dialect I see a point in for example not allowing a multiplication instruction so the students need to implement it themself.,2019-09-16T18:06:46.967,4631
15550,5915,0,_@csabinho - it doesn't really matter what the restrictions are it matters that *dealing with restrictions* is a fact of life in programming.  Because you are not attending the course yourself you may not be familiar with them as ground rules and so constantly trip over them while proposing things you consider ordinary.  But the thought process of being able to work within *any* set of restrictions is key:  **never trust someone who can only solve a problem in a single way** . Many areas within CS require drastic changes of thinking to adopt and changing thinking is an important exercise.,2019-09-16T20:36:52.767,1308
15551,5915,0,_@ChrisStratton I'm talking mostly about beginners and restricting them to use anything that wasn't learned during the lessons stops them from being autodidacts which is also an absolutely essential skill in programming life. Those restrictions often reach the point you are talking about: being only able to solve the problem in a specific way and also as mentioned above it kills the drive to learn something new and teaches to stay on the given path and don't look to the left and right and don't strive to learn more and be ahead of what's taught if you don't want to get punished!,2019-09-16T20:55:16.030,8354
15554,5915,0,What you are not understanding is that the point of being forced to solve the problem in a specific way *at a given point in a course* is to **make sure you can really use that way**.  Then you move on and solve it in a different way.  If the choice is always free *students merely stick with their preferred familiar way* and never have to learn about the alternatives. There's also the distinct skill of learning to think in terms of the offered tools. The problem here is that **you are trying to re-write the actual instructor's syllabus** - when you aren't even a participant in the course(!),2019-09-16T22:05:07.833,1308
15555,5906,0,_@PeterCordes actually recursion is very easy to implement in assembly language.,2019-09-16T22:08:10.483,1308
15557,5906,0,_@ChrisStratton: Yes if you *know* assembly language then most things are easy. But the people that have trouble with it and post questions on SO often have other major holes in their understanding e.g. of registers vs. memory and what instructions do. On a typical register machine (like x86) it's certainly more complicated than in C because you have to save/restore regists manually. And it might be the first non-leaf function students have written if they're using MARS to learn MIPS where toy system calls do string or integer console I/O. RISCs use a link reg instead of pushing a ret addr.,2019-09-16T22:19:59.223,1654
15558,5906,0,_@PeterCordes - all of the machines you mention have stacks.  They may have certain optimizations like the LR but they all have stacks.,2019-09-16T22:37:23.047,1308
15560,5906,0,_@ChrisStratton: Yes but you have to use the stack manually.  Nothing writes those push/pop and stack-pointer adjusting instructions for you.  vs. higher level languages where you can do `int tmp = func(n-1);` and earlier local variables keep their values automatically.  I think you're missing the point about *teaching* assembly language to people that start out with zero understanding of it.  Of course everything is easy if you know how to do it but it does require using multiple instructions in the right order and thinking about / knowing more stuff than in a higher level language.,2019-09-16T22:49:39.883,1654
15561,5906,0,_@ChrisStratton: also if you want to nit-pick architecturally MIPS *doesn't* have a call stack.  It's easy to implement one in software if you choose to using its only addressing mode (`reg + imm16`) but not even HW interrupts use any register as a stack implicitly.  Of course the standard software conventions on MIPS do define a register as the stack pointer so if you're including that as part of MIPS then yes it has a stack.  Anyway saving/restoring a link register correctly is an extra complication that creates more ways to have infinite loop bugs for beginners. (Look at SO's MIPS tag),2019-09-16T22:55:23.270,1654
15564,5909,2,Ironically arbitrariness is not necessarily a bad thing as a learning exercise.  There's actual value to making up a language or computation machine with *absurd* and unfamiliar rules and learning to work within those as it teaches precisely the kind of plasticity of thought needing to find the best solution to real problems - especially those problems where conventional techniques fail or where past decisions (which may have been unwise but now are set) constrain current options in a way that rules out the usual solutions.,2019-09-16T23:29:35.517,1308
15566,5906,0,_@PeterCordes all of that and not a word about branch delay slots?  I'm disappointed :-)  More seriously most of what you mention is a challenge fundamental to assembly on these platforms *at all* - recursion isn't notably harder than more conventional function calls.,2019-09-16T23:42:43.383,1308
15567,5906,0,_@ChrisStratton: Agreed!  But before doing recursion some students have only written trivial leaf functions that can get away with clobbering any/all registers.  So at least some students don't really understand the basics of functions yet and/or recursion is teaching that too.  (And BTW MARS defaults to simulating a MIPS without branch delay slots.  Instructors using MARS/SPIM to teach intro-to-assembly use that variant of MIPS along with the toy I/O system calls instead of non-existent libc function calls.) Selection bias: only the most confused/lost or lazy post on SO about such basics.,2019-09-17T00:28:44.193,1654
15568,5914,0,I am trying to teach programming to them by regular program or by game. I did not choose program yet. yesI will gave it as a single course.For the time maybe 4 month.thanks,2019-09-17T01:33:12.220,8429
15569,4230,0,_@Gorchestopher H I will say again then that you should check out modern C++. I did not say pointers were removed I said they are no longer used. C++ is a general language and thus it keeps all the options including C-like syntax but it provides modern ways for programming. For example you under normal circumstances how would you justify using C-stings instead of modern string class? or still building & using using linked-lists instead of a vector (which by the way if far more efficient) ...etc.   Modern C++ code look a good deal like Javascript or even Java code. No pointers whatsoever.,2019-09-17T01:56:54.263,3417
15570,4230,0,to clarify: when I say normal circumstances I refer to a problem that you  can code without pointers whichever other high-level language you choose yet you would use pointers in C++. this no longer exist.,2019-09-17T02:05:52.560,3417
15571,5914,0,Teach by game meaning have the kids compete with each other across the semester for points? Or have them code games (something like Unity)? Or have them play a game like Human Resource Machine?,2019-09-17T12:34:53.620,27
15572,5919,1,This is a question about the site and as such belongs on [meta](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/). That aside the site is about _doing_ the education in CS not _getting_ the education is CS. Tagging to facilitate that kind of searching wouldn't really help the goal of the site. Doing such a search could be done using [resource-request] and/or [resource-information] along with the appropriate language/subject tag. I'd expect the results to be quite sparse however.,2019-09-17T15:43:29.100,104
15573,5919,1,_@GypsySpellweaver I think OP is asking about cataloged *programming exercises*.  I think it's a [tag:resource-request].  Perhaps OP could chime in?,2019-09-17T18:54:24.783,27
15574,5917,0,On the other hand the foreach loop may be easier to understand if introduced first simply because those questions can be deferred until later. I'm not suggesting that the questions aren't important; they may just be inappropriate *right now.*,2019-09-17T19:41:33.247,6704
15575,5825,0,As a teacher: mind blown. If your anecdote is correct there must be some subset of students who don't grasp the concept that the code for both branches are in the executable but one of them gets skipped over at runtime. Very interesting!,2019-09-17T20:07:16.150,6704
15576,5920,1,Why would an instructor want to level the playing field. Is learning a competitive sport like foot ball? I would certainly never do it for that reason. More advanced knowledge is a good thing. Again an exercise is seldom about getting an answer but about learning something important.,2019-09-17T20:23:22.797,1293

15582,5914,0,Hi Jared- you might find the guidance on how to ask a question useful in constructing a question that is more informative?  It would help to know what non-CS area the course is targeted at- perhaps there is a field that could be identified where coding would add some value?  How many hours/week?  Think about an objective for the class.  Will there be college credits or is this more for fun? Thanks.  https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask,2019-09-17T22:30:36.943,2706

15585,5880,0,I don't understand why you're talking about tree data structures but mention std::set and std::map. These might work with tree data structures *in the background* but they don't actually model trees they model sets and (keyvalue) pairs. So: Are you interested in using tree structures or learning how sets and (keyvalue) associative containers work?,2019-09-18T14:15:15.743,1336
15587,5922,0,Certainly you _can_ do that. But a deeper question is whether you actually _should_ teach students to program first with static methods. My experience is that it makes it more difficult for them to ever really understand the essence of an OO language like Java and how to use it. See for example: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/a/2883/1293,2019-09-19T00:06:06.797,1293

I used the term attempt not solution,2019-09-19T10:35:09.753,8306
15590,5922,0,I am of course a strong advocate of starting with objects and leaving lower level things for later. But you can't do it naively and just follow the language. Here are some ideas about resources for doing it well: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/4025/1293. The big idea is how do you move effectively from a _problem_ to a solution. Matching the _parts_ implied in the program to the objects that represent them. Few problems in the real world are naturally expressed in terms of ints. More can be naturally represented as objects.,2019-09-19T12:30:00.983,1293
15591,5880,0,_@Pascal I modified the question. I am interested in using tree data structures. I want to practice my skill at spotting what data structure fits to solve the problem effectively.,2019-09-19T15:32:06.230,8356
15592,5926,1,This would be good answer if the OP's goal was to teach C++ but the OP is teaching data structures. On most days a modern professional C++ programmer has no business messing with data structures. The C++ programmer should be using structures provided by the C++ standard library or by other common libraries. Programmers who roll their own most likely are wasting their employer's time and money... Unless they are employed to _implement_ common C++ support libraries.  And in _that_ case they probably had better know how to work with raw pointers.,2019-09-20T17:24:26.220,1269
15593,5926,0,_@SolomonSlow the course seems more basic than you suggest. data types control flows etc don't get taught in a proper data structures course.,2019-09-20T17:32:27.373,1293
15594,5925,1,You won't be able to properly implement circularly-linked lists using smart pointers. They aren't smart enough for that. You'll either have to use a language with garbage collection or you'll have to use raw pointers and explicitly `delete` whatever needs to be returned to the heap.,2019-09-20T17:49:33.797,1269
15595,5926,0,Hmm. Good point. Although OP also says circularly-linked lists which is kind of an advanced topic for programming 101.,2019-09-20T17:51:34.077,1269
15596,5925,1,If you think what you say then you should have your students program in machine code (not assembler). Higher level languages will get them into the bad habit of relying on the compiler (to do a better job than they could ever do). An alternative is to change your belief and use a high level language.,2019-09-20T20:31:02.160,204
15597,5927,0,Question is what is the learning target for that particular segment of the course? Also I've never seen a text intended to beginners explaining C++ various types of smart pointers without referring to raw pointers.,2019-09-22T08:07:36.170,2103

15599,5929,0,Instead of linking to the whole essay could you take some screencaps of the diagrams you're looking to recreate? That'd make it easier on potential answerers.

15616,5943,0,I was bored because it seemed far for real world applications. My students are 18 and are about to start learning computer science. They have never learned algorithms. So I'm trying to find a fun way to teach them that topic.,2019-09-28T19:35:08.467,8464

15626,5924,1,IMHO they should be taught even before any consideration of avoiding code duplication as a way to structure the thought giving significant names to user defined actions (groups of instructions). Important in the process of writing code step by step. If you chose plain Java for teaching to beginners the `static` keyword is already present for the unavoidable main().,2019-09-29T15:22:31.190,2103

15633,5924,0,Well I'm quite sure that you should at least know some control structures to see how useful functions/methods are to avoid code duplication. Before that point you only declared and initialized some variables so I can't even imagine how to demonstrate the use of functions/methods in a proper way.,2019-09-30T21:17:29.070,8354
15634,4637,0,Not necessarily though that depends on exact interest. If one wants to write GUI applications some classes and OOP are unavoidable. However one can start with just solving algorithmic problems and for that classes (meaning: defining classes) aren't necessary or very useful. However some STL classes are very handy and would be a pity not to use them.,2019-09-30T22:34:39.163,4884
15635,4637,0,As I wrote in the answer I don't think C++ is a good language for learning Object and Object Oriented programming due to the implementation being much too sensitive to low-level details.

15646,4797,0,It always seems not good to me when assertions are made about we as in all humans; evidence suggests that for any imaginable feature differing options exist. The correspondence between sequential thoughts and state transitions holds only at a very initial level and I believe it's the root of the difficulty so many students meet. Furthermore speaking simply from *my* point of view what you say is not true I think functionally. In my very first moments with programming I was surprised that C did not behave like Haskell which I didn't know: I would have appreciated to be shown it existed.,2019-10-06T19:06:15.413,6546

15651,5956,0,_@Buffy I agree so let me paraphrase my 3rd paragraph: While you may thing that you should choose a language that will be asked about in an interview as this seems like the quickest way to arrive at where you want to be. I strongly suspect that it is faster to first learn to program (with whatever language makes this easier) and then learn a language (the one that you will be asked about),2019-10-07T17:52:24.923,204
15652,5960,0,Ah yes tokens are syntactic elements (the scanner handles these). The other three are semantic elements. The parser handles them structurally and the semantic analyzer imputes meaning to them.,2019-10-07T20:50:11.680,1293

15660,5962,1,Let me note for the record that the form you are using is actually a merging of BNF (which doesn't include * or +) and regular expressions which do. Regular expressions normally define scanners and BNF describes parsers. BNF is strictly more powerful than regular expressions but uses recursive forms rather than repetition. I hope you aren't confused about that. Most language definitions use both but for very different things (scanners v parsers).,2019-10-08T10:08:44.237,1293
15661,5962,0,Let me also note that the source you point to is ambiguous. In particular a ... z is only a hint about the meaning not the definition. Which language alphabet is implied or assumed? English French?? I suggest that you use a more formal definition of RE and BNF than you see at that link. Otherwise you risk confusing your students if they come across the proper definitions which many will eventually though perhaps not for adult ed. But the instructor needs a firmer grounding in any case.,2019-10-08T10:44:39.763,1293
15662,5960,0,I know expressions statements & blocks end up first decomposed to tokens then after subsequent analysis meaning is imputted to. But that's not the question. My students are asking if tokens are the small elements from which these more sophisticated combinations are built shouldn't they conceptually be grouped in a category of their own even if for learning purposes? Hence as social scientists used to arguing over concepts they demanded a category to embrace these higher programming constructs. Do we have one or can someone attempt to coin one for me?,2019-10-08T12:16:06.360,8489
15663,5963,0,What else are you doing to learn C? Watching lectures won't really teach you anything. You need more. Are you in a course? Are you following some good book - with exercises?,2019-10-08T12:48:23.133,1293
15664,5964,3,I'll note here that these examples are all expressible as regular expressions. The actual power of BNF isn't needed for these.,2019-10-08T12:53:14.387,1293
15665,5965,3,The examples are all simple forms that can be expressed (and are actually) as regular expressions. BNF is about structure more than these indicate.,2019-10-08T12:54:14.870,1293
15666,5963,0,I am following a book called C in Depth which is by an Indian author after reading it I found out NewBoston channel was skipping many things in his video lectures Should I read this book only?,2019-10-08T13:38:16.593,8486
15667,5963,0,No actually. you should do more. I don't know the book. But if it has exercises do them (preferably all of them). And get feedback on your solutions from somewhere.,2019-10-08T13:41:42.917,1293
15668,5966,0,I think you made a typo in the definition of `propulsionSystem`.,2019-10-08T22:04:00.657,5963
15669,5966,0,_@SolomonUcko worse than a typo. A logical error. An infinite recursion. Oh my. Fixed now.,2019-10-08T22:34:45.880,1293
15670,5962,0,_@Buffy given the context it would be better to ask which encoding is assumed. That was an example they clarify it in [the next chapter](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers): Within the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F) the valid characters for identifiers are the same as in Python 2.x: the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z ...,2019-10-09T08:20:50.933,3472
15671,5960,1,Characters & strings of characters (used in tokenizing) are smaller syntactic & semantic units than tokens. You yourself have just talked about characters that mean something to the compiler. We normally talk about a pass of a compiler for which we posit new atomic parts non-atomic groupings input & output.,2019-10-10T06:55:30.490,2485
15672,5969,1,Welcome to [cseducators.se]. A very interesting question and an observation I've more or less reached as well. Research and statistics would be interesting to see.,2019-10-10T14:56:24.320,104
15673,5970,2,Google is your friend.,2019-10-10T20:38:21.967,1293
15674,5960,0,Yea philipxy the atomic/non-atomic characterization is    a close match. However non-atomic applies to a much larger set than expressions statements  & blocks. That's why I hesitated to use that. However as you said earlier  catgories are. made as needed even if imperfect. Perhaps I'll settle for that for now then keep searching and thinking of a tighter term. Thanks,2019-10-11T12:27:21.947,8489
15675,5970,1,Google has been not friendly lately but I will try again. Thanks!,2019-10-11T15:17:24.260,6410
15676,5970,0,It's been noted before that most resources are not organized this way. I'm not sure why even one online resource is hard to find but that does seem to be the case.,2019-10-11T16:51:27.373,27
15677,5969,0,Yes it all started with the decline of Unix and the uptake of the cheaper dos and then MS Windows.,2019-10-11T17:38:49.457,204
15678,5969,0,As for Linux did you mean Gnu/Linux (all of the top 500 super computers around 80% of the web most of the internet fastest growing OS). And Linux is just a kernel (not an operating system Gnu/Linux is the OS) and Linux is in over half (75%) of those pesky phones.,2019-10-11T17:43:16.603,204
15679,5972,0,Things are not always getting better (they are mainly just getting cheaper). Unix (including Gnu/Linux) is easier than Microsoft's Windows. You don't have to use the command line but it makes it easier for experienced users. See also the future of programming by Bret Victor -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4,2019-10-11T17:55:05.080,204
15680,5972,2,_@ctrl-alt-delor I think easier is subjective. I personally do not find Unix easier than Windows. Probably depends on what you're accustomed to more than anything else.,2019-10-11T18:08:23.337,2068
15681,5974,1,Could you post some links that describe Raspberry Pi's goals of improving computer literacy? Have they said that smart phones have decreased literacy?,2019-10-11T18:39:35.953,2068
15682,5958,0,I wonder whether I just managed now to parse your question as you intended. Are you asking what is the name for non-token language element? In a grammar the literals (eg tokens) are terminals & everything else (rule or its associated set of expressions/strings/trees) is a non-terminal. But I had thought from your last line you that were asking about acategory containing just expression/statement/block. (Whatever you think of those as.) Can you clarify?,2019-10-11T19:16:07.447,2485
15683,5974,0,_@KevinWorkman At least the part that they are trying to improve computer literacy is proven by quotes on [their web site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/). See: We provide low-cost high-performance computers that people use to learn solve problems and have fun. We provide outreach and education to help more people access computing and digital making. We develop free resources to help people learn about computing and how to make things with computers and train educators who can guide other people to learn.,2019-10-11T22:14:26.003,8354
15684,5974,0,_@csabinho To me that sounds like they're trying to make it easier for novices to start learning about computer science. Does having more novices in the industry mean that general computer literacy is increasing or does it mean that it's decreasing? (My point is that this question doesn't really have an answer but it's a fun mental exercise.),2019-10-11T22:39:31.170,2068
15685,5974,0,_@KevinWorkman In my opinion they are definitely aiming to increase average computer literacy. If you just go by the average of all users it's absolutely logical that the computer literacy was at an unbeatable level back in the days when only some nerds had access to computers but in a world that gets more and more digital people should have a minimum level of digital literacy also on an abstract level or in other words: they should understand concepts of the digital world. And of course such questions have no real and definitive answers just as most questions on this page don't have them!,2019-10-11T22:51:18.377,8354
15686,5974,0,Another project that has this aim is micro:bit by BBC which is also used at schools in the UK!,2019-10-11T22:52:58.567,8354
15687,5970,0,Jeff Erickson's page (U of Illinois) is a good source with plenty of materials but the provided solutions are quite fragmented.,2019-10-11T23:31:44.763,6410
15688,5780,0,Regarding the last paragraph: wouldn't it be better to raise general awareness and have a few lessons about common error messages and hints than prohibiting students to use tools that are used almost everywhere in real life? Of course you have to try to change the trained mindset of your students but they will benefit from this their whole life!,2019-10-12T00:46:55.753,8354
15689,5972,0,what is your background?,2019-10-12T17:34:20.697,204
15690,5780,0,I'm okay with it highlighting error messages. That's not what I'm talking about here. It's when NetBeans suggests another way of writing a loop or condition or something else. But it's usually a loop or condition. Usually when it does that the suggestion is out of scope for the course I'm teaching or whatever it suggests confuses the student. Sometimes it's something we just haven't gotten to yet. They go with it because it works but have no clue why.,2019-10-12T18:24:08.920,30
15691,5780,0,They go with it because it works but have no clue why. Nobody should EVER do this when learning to code. Maybe you'll have to stress this a bit more. Or let the students explain their submitted code if the size of your class allows it.,2019-10-12T18:59:50.627,8354
15692,5780,0,Agreed. That's why I prefer to not use an IDE that drops hints with my intro students whenever possible. I want to see their solution not the editor's solution.,2019-10-13T02:22:58.633,30
15693,4107,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor: The straightforward answer (that minimizes reworking your infrastructure) is then for them to have a folder where they both have access. Whether you create one big folder where everyone has access and pairs are expected to stick to their folder or whether you create actual folders with specific rights for each pair is a matter of implementation and what your admins are willing to put up with.,2019-10-13T23:09:12.707,2164
15694,5972,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor I'm not sure I understand the question. I have a BS and MS in Computer Science and I've been a software engineer for 10 years if that's what you're asking?,2019-10-14T20:13:28.770,2068
15696,5972,0,_@ctrl-alt-delor In which sense do you mean easier? The OS formerly known as MacOS claims to be the easiest OS to use still for me it seems more like the hardest because the UI works completely differently than the UIs I'm used to are working.,2019-10-15T08:03:39.250,8354
15697,5970,0,Could you clarify *online*? Would a paper textbook whose code is available online meet your needs?,2019-10-15T08:26:12.443,1219
15698,5970,0,_@PeterTaylor sure! I have access to the library and I can easily get a hard copy.,2019-10-15T17:07:20.930,6410
15699,5972,0,_@csabinho continued in chat https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/59174/the-classroom ( https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/52139273#52139273 ),2019-10-15T18:02:27.993,204
15700,5980,0,That's a great resource! It would be perfect if we could find also solved problems in the style of Jeff Erickson's Algorithms textbook.,2019-10-15T22:29:30.067,6410
15701,5972,0,Interesting point on the issue of knowledge = people * their knowledge vs. knowledge = knowledge of the persons knowing anything at all. On the first point I definitely agree the literacy went up but for the latter I think it decreased and the answers seem to agree with me but it seems like there is only anecdotal evidence.,2019-10-16T06:25:30.270,8497
15702,5971,0,This goes into the same direction as @Kevin Workmans answer and I think you're onto something but it seems like there's not much work on this issue.,2019-10-16T06:26:57.080,8497
15703,5122,0,Does you results mean 72 students received 100 and the rest received 0? If not what was the distribution of results?,2019-10-16T15:48:46.770,6432
15704,5969,0,Your edit makes the question sound a bit like a hunt for why modern technology is bad instead of a genuine attempt to figure out what is going on. If KevinWorkman is right then there has been no decrease in computer literacy and comparing all computer users across the different times is comparing apples to oranges as the populations are simply different.,2019-10-17T10:19:05.850,27
15708,5958,0,Well what about program elements ?,2019-10-18T11:52:54.693,2103
15712,5728,0,I am using Code.org and I want to assess their projects differently and outside that platform too. I didn't know about the Linters to check the codes. However I don't understand how to use it. I am reading the documentation in Github about it and my question is; Can I install on my computer the HtmlInt and having run on a text file that a student creates and I will be able to see the results like that? How do you use it? Thank you so much in advance and thank you for the different resources you mentioned. I am checking them all by now.,2019-10-08T00:54:02.723,8491
15713,5963,0,What is your background (What do you know already? and what is your experience?). What are you trying to achieve?,2019-10-18T19:12:57.700,204
15714,5963,0,And amend question with your responses.,2019-10-18T19:14:26.037,204
15715,5985,0,The computer science bachelor's degrees I know don't even focus on programming in the first year or even semester. For instance the reason for the most dropouts is math. And it gets even broader in the following years as you mentioned.,2019-10-18T19:40:16.400,8354
15716,5975,0,Thank you very much!!,2019-10-19T19:19:20.053,8476
15717,5988,0,True the axiomatic method was mostly a product of late 19th and early 20th century thought. It unified rather than created (some) mathematics. But today a lot of students learn with methods informed by that development.,2019-10-19T20:25:41.677,1293
15718,5983,2,There are [Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Software_Engineering) degrees also.,2019-10-20T10:09:59.293,1333

15720,5988,0,_@DanielR.Collins  this is not a contradiction with the fact that mathematicians mostly work from top to bottom. You start from a conjecture (often false as you'll discover later) try to reduce to sub-problems (lemmas and properties) and down to commonly accepted statements. Axioms if you are encline to formality or proof left to the reader. Or obviously.,2019-10-21T13:24:35.127,2103
15723,5990,0,Considering the range of material included in the term combinatorics perhaps you could reduce the target to something which does not include the entire field of mathematics. Otherwise it just a fancy word for counting.,2019-10-21T22:25:16.523,104
15724,5990,0,Also look at books named Finite Mathematics. And do you mean secondary school or university?,2019-10-22T00:00:26.200,1293
15725,5990,0,P.S need such combinatorics after which I can understand the course of data structures and algorithms. Also understand the course of computing algorithms.,2019-10-22T03:52:35.187,8187
15726,5990,0,Can I tell you what the differences between the first college graduate and the last grade of school? I live in Russia and here the education system is arranged differently. I heard that in the USA after school most go to college and some go to university. But in fact your college is our university and even then our quality will be lower. This is if we compared.,2019-10-22T03:58:01.687,8187
15727,5990,0,If you want to make a permanent addition to the site (that would also help many of us to answer this question and future questions like it) any contributions [here](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/204/what-are-common-terms-used-in-education-in-different-countries) would be most welcome.,2019-10-22T10:30:15.767,27
15737,5994,0,Yes I can see that as a problem. But on a side note: a method can be a function or a procedure (some people make a mash up of the two but this is usually an anti-pattern and I can't remember the case where it is not).,2019-10-24T18:18:59.853,204
15738,5997,0,You understood the opposite of what I meant: I refuse to use the language of normal people for fear that when I use the language of the trade my words will not be recognized.,2019-10-25T00:50:51.367,8043
15739,5997,0,OK I get you now. Yes keeping non technical usage of jargon out can help. E.g. instead of use this method one could say: use this style for the common meaning.,2019-10-25T06:25:17.167,8489
15740,5994,0,*Session* also has jargon meanings.,2019-10-25T07:15:52.217,1219
15741,5995,2,Your example combines a type definition and the declaration of 2 variables.  And for your students it is probably the first occurrence of a User Defined Datatype.,2019-10-25T11:55:23.463,2103
15742,5995,1,Also why should your students buy `cartW.orangeNos `instead of the `int cartW_orangeNos` variable they already can think of? A good motivation would be a function with a cart as an argument (say `void print_cart(struct ShoppingCart * c)`).,2019-10-25T12:01:46.087,2103
15745,5994,0,Are you asking about why it is _important_ to use jargon correctly or how we can _avoid_ jargon and use generic terms? I can actually say a lot more about the difference between math and CS in the use of terms _variable_ and _function_. The concepts are very different in the two fields.,2019-10-25T12:40:49.650,1293
15746,5994,0,Suggest a _non-jargon_ context in which this might be important. Not a class lecture I assume.,2019-10-25T12:51:06.710,1293
15747,6001,2,Since I know this is going to get flagged I will preemptively post this: before flagging to close the question please read the description for the [tag:curriculum-review] tag. This is one of a handful of special tags [available on this site](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/187/introducing-the-new-tags-curriculum-review-lesson-review-and-materials-re?r=SearchResults) that are a little different from many of the other sites.  I haven't examined this question closely but my instinct is that with maybe a little editing it reasonably follows the model required by the tag.,2019-10-25T16:53:43.107,27
15748,5998,0,Thanks never thought of approaching the topic close to the metal like that. Interesting.,2019-10-25T18:46:11.967,8489
15749,5995,0,The topic is structs. The example is to illustrate structs. Are you suggesting making a function a member of the struct to handle the shopping cart data?  That would introduce more complications don't you think?,2019-10-25T18:53:23.773,8489
15750,5999,0,I like that idea of breaking up each part and drilling + using point struct. I have a feeling that should help..  Will try using that and see if it heThanks,2019-10-25T18:55:47.017,8489
15751,5958,0,Program elements is the main topic. The issue is some program elements are called tokens and these are the atomic pieces what will those pieces aggregated into expressions statements and blocks be designated by collectively?,2019-10-26T01:14:43.230,8489
15752,5999,0,Yea Pointers presents lot of challenges too but not as bad as structs,2019-10-26T01:19:47.347,8489
15753,6002,0,The curriculum requires I teach struct as a separate topic after earlier treating arrays functions & pointers. So like you said I have to teach it's own syntax. Also bear in mind it is an intro course-.,2019-10-26T01:30:58.800,8489
15754,6002,0,I don't understand your points.  xy coordinate is a simple concept at least in the real world.  comparing structs to arrays to build on existing knowledge would probably best be done after learning arrays.,2019-10-26T01:59:14.437,3799
15756,6002,0,Yea was just telling you I got more insights from your suggestion. I did an edit that didn't come on that comment that's why you didn't see where I'm heading. I'll retry see if it will  show.,2019-10-26T02:19:50.783,8489
15757,5995,1,I suggest you make functions with structs as parameters. I definitely not recommend you to use functions as members at this stage of learning C. C is not C++.,2019-10-26T12:36:48.040,2103
15758,6002,0,The example of 2D or 3D coordinates automatically calls for the remark : why don't we use an array of 2 of 3 numbers? Better choose a struct with members of different types.,2019-10-26T12:40:34.303,2103
15759,5998,1,You'll need such considerations when describing bit-fields members and unions.,2019-10-26T12:42:03.723,2103
15760,5995,0,I see. Awesome! Your suggestion will help me kill 2 birds with one stone. It will consolidate learning of functions and at the same time underline the value of struct as a data structure.  Oh thanks bro! You made my day,2019-10-26T15:06:26.587,8489
15761,6002,0,I add the edit I made on my first comment that did not show up below...  Your suggestion and that of @Ben I. have spinned off in my mind this example.       (code sample)  struct Point { int x y; }; int main() { struct Point p1 = {1 2};    //initialize var. // p2 is a pointer to structure p1 struct Point *p2 = &p1;     //create pointer // Accessing structure members using structure pointer printf(%d %d p2->x p2->y); return 0; },2019-10-26T15:17:09.093,8489
15762,6002,0,Having trouble getting my code to display well. Someone help edit to get it format well.,2019-10-26T15:20:34.760,8489
15763,6003,0,Yes examples galore. I do that. Class coding galore too l do. I appreciate especially your use of complex nos bank account & library catalogue examples. You folks are really widening my repertoire of example concepts. Thanks. Keep them coming.,2019-10-26T18:27:34.580,8489
15764,5958,1,Perhaps Token groups covers it. Or perhaps Compound tokens would fit. My preference is for Expressions Statements Blocks. Each is different yet composed of tokens. In social science speak you have taboos mores and norms. Similar functions culturally without being in the same classification without creating one artificially.,2019-10-27T02:16:15.923,104
15765,5999,0,Anyway in C you have to come to pointers rather quickly because of 1) strings 2) lack of parameter passing by reference.  But dynamic allocation and linked structures - often presented under the name teaching pointers  - can be safely seen much later.,2019-10-27T08:59:32.177,2103

15771,5995,0,Are you teaching out of a mainstream textbook? Usually that solves a lot of problems; people have spent a lot more time thinking designing and testing the scaffolding & examples than you'll ever have time on your own.,2019-10-27T19:51:16.730,8137

15774,6004,0,_@MallamAwal Yes I know that. What I am saying is that it is not a good example: Not because it is simplified but because it can not work if extended **(Try it)** pupils will puck up on this. However they will not say to them-selves This is a bad example they will say I don't get it. That is they will assume that they are making the mistake. That they are interpreting it wrong and will try to interpret it a different way.,2019-10-28T08:47:13.747,204

15783,6005,1,An interrupt is like being interrupted. With the caveat that you go back to what you were doing when you finish being interrupted.,2019-10-29T23:02:53.560,204
15784,5943,0,I do sorting and searching using cards.You need to ensure that you have enough and that you don't have a simple sequence (or the students will choose other algorithms that don't otherwise make sense).,2019-10-29T23:11:03.410,204
15785,6008,1,You did not disappoint. That is a beautiful answer!,2019-10-30T03:01:31.073,27
15786,6008,1,I really like this activity as an explanation of interrupts but I think it may detract from the learning of the students being interrupted or being assigned those simple tasks.,2019-10-30T05:16:15.550,58
15787,6008,1,_@thesecretmaster The learning of the students shouldn't be impacted as the main assignment is planned in the prep section specifically to be interrupted. Aside from seeming to be legitimate so that the students do it the assigned work need have no purpose other than giving them something to do until the interrupts occur.,2019-10-30T05:30:59.443,104
15788,5728,0,`I can run unit tests on Java and C# to make sure the code students are submitting is correct without an issue` I can write code that does what it's supposed to passes every test and will still be flagged as a massive issue in any reasonable code review (if you want an example remove all newlines and tabs from your code and rename your variables to randomized 15 letter strings). Am I to infer from this that your lessons do not include readability of code? Because if readability was a lesson focus quite obviously you should try to (and be able to) read your students' code as well.,2019-10-30T10:31:22.900,2164
15789,5935,0,Why the self-learning tag? Your question is what you as a teacher can do for your students no?,2019-10-30T11:55:26.697,2164
15790,5935,0,_@Flater Good catch.,2019-10-30T12:21:00.797,27
15791,6010,1,There are plenty of nice insights in this answer.  FWIW when I first introduce functions to beginners I use it as a way to introduce great descriptive function names.  The initial benefits at first sight are that we understand easily what the (no longer) large method is doing and we have an easier time piecing back together what the code inside the function does thanks to the **great name**.  Using functions essentially as labels at the start gives them a clear purpose starts students off with good naming habits and easily leads into their further use later.,2019-10-30T12:27:15.923,27
15792,6011,0,A classic of course. But mostly for the fact that such descriptions of process are too often lacking. What isn't an algorithm is a valuable lesson. Tie your shoelaces is even worse. I think.,2019-10-30T14:36:37.917,1293

15795,6010,0,Watch out for that specific example (3-4-5 right triangle) because IME the answer is often because I memorized it [the Pythagorean triple]. Or sometimes just parroting the arithmetic sequence.,2019-10-31T18:34:00.923,8137
15796,6013,1,Any reason you don't want to use source control? GitHub and specifically GitHub Classroom hits all of the other points.,2019-10-31T22:10:03.223,30
15797,6013,0,I know but this is the first time they'll code and I try to lower the cognitive load for now. I want the students not to focus on the tools and the environment. Thanks anyway :),2019-10-31T22:10:58.763,6859
15798,6013,1,This seems like overkill for ten students. Especially if they meet face to face. Paper printouts works is cheap and simple. Easy to comment also.,2019-11-01T00:07:23.920,1293
15799,6012,1,At this level I think good projects need some scaffolding - starter code. What language are you interested in? There are a lot of things available for Java but there is a subset of the code already in place. It is a lot to ask of a first year student to do much that is interesting from scratch given the knowledge they have when they start the project.,2019-11-01T09:43:17.660,1293
15800,6005,1,_@Daniel R. Collins yea got it. Exactly What it says on the tin... Inter...rupt!,2019-11-01T09:44:43.063,8489

15802,5963,0,To clarify- you are not learning in order to teach (or are you?).  I found Harvards CS50 excellent to (re)learn C.  There are also some excellent Arduino coding series using C on YouTube.  As asked above- what are you hoping to achieve?  There will always be more to learn.  Anyone that says they know it all does not know enough to know better imho.,2019-11-01T18:37:43.547,2706
15804,6023,0,Yea i've grappled with it and appreciate the messiness. The word is nuanced between the languages and in the way it is used by authors that its tricky doing a satisfactorily rounded simple definition. But iam beginning to see the light from your definition.                                   My key take aways from your definition is it is:  sequence of words/symbols complete legal not about what the program does but how it is built up. Much insightful.,2019-11-03T07:36:28.197,8489
15805,6022,1,I suspect you'll do better working by analogy than by definition though I admit I am having trouble thinking of one of those too.,2019-11-03T12:34:34.243,27
15807,6025,0,Have you looked at repl.it?  There is a way to set up a classroom in there as well and it might tick some of the boxes...,2019-11-04T16:00:11.230,2706
15808,6025,0,Security isn't always easy or quick. Based on that points 2 and 3 are opposed. I don't know AWS but I suspect that as long as it accepts SSH with RSA keys that AWS is not the problem. If you can resolve the conflict between #2 and #3 I believe it can be worked out rather simply. The quick distribution/setup could be resolved using a BASH script. Happy to help.,2019-11-04T17:03:56.600,104
15809,5922,0,Note that the book _Karel J Robot_ has the students write classes and methods prior to introducing conditionals or iteration. In fact it has almost no use of variables (other than references to objects) and no use of int variables and such. Polymorphism comes before iteration in fact.,2019-11-05T00:55:23.760,1293
15810,6017,0,_a system in which only low grades could be earned from a simpler assignment. I think that is psychologically damaging._ It also teaches the wrong philosophy. Developers should always strive for the simplest solution that covers the needed cases. Any developer who takes on additional complexity for no other reason than showing off is a problematic developer who needs to be told to tone it down (note: in a professional context - not an educational one),2019-11-05T11:36:36.643,2164
15811,6019,0,I disagree that **elective** additional complexity should be rewarded. It teaches the opposite of what you want developers to strive for. Good solutions minimize complexity. I'm not saying there aren't cases where the complex solution actually is better but students are going to take underlying philosophies to heart subconsciously and you should only ask them to add complexity when it is warranted by the requirements.,2019-11-05T11:39:13.103,2164
15812,6027,0,You seem to fail to understand some really fundamental things. One minor one (not the worst) is that functions (in all paradigms) are not primarily there so that you don't need to repeat yourself. That is just a by-product. A good Pascal program has a lot of functions that are called exactly once.,2019-11-05T11:40:19.800,1293
15813,6027,0,_@Buffy: Which is why I separately mention the purposes of abstraction and DRY. The example you're highlighting (one-reference-methods) is one of abstraction (most commonly encountered for separation of concerns),2019-11-05T11:43:03.890,2164
15814,6027,0,And if you really conflate static and non-static methods you have a really fundamental misunderstanding of how a language like Java actually runs. The chagrin of your teachers may be well justified. Learn to use your tools.,2019-11-05T11:43:15.483,1293
15815,6027,1,_@Buffy: I didn't claim that there's no real-world difference between statics and non-statics during runtime. I said that my core definition of what a function/method is (i.e. a small compartmentalized algorithm) is independent of whether that function happens to be static or not. should I make this static and should I use a function/method are two questions that are independent of eachother. Both should be evaluated but their answers are not related (one's answer does not suggest the other's answer),2019-11-05T11:44:45.317,2164
15816,6027,0,Then I question whether you understand _scope_. These sorts of things can't really be glossed over without giving students a burden of misinformation that they will eventually have to fight their way past.,2019-11-05T11:46:45.100,1293
15817,6027,0,_@Buffy: Asking students who have not yet seen objects to understand scope is massively putting the cart before the horse. As of right now OP's students (in the question) only know the global scope. And again I'm not saying that these things (static function scope) should be ignored I'm saying that they can be evaluated independently of one another (and most definitely **taught** in independent lessons before expecting students to consider them all at the same time),2019-11-05T11:47:47.500,2164
15818,6027,0,_@Buffy: It seems you think I'm dismissing static vs nonstatic as irrelevant. I'm not. What I'm saying is that when you are explaining the difference between a function and a method what you're really explaining to me is the difference between global statics and objects (i.e. their scope difference). The core definition (a small compartmentalized algorithm) remains unchanged regardless of its scope.,2019-11-05T11:54:47.437,2164
15819,6028,0,The definition is not a must. It was just sugar he wanted to add to his assignment and seeing the diligence and zeal he went about it I felt we could help lend a hand. & we have: with your rephrase of his definition and explanations immediately following it + @Buffy's earlier one he is good to go. I shall let him read this thread and do a draft definition he can ultimately use. Thanks people,2019-11-05T15:19:33.423,8489
15820,6029,1,If I had a blog. Final version ought to be a Pulitzer.,2019-11-06T08:57:05.700,104
15821,6013,0,_@Infinity: The proper tools can hide most of Git's complexity. If you e.g. use SourceTree and help students get it set up it requires little effort to get going and GitHub (classroom or not) does exactly what you want it to do. In general solutions with a lot of features tend to be more complex. You're asking for a lot of features and thus some complexity is inevitable.,2019-11-06T11:59:44.223,2164
15822,4230,0,_@Elkady To clarify myself at the entry level I'm not opposed to teaching C++ or old-school C to essentially the same effect. Pointers are very handy for teaching the concept of reference vs value. Even if they're not used or not recommended to be used it's a great teaching tool.,2019-11-06T14:38:11.767,4082
15823,6029,0,Question: How you done software development in the workplace? While this is pretty great conceptually it smacks over overly theoretical pure OOP philosophy that one sees in academia but not so much in real engineering work IME.,2019-11-06T19:22:44.277,8137
15824,6029,1,_@DanielR.Collins it depends on what you mean. I've never had a boss telling me what or how to write. But I've consulted to companies on their software process which can be appalling. I mostly produce educational software (large and complex) with something over 20000 users. And yes I eat my own dog food. (Actually the last time I had such a boss was waaaaay back on a FORTRAN project.) Also. I'm focused on the first course here. I also normally use Agile software practice in conjunction with the things I recommend here. Unit tests frequent delivery and all that.,2019-11-06T19:31:12.343,1293
15825,6033,0,I appreciate your enthusiasm but the students won?€?t even be able to do that by the end of the class let alone the beginning. I?€?m pretty sure no one but the well self-studied (whom I don?€?t need to reach) can even write a Python or Java quine.,2019-11-06T19:34:06.687,8043
15826,6033,0,Actually a machine language Quine is a lot easier than one in Java. You don't have to carry as much of the structure of a program to get it done. Try it yourself.,2019-11-06T19:35:42.137,1293
15827,5923,0,One major pedagogical problem with objects-late is that students practice the essential parts of OO programming the least. If you start with objects then everything else you do gets to reinforce those early lessons on object structure. Doing it the other way doesn't permit that same level of reinforcement. Learning is by reinforcement and feedback not by having information _logically_ presented.,2019-11-06T19:41:27.413,1293
15829,6029,1,_@Buffy Thanks so much for your many detailed comments. This answer takes me back to MIT 6.001 SICP that I took at HP. It literally changed my whole career as I learned a whole new way of looking at programs.,2019-11-06T20:52:24.250,6432
15830,6029,0,What a tour de force! This is possibly the most substantial (and possibly the most important) answer I have seen on CSEd so far. I regret only that I have but one upvote to give.,2019-11-07T00:39:42.427,27
15831,6029,0,Ah @BenI. but it put me over 26K. ;-),2019-11-07T00:44:30.813,1293
15832,6029,0,_@BenI. and as for paradigms it turns out recent version of SQL are Turing complete. I once met a person who used it as a programming language for general purpose stuff.,2019-11-07T00:47:58.253,1293
15833,6029,0,I agree with being consistent to the paradigm. & for learning to teach to the dictates of a paradigm well. That presupposes some time and experience on your hand. For a man coming to teach under pressure to deliver results now and possibly without previous such preparation and possibly students too not previously exposed to the more  mundane syntax and previous knowledge what do you do?,2019-11-07T00:56:50.717,8489
15834,6029,0,And also your answer is not dense. It is what this forum is all about: letting that heavily accumulated stuff on the stack spill over to us so together we are better off. It was beautiful exposition got many take aways from it especially the philosophy of staying consistent to the paradigm being taught.,2019-11-07T01:03:09.877,8489
15835,6034,1,See this earlier question: https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/302/1293,2019-11-07T01:37:46.743,1293
15836,6037,0,The thread helped with more insight on writing them but not construction of non Computer based ones. Glad at least knowing where some online samples are. Regards. Your magnetic surface concept is more interesting for my intent,2019-11-07T08:52:32.417,8489
15837,4230,0,I understand But this is no more in modern C++. We use references instead.  The beauty of it is that you don't have to change the function call if you switched your function from pass-by-value to pass-by-reference.  And there is no more loosing your address.,2019-11-07T16:39:11.147,3417
15838,4230,0,Example: I can write my function as :,2019-11-07T16:39:37.013,3417
15839,4230,0,Void myfunc (int param). //pass by value.  Or.  Void myfunc (int &param) // pass by reference.  In bother cases the function is called using an int variable. The the parameter param is used inside the function as an int not a pointer,2019-11-07T16:42:05.800,3417
15840,4230,0,Finally in modern programming even if we want to use pointers we should use smart pointers not the old c style pointers. Smart pointers ensure there we don't get memory leaks,2019-11-07T16:45:51.483,3417
15841,6032,1,Going through an array column by column is slower than row by row even though they give the same result using the same approach. Seems like that's a result of how you represent the array rather than an inherent property of arrays.,2019-11-08T05:37:44.210,3225
15842,6032,0,...ooh maybe I misunderstood the professor. Isn?€?t incrementing the pointer by the size of the objects in the array less expensive than multiplying by the length of the array? Wouldn?€?t going column by column require n*n multiplications rather than n multiplications making it slower for increasingly large values?,2019-11-08T12:33:39.360,8043
15843,6032,2,FWIW: bare metal and assembly language don't usually mean the same thing. Bare metal usually refers to an embedded application that runs directly out of read-only memory with no operating system.  I am working on a bare-metal project right now that so far has about two hundred lines of C and C++ code for every line of assembly code.  I expect that ratio to be higher in the end because I am not writing any new lines of assembler.,2019-11-08T21:16:18.173,1269
15845,6023,0,This kind of confusion does not arise if you start with a definition like: *A computer is a metal thing with moving (electrical) parts inside that can be set up to perform desired actions.* Since a computer is not a thinking being nothing is lost in this simplification. Then you just say: *Lazy people find increasingly complex ways to set the thing up to do repetitive actions. (see: Computer Language).* It is when we try to start the explanation somewhere else that all the problems arise. Computers *are* machines it is the human mind and its complexity that makes them seem otherwise.,2019-11-09T21:34:19.620,5349
15846,6028,1,Gosh here I was thinking I was a teacher just so I could get paid for my students to present me with new insights day after day! Maybe I have a different definition of *teacher* and *student*.,2019-11-09T21:43:21.313,5349
15847,6040,2,I think you nailed it with the distinction between different paradigms rather than just different syntax. That's really what I'm after.  I hadn't thought about SQL. That's a good one. And the report idea is on point as well.,2019-11-10T16:13:07.783,30
15849,6040,1,If they write reports based on research help them a bit with proper quoting and citations so they learn how and why to avoid plagiarism.,2019-11-10T21:22:08.803,1293
15850,6041,0,This sounds like the 'examples of' sort of course With students expected to somehow grok it by osmosis.,2019-11-10T21:23:36.497,1293
15851,6040,0,Note that according to the _Spiral_ Pedagogical Pattern it is good for students to return (several times) to a topic with each cycle going deeper into the subject. An implication is that a first exposure need not be terribly deep if they will return later for more - even if that return is in a later course.,2019-11-10T21:25:42.830,1293
15852,6041,0,_@Buffy It was deeply deeply awful. I abandoned CS for years as a direct result of that class.,2019-11-10T22:02:12.623,27
15853,6032,0,Presumably you are discussing an array in which each element is itself an array and this array represents a two-dimension array. And you're saying that when you iterate it's faster to match your iteration nesting to the array nesting (outer iteration loop iterates over outer array). So far so good. But then your position seems to be resting on the unstated assumption that the inner arrays represent rows.,2019-11-10T22:27:45.777,3225
15854,6032,3,My point is that your wording makes it sound like there is some difference between rows and columns but it is more accurate to word it in terms of inner and outer arrays. That going by rows is faster is an aspect of the *representation* not anything intrinsic to rows. As far as the actual data is concerned there are no rows or columns. That's just an abstraction we place on top of it.,2019-11-10T22:27:51.890,3225
15855,6040,0,I agree about the importance of ways of thinking. When I am learning a programming language I prefer a book that teaches the language from first principles rather than a conversion from a language I already know. The point is to learn e.g. how to think about variables in the new language.,2019-11-11T09:48:42.617,6558
15857,6040,0,For assemblers: an early ARM. It might even be possible to do away with the emulator and use a cheap development board. And if you want to go even lower level (although probably needing a more expensive development board) Verilog or VHDL.,2019-11-12T09:22:36.967,1219
15858,6049,0,I am only a TA. Also these students will likely freak out knowing that they will be introduced to **three** new things (C x86-64 asm and Forth). Your suggestion can help other teachers though!,2019-11-12T23:17:47.117,8043
15859,6047,0,Is this a [tag:self-learning] question?,2019-11-13T14:02:24.307,27
15860,6042,0,Seems you are trying to demonstrate JavaFx drawing primitives a very non-typical way: text-based loop interface drawing to a non-interactive Scene avoiding all event-driven stuff.,2019-11-13T15:06:02.877,2103
15861,6042,0,That's right.  The usual approach to introducing graphics early is to make a library class with static methods that can all of the ugly stuff.  In the past when I used Swing I could give them a template of real code.  It had a lot of boilerplate but working within it proved quite tractable for students.  More importantly it was something I could grow nicely into examples that worked with actual GUI design a few weeks later.   In fact you can see the germ of that in the Swing example I posted in the way I use three parallel arrays to manage the xy and color components of a Dot.,2019-11-13T16:56:56.237,4799
15862,6042,0,Managing the correct state of an entity all at once and abstraction of the necessary implementation details to reveal only the behavioral interface is the core insight of object-oriented design.  I found that student were able to transition from what you see here to that insight very easily.,2019-11-13T16:57:00.257,4799
15863,6049,0,_@JohnnyApplesauce -  It depends how much you want to stretch you students' brain. C is close enough to other languages to be of little comparable (to Forth) interest. You can ignore ASM to understand Forth student just to have understand the RAM memory and stack (no ASM commands are necessary). And Forth has interactive commandline interpreter very easy (and fun) to poke around.,2019-11-13T22:17:13.087,1480
15864,4425,0,KiB = 1024 Bytes > KB = 1000 Bytes > Kib = 1024 bits > Kb = 1000 bits,2019-11-13T23:42:12.957,8611
15865,6031,0,Thank you so much! This is what I needed and well beyond. I haven't done it yet but I will update once I do.,2019-11-14T21:32:30.447,5614
15866,6051,0,What is your purpose in considering it? In fact nearly everything is available somewhere but people still write. Your last sentence talks about value. Value to whom?,2019-11-15T21:37:26.717,1293
15867,6051,0,I would like to create a community of inexperienced developers(with < 2 years of experience) so I can offer them mentorship. I know how much I needed some seniors when I had no experience to give me guidance and explain things that I couldn't understand alone. For example I can tell them to read about SOLID principles or design patterns and then if they don't understand clearly I can help them. But before I offer them mentorship I must prove somehow that I am a good choice for them. I think writing tutorials is a good way. Also in a few topics I can write really advanced tutorials.,2019-11-15T21:44:35.767,8615
15868,6051,0,Are you also one of the inexperienced ones? Or a teacher? Mentor?,2019-11-15T21:54:14.860,1293
15869,6051,0,I have 4 years of good experience I would like to become a mentor. I was mentoring a few colleagues at work and I think that they learned a lot from me.,2019-11-15T21:56:28.623,8615
15870,6053,0,Could you provide links to such Arduino videos preferably ones that have source-code attached?,2019-11-16T23:17:02.100,8043
15871,6053,0,_@JohnnyApplesauce [here's](https://makezine.com/2016/08/31/dog-simple-arduino-controlled-plant-watering/) Make's description of how such a project could work with a link to the source code and an instructable. No video but pictures. I'd suggest googling 'cool arduino projects' or 'cool [technology] projects' and it'll give you stuff you're looking for.,2019-11-17T00:45:00.727,919
15872,6056,0,If the thing being learned is coding and the project is complete and working. Feedback on sections of it could be received by posting on [codereview.se]. Just follow their rules for what/how to post.,2019-11-18T23:41:12.510,104
15883,5531,1,_@MichelBillaud given the source I suspect it's clumsy linked-list *Visual Basic* code badly ported to Python.,2019-11-25T08:10:49.650,1219
15884,5531,0,_@PeterTaylor To me it is written in a Instructions as State Transformer style as the array and top/free list pointers are passed as parameters AND returned instead of being encapsulated into an object. Also the original stack array is modified during the process so it is not really functional style with immutable object. The question is: what point is this code supposed to support?,2019-11-25T09:43:28.613,2103
15885,5532,0,_@Buffy Actually the Push method modifies the content of the Stack array given as a parameter.,2019-11-25T09:47:23.637,2103
15886,6062,0,What do you think? is an open-ended vague question that leads to opinion-based answers. In its current state I expect the question will be closed. Please ask a concrete question rather than fishing for opinions.,2019-11-25T11:40:09.017,2164
15887,5532,0,_@MichelBillaud Conceptually the stack is new since it is returned from push. There is a mismatch between the interface protocols and the implementation. Nothing in the interface guarantees the stack returned is the same as the argument. Another flaw in the code actually.,2019-11-25T11:40:17.157,1293
15888,6062,0,Hi Andrey welcome to [cseducators.se]! What you are doing (developing lessons) is laudable but please understand that advertising is not the purpose of this site. There is no meaningful question here so I am forced to close it. If you do have pedagogic questions in the future of course this site will always be open to advise you on any issues you encounter.  Best of luck with your business!,2019-11-25T11:42:03.083,27
15889,6063,0,Thank you for posting this!,2019-11-26T17:54:15.603,27
15890,904,0,Thank you for a hard laugh!,2019-11-29T03:31:52.653,765
15891,6073,8,At that age they're sponges. It'll give them problem solving skills early plus the gratification of creating something that they can enjoy in a relatively short time.,2019-11-29T07:56:19.203,1446
15892,6073,4,I don't think there's much point. It's like trying to teach everyone to be a concert pianist or car mechanic at that age. But we have this 'everyone must be a coder' mindset at the minute whereby what we really need is a 'everyone must be computer literate and know how to be safe online' mindset.,2019-11-29T12:27:38.223,8659
15893,6074,0,Could you please elaborate pattern of thoughts a little bit more?,2019-11-29T14:10:35.293,8654
15894,6074,1,_@gpuguy that is pretty hard to do a little bit. It would take a long answer (maybe to a suitable question). But the ways of thought in mathematics are different from those of pure science and both of those are different from literature. I used to like Apple Computer's catch phrase Think Different. More generally analysis and synthesis are different modes of thought. There are a lot of possibilities. The more angles you have to attack a problem the more likely you will be able to come to a solution.,2019-11-29T14:15:11.393,1293
15895,6073,4,How is coding different from anything else that you teach a child? In all cases they're only going to apply it in a professional context at least a decade down the line.,2019-11-29T15:49:32.247,2164
15896,6073,2,_@AlanB: There is more to it than computer literacy. As the world automates itself more and more manual labor jobs are being replaced by automation but higher level jobs (i.e. the ones that work _with_ automation) are opening up. A simple example would be to highlight the disappearance of production line worker jobs with a simultaneous increase in production line robot mechanics and (by extension programmers). Coding is an exercise in analytics (not too dissimilar from what math already teaches) which provides a base layer for these employment sectors.,2019-11-29T15:56:33.440,2164
15897,6080,1,Hi Evans! Welcome to [cseducators.se]! This question isn't the sort that we're able to answer since it doesn't seem to be about teaching CS (it seems like some kind of homework question). I've closed it for now but feel free to correct me if you think I've misunderstood what you're asking.,2019-11-29T16:15:04.803,58
15898,6080,1,This seems to be an assignment. You should do it yourself. In any case this is not the place to ask.,2019-11-29T16:15:20.657,1293
15899,6073,4,What's the point in teaching kids music if they [usually] can't become a concert pianist until at least a decade later?,2019-11-29T16:19:31.053,4731
15900,6073,0,Music = computer literacy & online safey concert pianist = software development broadly.,2019-11-29T16:24:08.760,8659
15901,6074,0,CSunplug is quite interesting! Thanks for sharing.,2019-11-29T23:40:44.400,8654
15902,6073,0,_@LightnessRaceswithMonica the real question is why teach kids music if 99.9% of them won't ever become a professional musician...,2019-11-30T00:52:13.620,8664
15903,6073,0,_@JonathanReezSupportsMonica Basically the same question. Answer: who gives a ##### who becomes a professional musician?,2019-11-30T01:47:32.440,4731
15904,6073,0,_@LightnessRaceswithMonica its a different question as ~90% of future employees will deal with some forms of software in their work quite unlike music,2019-11-30T02:26:15.190,8664
15905,6073,0,In the case of Australia in the end the answer is ultimately because it's on the National Curriculum. Not sure if that counts as an Answer though.,2019-11-30T08:02:06.793,7971
15906,6040,0,A Python program that is just misspelled Java isn't really a Python program. It isn't pythonic in the jargon. On the other hand you'll have people taking an attitude of if it works don't fix it. You might have a few students who produce actually pythonic programming but most of them probably won't. A decent chunk probably won't produce anything functional at all because they don't plan to become programmers and they don't care about programming. Maybe you'd have better results if it's an elective taken by older students though.,2019-11-30T08:17:43.253,7971
15907,6073,1,_@AlanB Take your car mechanic example. Every professional driver should know how to change a tire how to pressure a tire how to change motor oil refill wiper fluid etc.  Why is this? Because it's economical to be able to do simple maintenance of your work tools yourself. Pretty much every single job *already* uses software and the software part keeps growing so every child is going to be a professional software user in the future and needs to be able to solve the equivalent software tasks. The only real difference is that software is more complicated so it's harder to pick up on the job.,2019-11-30T11:35:05.977,8668
15908,6073,0,_@JonathanReezSupportsMonica And yet despite that we _do_ teach kids music which is exactly the point: it shows that future career prospects and/or using this stuff in a job is _irrelevant_. So no it's not a different question.,2019-11-30T14:49:08.720,4731
15909,6080,0,Even if you move it to the correct sub-site. It is not in the form of a question. It us just an extract from a homework assignment.,2019-11-30T16:27:47.270,204
15910,6066,0,I don't know: What is ID?,2019-11-30T16:28:43.867,204
15911,6062,0,So is the question should we teach one thing well or should we try to dump every thing into the students head all at once?,2019-11-30T16:31:56.220,204
15912,6074,0,Unfortunately Apple should have used an adverb to modify the verb. Think Differently. But maybe it was a command to think about the word different.,2019-11-30T18:30:54.510,8672
15913,6073,0,because some kids might be smarter than you and me and because you can learn a lot of simple concepts from programming that would help you to develop your rational thinking and teach you to make sense of a complex process by analyzing it step by step,2019-11-30T19:18:16.227,8111
15914,6073,0,_@LightnessRaceswithMonica at the very least it's a different answer because teaching software can be justified with the kid will use it at work in one way or another. Teaching music doesn't have a practical justification it's just something that people do for entertainment.,2019-11-30T19:28:51.907,8664
15915,6073,0,_@JonathanReezSupportsMonica You are so way off the mark,2019-11-30T23:41:53.387,4731
