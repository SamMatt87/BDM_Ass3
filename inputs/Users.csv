Interested in supporting computing activities in schools.<br> All posts are my own opinions and do not reflect the views of my employer.</p>  <p>I'm available in a volunteering capacity to support education events around the Cambridge area provided these are STEM focused and involve specific technical activities or relate to 'typical careers and working conditions' in engineering and technology.</p>  <p>I'm thinking about writing a series of blog posts centred around the 'Performing Engineering Operations Level 2' NVQ qualification. There doesn't seem to be much good source material the teaching (of assessed knowledge) is poor and the questions asked for assessment have no real answers at all.</p>  <p>I'm also desperate to drag the pre-university teaching of electronics and computing way from 1970's hardware examples. I see students today learning with NE555 and 7805 - these components are as old as me and are much less likely to be the correct choice. There are questions about pre-forming components - components are in the main now designed for automated pick-and-place not wire-wrap and hand assembly.</p> ,38,417,28,977188,

I completed my PhD at Wesleyan University in 2014 under the supervision of Mark Hovey and I completed a masters degree in computer science under the supervision of Danny Krizanc. I'm mostly interested in questions involving (semi) model categories Bousfield localization and algebras over (colored) operads. I like to apply my work to unstable stable equivariant and motivic homotopy theory to homological algebra and to representation theory. On the computer science side I like thinking about graph theory probability and social networks with an eye towards algorithms. I've also begun to dabble in game theory economics and statistics thanks to my teaching.</p> ,23,54,11,2947683,https://i.stack.imgur.com/4DroS.png?s=128&g=1

If Linux is so superior then why can't it (or at least most of the main utilities for Linux) handle even the most basic crap like a CRLF? Why don't people make many good video games for it?

I most recently ended a stint as a Lead Instructor of Full Stack Web Development @ Flatiron School. The tech stack I taught was Ruby Active Record Ruby on Rails JavaScript React and Redux. It was a great way to bridge my love of tech with the joy of teaching and while it was great fun I pine for the days of learning new technology stacks and writing code.</p>  <p>I'm now looking to move to the West Coast with my family in the next step of my personal journey.

I have instead decided to do the more difficult task of creating my own <strong>useful</strong> operating system.  I enjoy being challenged in my job and I am happiest when working on a project with ambitious goals.  I am continually trying to learn new things; either by continuing my formal education (currently working towards my Ph.D.) reading or better yet just trying something new.</p>  <p>I enjoy low level programming: kernels systems programming robotics etc. I prefer C or assembly but I can do C++ and if I have to make a GUI application C#. I am familiar with both Linux and Windows userspace and kernel development. I enjoy being challenged especially when it comes to interacting with hardware. I find only a few things more satisfying than getting that one bit correct which makes the entire thing run because the hardware says that bit has to be that way. Don't get me wrong its maddening up to the point when you fix it and you start to try to convince yourself that the hardware is broken and a few rare times it is but getting it to finally work is extremely satisfying.</p>  <p>I am currently a Hypervisor Engineer at Barkly Protects Inc. and am working on finishing my PhD.</p> ,0,2,0,1760603,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cf6963d2f289cbf78d9c0ece6920188?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG

949,326,2017-06-18T16:25:17.370,James McLeod,2019-11-30T16:07:48.990,,Toronto Canada,<p>My background is in math (BMath; Waterloo) and civil engineering (BASc MASc; Toronto). As I learned to dislike statistics when I was studying math fate provided me with the opportunity to do a master's thesis on applying good old-fashioned statistics to hydrology with the goal of finding improved methods of estimating underlying distributions from small samples. Fortunately this relied heavily on Monte Carlo simulation and I was able to convince myself that it was based on software instead of statistics. I somehow ended up as a software developer working on real time control systems and ancillary applications for the broadcast industry for fifteen years and now work as a project manager for the development of call center software.</p> ,2,2,0,95329,

It?€?s our  job as creators to design and build easy efficient and satisfying  experiences. People trying in good faith shouldn?€?t feel bad about  technology we must evolve and improve.</p>  <p>A different saying is ?€?the customer is always right?€? it?€?s usually not  meant literally more to convey an ethos. Similarly we can  believe ?€?the customer is always capable?€?. If they ever don?€?t have  a good experience we can keep iterating and innovating and find  a way to make our offerings succeed for more and more people.</p> ,0,0,0,359045,https://i.stack.imgur.com/jYx9d.jpg?s=128&g=1

My Obama number is 2!</p>  <p>If I see further than most it is because I have stood on the toes of giants and they kicked me high into the air...</p>  <p>However there is nothing to suggest that I see further than most.</p>  <p>I am (inasmuch as one 'is' an occupation) an engineer. My mathematical skills are rather pedestrian with a rare insight every now and then. I have been lucky enough to sit in the same room with some famous mathematicians &amp; engineers. My Erd??s number is 5 which undoubtedly makes me as unique as an Irishman in a pub. And I have been spotted in The Pub from time to time.</p>  <p>In professional circumstances my value add has usually been the injection of common sense and completion of grunt work when perspectives and energies are unfocused. </p>  <p>My current age is the largest prime less than the number of atoms in Buckminsterfullerene.</p>  <p>My real name is Joe Higgins. Apparently my last name means 'of the Viking' in Irish. </p>  <p>My alma mater is University College Cork in Ireland and I had the additional privilege of obtaining my Phd. in EECS from the University of California at Berkeley under the enlightened tutelage of Lucien Polak.</p>  <p>I can be reached at joe dot higgins at gmail dot com.</p>  <p>The little picture is of my tent at Lake Helen on the beautiful Mount Shasta in August 2009. Unfortunately I had to turn back near the peak this time (on the appropriately named Misery Hill) because of a lightning storm which dumped some unexpected snow. The nearby lightning caused my ice axe to hum and a strange bee-like buzzing sound in my hair! Very entertaining.</p>  <p>Feynman used to say physics is to sex as mathematics is to masturbation.</p>  <p>To cheer you up AE Housman wrote that      Perfect understanding will sometimes almost extinguish pleasure.</p>  <p>I like Rockafellar's line: This classical result is an outstanding example of a fact which is completely obvious to geometric intuition but which wields important algebraic content and is not trivial to prove.

I'm Luke a freelancing software developer who simply loves building things. Over the years I have been involved in a wide range of projects with experience in websites big data gaming graphics finance warehouses real time systems and more. As a result some of my software can be found <em>(somewhat unexpectedly!)</em> in A320 cockpits too.</p>  <p>I am particularly interested in web technologies and know them rather literally inside out <em>(at far too much detail!)</em> as well as occasionally contributing to their development as a part of the wonderfully vibrant open source community. For a few years I have been working on PowerUI - a tool that thousands of developers use to make user interfaces for games using web technologies - and it's gradually becoming a full web browser. It has been particularly fascinating to see the diversity of projects that make use of PowerUI and it has always been a pleasure to help and contribute to them whenever I can.</p> ,0,0,0,3428879,https://i.stack.imgur.com/g89TG.jpg?s=128&g=1

It's an expression of the mastery that one has in a language and an art form in itself.</p>  <p>When I'm not coding I'm probably playing video games (TF2 is love TF2 is life) writing reading or (<em>gasp</em>) socializing within what semblance of a social life I have.</p>  <p>About <em>me</em> I'm a Christian teenager proud to be serving my God.

I know a few languages but <strong>Javascript</strong> is where I spend most of my time. I'm a single dad full time programmer and run a small business on the side.</p>  <h2>About Stack Exchange</h2>  <p>Stack Exchange is a wonderful resource. I've learned a lot from the community here over the years and I like to give back and try to answer questions when I can - but in my opinion the model is inherently flawed. </p>  <p>Moderation tools are assigned to users as they gain reputation points. The problem is you can be an expert on some programming language and earn 20k or 100k rep but that does not mean you will be a good moderator. For this reason Stack Exchange is very inconsistent in quality. Depending on who is online when you ask a question it may be well received or some opinionated high-rep user may unilaterally close it for any number of reasons. The day and time that you choose to ask a question is just as important as the question itself. </p>  <p>Thank you to those of you who have answered my questions and been helpful to the community and thank you to the high-rep users who aren't here on a power trip. You da real mvp.</p> ,12,0,0,1552547,https://i.stack.imgur.com/jwcQb.jpg?s=128&g=1

The next week he returned with the printout of a 49x49 magic square - and so a passion was born.  Spending more time on physics.SE these days.

When I think issues that I've pointed out have been adequately addressed I generally delete my comments so it looks like the conversation never took place.</p>  <p>I believe this is how most criticisms should happen on the site. Just fix the problem and move on.</p> ,0,0,0,3452279,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9df9d7af70d46f8db2ecd4392bb76087?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1

After I took an app programming course in 2014 I spent the summer learning Android and published an app which I continued to work on for another year. In 2015 I took a position at a cloud research group on campus got into cloud services and Docker and wrote a few Node and Django backends. After graduating in 2016 I worked for a year at a startup in San Antonio where I worked on different projects including their Java and Android SDKs. As of August 2018 I'm looking to move to Austin.</p> ,0,0,0,6633972,https://i.stack.imgur.com/UxKig.jpg?s=128&g=1

I give more details <a href=https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1655/45112>here</a>. The high-level reason is over the course of the last two years it has become completely apparent that Stack Exchange no longer sees its community as a partner. That means Stack Exchange is simply an exploiter of that community and worse one that it treats with contempt.</p>  <p>It is commonly pointed out that contributions help people other than Stack Exchange too. I agree and contributions in other venues and on other platforms will help people too. At this point I don't think <em>anyone</em> should be contributing to Stack Exchange. If people arrive here with good questions and fail to get answers they will simply move on to alternative platforms which is exactly what I'd want them to do.</p>  <p>It is possible for Stack Exchange to regain most of the trust lost but that process is one of years from when they start the process if they ever do. By that point however I will have quite thoroughly moved on.</p> ,2,2,0,7652543,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0cab3b0361b7e54267c70c02754f21de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1

Every one of the kids of my Great-Gramps ended up in IT sooner or later with several of their sons and daughters also joining the IT fray in one form or another. My grandfather was the one that inspired me to join software development and taught me how to develop systems for DBASE III when I was really little and since them I've been doing software both as a hobby and as a job. </p>  <p>I went trough college for Computer Science and started working on the field as an intern on the same semester I hit college doing a lot of advanced math work that honestly shouldn't have been given to an intern. I learned that college wouldn't really prepare me better than real-life experiences on the my field so I started learning every single thing I could for everyone I worked with - my peers my bosses colleagues from different departments... I found out that I love to learn stuff and I strive to learn at least one new thing every day.</p>  <p>I also have around 10 years of Dungeon Mastering experience - mostly with d20 systems especially D&amp;D 3.X and Pathfinder. </p>  <p>Currently I'm running a Shadowrun game every other week using mostly skype to conduct my games. </p>  <p>I'm also a long time gamer and World of Wacraft/Starbound player.</p> ,0,0,0,3053195,https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUKmO.png?s=128&g=1

As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html rel=nofollow noreferrer>Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I?€?ve studied Spanish French Italian Portuguese Latin and German along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>  <p>The maxim that <em>?€?If you haven?€?t lost track of how many languages you?€?ve learned you haven?€?t learned enough of them yet?€?</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p> ,0,4,0,216196,https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSlyx.gif?s=128&g=1

Poirier currently works as a software developer at OIFII.ORG and he is also OIFII.ORG?€?s founder. At OIFII.ORG Voronoi diagrams are used for individual tree level forest texture recognition out of airborne Lidar data in order to automate the process of building new forest maps for governments. In 2017 Poirier had the idea to use these Voronoi diagrams combined with a specific algorithm to produce semi-abstract art called Vorotrans art.</p>  <p>For the years to come Vorotrans art installations are now made available to art galleries around the world.</p>  <p>Poirier has held many research positions at Laval University University of Alberta University of British Columbia University of Masssachusetts in Boston Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Sherbrooke and McGill University. Over the years Poirier has also held many corporate positions in Quebec and California.

I'm a big fan of service oriented architecture and find my niche to be in the middle to backend layers of n-tier software. I like to play with Arduinos and mobile development in my free time when I'm not playing music. </p>  <p>Musically I grew up in a family of musicians primarily influenced by my father (a classically trained jazz bassist). My first instrument I took seriously was the ocarina starting when I was 5. I picked up bass when I was 8 violin at 10 guitar and bass (upright and electric) at 12. Since then I've noodled with a lot of stuff and have a solid foundation of music theory. Favorite artists include: Return to Forever Charles Mingus Horace Silver The Roots Tom Waits anything Jack White Opeth Billy Faier and Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. The only genre I have a hard time listening to is Modern Country after the 90s.</p> ,0,0,0,11125086,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4a57e3772b5662ae28f79fcdedb4fe3c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1

The sand was soft the ocean glass But I was still just me.  Then pelicans in threes and fours Glided by like dinosaurs An otter basked upon its back And dived to find another snack.  The sun corpuscular and bright Cast down a piercing shaft And conjured an inspiring sight On glinting bobbing craft.  Two mermaids rose up from the reef Out of the breaking waves. Their siren song was opium grief Their faces from the grave.  The mermaids asked a princely kiss To free them from their spell. I said to try a poet?€?s bliss. They shrugged and bid farewell.  The sun grew dark and sinister In unscheduled eclipse. As two eight-headed aliens Descended in their ships.  They said the World was nice enough But didn?€?t like our star. And asked the way to Betelgeuse If it wouldn?€?t be too far.  Two whales breached far out to sea And flew up to the sky The crowd was busy frolicking And didn?€?t ask me why.  Today I left my phone at home On the worst day you?€?ll agree. If only I had pictures If only you could see.  Not everything was really there I?€?m happy to confess But I still have the memories Worth more than tweets and stress.  Today I left my phone at home I had no shakes or sorrow. If that is what my mind can do It stays at home tomorrow.  Gavin Miller </code></pre> ,0,77,0,403854,https://i.stack.imgur.com/2DTBv.jpg?s=128&g=1

I'm seeking hands-on experience through internships or work during the summer.</p>  <p>Programming with Java gives me a sense of achievement and power - I possess the ability to build what I want. Starting from the first time I wrote a line of code to output Hello World to the screen programming has been my passion and is what I would love to devote my life to.</p>  <p>Other than programming I enjoy taking walks outside with family playing chess and participating in extracurricular activities at school. I also enjoy going out with friends and having a good time.</p>  <p>I love learning and using new knowledge to produce something useful &amp; fun for me and those around me. I love spreading my passion for computer science to others and have experience teaching kids coding and how to take what they learn and apply it to something that matters to them. An organization?€?s ability to learn and translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive advantage. ?€?

He spent too many years writing software <em>just</em> for fun on the side while working retail to pay the bills. </p>  <p>Martin picked up professional experience working as a private contractor for Nocturnal Entertainment Australia on the Game Boy Advance title Ultimate Arcade Games. With a shiped title under his belt he attempted to move into a full time position in the industry but ultimately fell short.  Disappointed Martin decided to return to school to flesh out his skill set. In the process he discovered he enjoyed the problem solving and design of complex systems more than the game development. He graduated at(or nearly so) the top of his class at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in Computer Engineering. </p>  <p>Today he works on the Enterprise Management Technologies team at Quad/Graphics.</p>  <h1>SOreadytohelp</h1> ,0,5,0,167083,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9051bf8057ffcd22c3988ed052431f26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG

As a result most German native speakers can't hear the difference between <em>belief</em> and <em>believe</em> between <em>advice</em> and <em>advise</em> or between <em>effect</em> and <em>affect</em>.</p>  <p>My Android App trains the ability to hear the difference between different phonemes by giving the learner deliberate feedback. This allows the learner to regain the ability to distinguish phonemes that they lost as a child.</p>  <p>While some people think that the way to improve information flow is through building brain-computer interfaces that can magically push information into brains I think it makes sense to do our best to optimize the information flow of our existing channels.</p>  <p>After school I went to study bioinformatics because I thought the way to improve the human brain is through looking at neurons. Today I think improving the human brain is more about finding the right kind of stimulus. The human brain is an amazing learning machine on it's own and we don't need to put any electrodes into it to train it to do better. </p> ,0,4,0,12757,https://i.stack.imgur.com/9hShk.jpg

Please try to follow them it helps the flow when reading and it helps when trying to understand exactly what you are talking about. The official guidelines are offered in chapter 5 of the <a href=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf rel=nofollow noreferrer>SI brochure</a> but there is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Unit_symbols_and_the_values_of_quantities rel=nofollow noreferrer>summary</a> with a couple of examples on Wikipedia.</p>  <p>A particular problem is the <em>space</em> between the value and the unit for example: 12&#8239;V not 12V. A common hack is to use the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space rel=nofollow noreferrer>non-breaking space</a> <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> to prevent the browser wrapping the line between the value and the unit. The problem with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is that it is often interpreted as a <em>fixed width</em> space meaning that it will not render as the same width as a normal space but wider. Unicode has solved this problem by introducing the <code>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</code> symbol <code>&amp;#8239;</code>.</p>  <p>My recommendation is that you use <code>&amp;#8239;</code> to format SI units. This difference may or may not be visible in your browser:</p>  <ul> <li>12 V (normal space)</li> <li>12&nbsp;V (&amp;nbsp;)</li> <li>12&#8239;V (&amp;#8239;)</li> </ul>  <h2><em>I'm in Europe.</em></h2>  <p>This means <em>nothing</em>. Nothing at all to anyone trying to help you with a question you might have. Either write your <em>country</em> or just leave it out - There's a world of difference (literally) between Turkey Switzerland Portugal Romania United Kingdom and Iceland. Different laws different business structures different traditions different standards. The same goes for Asia.</p>  <p>Leaving out your country means that you will not get help with questions such as:</p>  <ul> <li>Is this legal?</li> <li>Where can I buy things?</li> </ul> ,3,9,0,7306058,https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKaUq.png?s=128&g=1

I started development professionally during last semesters for the final year students of our and other universities. I am always happy to be to be assigned challenging tasks. My core has been Php and Node.js development with MYSQL and MVC plus client side scripting in JS and JQuery. But I have worked in various languages and various tool-sets whenever needed I learned and applied. My preferred approach for web development is now with ANGULAR-JS for well structured really object oriented all around even in UI views and along with that loosely coupled apps development.</p> ,0,0,0,6544431,https://graph.facebook.com/1458084244511022/picture?type=large

I've used LaTeX since 1991 ever since I wrote a couple of working papers with an early version of LaTeX. I continue to use LaTeX for my own working papers journal articles and some of my other professional publications. </p>  <p>I am the principal author of the <a href=http://ctan.org/pkg/selnolig rel=nofollow noreferrer>selnolig package</a> which lets users automatically suppress typographic ligatures that are inappropriate because they span morpheme boundaries for both English and German language texts.</p>  <p>I once edited an entire conference proceedings volume in LaTeX. This was a fabulous learning experience especially as I got to work closely with a professional book designer from a very early stage of the editing and publication process. For another organization I used to work for I wrote a LaTeX package to implement the style and layout requirements the organization had chosen to impose on working papers written by its professional staff (mostly its economists). This package (i) helped free up much of the authors' time that would otherwise have been wasted on figuring out how to implement the organization's stylistic requirements in LaTeX -- the guidelines had been written (unsurprisingly...) primarily for users of MS Word -- and (ii) actually convinced some of the organization's economists to make the switch from MS Word to LaTeX in order to write their working papers more efficiently.</p>  <hr>  <p><a href=http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1436/5001>Welcome to TeX.SE!</a></p>  <p>[I've just been asked to write a minimal example.

Feynman</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>Examples don't only improve understanding they help validate it:</p>  <blockquote>   <h2>It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment it's wrong.</h2>      <p>Richard P. Feynman</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>I'm an ignorant teen. Not to worry for I'm a curious teen as well!</p>  <blockquote>   <h2>It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined permanently blocked as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.</h2>      <p>Richard P. Feynman</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>If your still on first principles like I am don't feel too bad.</p>  <blockquote>   <h2>If you keep proving stuff that others have done getting confidence increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one!</h2>      <p>Richard P. Feynman</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>You haven't lived if you can't relate to this quote:</p>  <blockquote>   <h2>If I get stuck I look at a book that tells me how someone else did it. I turn the pages and then I say 'Oh I forgot that bit' then close the book and carry on. Finally after you've figured out how to do it you read how they did it and find out how dumb your solution is and how much more clever and efficient theirs is!</h2>      <p>Richard P. Feynman</p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>I study like this too:</p>  <blockquote>   <h2>It's the way I study - to understand something by trying to work it out or in other words to understand something by creating it. Not creating it one hundred percent of course; but taking a hint as to which direction to go but not remembering the details. These you work out for yourself.</h2>      <p>Richard P.

4538,101,2018-03-12T02:43:47.127,Justin,2019-09-16T00:01:30.633,,United States,<p>Life should be fun! Make it so. I program not so much for the end goal but because programming itself is fun. Why? Well</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It's the inefficiencies in life that make it worth living.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Programming itself isn't efficient although it is about making things more efficient. The most enjoyable kind of programming is the highly inefficient high brainpower challenging work that improves future efficiency. And for life to be worth living I find challenge to be paramount. </p>  <p>Learning new languages. Understanding new libraries. Grokking C++'s template metaprogramming. Rust's borrow checker. Concurrent programming. Even clean simple Java 8's streams and lambdas. Or bigger: designing the classes of your project. Attempting to simplify the inevitable refactoring due to design errors. Frustration at limitations of your language. These all have something in common for me: they require brainpower. It's inefficient to do these things. I could just go in and code. Granted that would rapidly devolve into inefficient tar but that doesn't mean it would be inefficient at the time. It's these challenges these inefficiencies that make life worth living.</p>  <p>One of my mentors once said</p>  <blockquote>   <p>It's good to be lazy <em>if</em> it is the right kind of lazy. -- D.A.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I've followed this mentality my whole life. While taking Calculus I constantly pondered over its rules and quirks. I constantly searched for shortcuts that would make coursework faster. I constantly analyzed the mathematics to try to make sense of it. Consequently it made so much sense to me. Integration by Parts became easy once I tried to integrate without it and derived it via the Product Rule. Volumes of solids of revolution became easy when I saw that variables were just labels. It didn't matter if I graphed the x axis as the vertical one.</p>  <p>And in programming it is definitely good to be lazy. Yet sometimes the laziness never effects increased efficiency in the project I wanted to be lazy with. Sometimes these are only learning experiences which help me become a better developer in the future. And I need it to be enjoyable. As it should be.</p>  <p>As Linus Torvalds said</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public but because it is fun to program.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I would go further:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Life needs to be fun. Whatever you do you should do not because you expect to get paid not because you want the approval of others but because you find it fulfilling. You find it enjoyable. Your life is for you not for me but for <em>you</em>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Perhaps your job isn't enjoyable but you do it so you can enjoy your free time; that is fine. Perhaps you aren't finding anything enjoyable whatsoever but you are doing what you know you <em>should</em> find fun. That is also fine. Just remember that life is short; this flash of color will be gone in the blink of an eye. Life is for living. Ensure that you actually are living it not just surviving.</p> ,1,0,0,2136544,https://i.stack.imgur.com/jap8U.png?s=128&g=1

Under the hood when you make a member call to <code>DoSomething</code> against a <code>Class1</code> object the call goes essentially like this:</p>  <pre><code>Set obj = New Class1 Class1.DoSomething obj </code></pre>  <p>This means <code>DoSomething</code> looks like this in VBA:</p>  <pre><code>Public Sub DoSomething() End Sub </code></pre>  <p>But VBA sees it like this:</p>  <pre><code>Public Sub DoSomething(ByVal Me As Class1) End Sub </code></pre>  <p>That makes <code>Me</code> an implicit locally-scoped <code>ByVal</code> parameter of type <code>Class1</code> and inside the <code>DoSomething</code> scope it holds a reference to whatever object <em>the caller</em> is currently using.</p>  <hr>  <p><a href=https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators>Moderator</a> on Code Review Stack Exchange 2015-2018 2019-<br> <a href=https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002943 rel=nofollow noreferrer>Microsoft MVP</a> (Office Apps &amp; Services) 2018-</p>  <p><img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKwQD.png alt=Rubberduck><br> <a href=http://rubberduckvba.com rel=nofollow noreferrer>rubberduckvba.com</a> | <a href=https://twitter.com/rubberduckvba rel=nofollow noreferrer>twitter</a> | <a href=https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck rel=nofollow noreferrer>github</a> | <a href=https://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow noreferrer>wordpress</a></p> ,1,2,0,1222063,https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNdZG.jpg?s=128&g=1

I have learned the process from an empty visual c++ project. The video tutorials I have followed did not supply any source code everything had to be manually typed and debugged. I have learned how to set up OpenGL and OpenAL for windows application. It took about 2 years and is a large scale project. We implemented 3 static libraries. A mathLib objectLib and sceneLib on top of the main project. We had an ErrorHandler class UserSettings class a ColorOGL class and a GameOGL class and a few classes for AudioObject within the main project. In the mathLib we had a couple of Vector classes a Plane class Integrator classes Interpolate class and a GeneralMath class for most of the vector and physics calculations. The physics engine was small and basic with simple collision detection simple AI and animation. The objectLib contained a few derived Geometry classes a class for our items and characters in the game and a handfull of classes to import object or scene files from Caligari's trueSpace. It also contained all the objects for our custom GUIClasses which includes button radio list image and sliders. The sceneLib contained classes for player camera material textures textureTransforms fonts lights( point spot and directional) and node classes for our sceneGraph along with our Scene class which brought all of these elements together. We also wrote our own parser so that any of our objects textures materials etc could be changed from a text file (*.lvl) and run the program without having to rebuild the app just to change a few parameters. To make the code writing process easier we implemented three manager classes one for our Textures which also handles our founts one to handle all of our GUI classes and one for our Sound. We also have a HUD and a Console implemented as well. We covered networking in a different series but it was not included or integrated into the overall gameEngine. With all of this we took the gameEngine refined it a little then built a playable 3D first person shooter game. The newest set of material that is being covered right now is doing a Series on Shaders using OpenGL.

Considered reflecting an introvert with a high capacity for curiosity to learn through all situations. The motivation of curiosity is based on a foundation set in the Truth that has kept me in a position of integrity both in thought and actions. My life is based on hope not living for the things of this world but living for others to bring them some insight after consistently doing things that fulfill my need to know. I have a passion for everything related to printed circuit boards and have since AOL at the age of 19. I have worked in various fields of this platform from building circuit boards to Tech Support for Hewlett Packard. I recently injured my hand and became unable to work.

Since joining I have been working on the design and prototype of an enhanced smart contract system with a functional programming attitude.</p>  <p>Before becoming a programmer I was a mathematician for a long time. I received my PhD from Harvard in geometric representation theory with Dennis Gaitsgory as my advisor. Afterward I was a postdoc at the University of Michigan ending in May 2015 when I left academia and became a programmer. Although I'm fairly highly educated in category theory which you might think is related to my interest in Haskell in fact I don't use the connection very much in practice. The language is simply beautiful in its own right.</p>  <p>In academia my only programming experience was with the macro/functional/awful language TeX for which I wrote a few small packages most notably ytabeau and the unpublished trace-pgfkeys (available on my website).

Often the problem is in a mistaken expectation of what should happen or a mistaken interpretation of what did happen.</p>  <p>In order to help them one has to make assumptions and guess at these things and the guesses may be off-target resulting in an annoying waste of time for both sides.</p>  <p>It's like Nebuchadnezzar asking for an interpretation of his dream but <a href=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%202%3A1-11&amp;version=ESV rel=nofollow>refusing to reveal the dream itself</a>.

Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! &gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre> ,1,5,0,1859160,https://i.stack.imgur.com/0FAIV.jpg?s=128&g=1

I cannot get that out of my mind. It's just too exciting. Call it whatever you want - a simulation a divine right of passage on to something else the matrix a metaphysical drama - the reality is that there seem to be puzzles. Puzzles that if understood (as proven by experiment) promise the re-shaping reality. This could be as simple as cooking a steak according to a new recipe and tasting the results. Steaks now taste better (hopefully!) or they don't and you move on. </p>  <p>It doesn't matter if we:</p>  <ul> <li>Terraform Mars</li> <li>Automate [insert thing]</li> <li>Create general AI</li> <li>Cure death</li> </ul>  <p>If we continue to:</p>  <ul> <li>Believe these things will happen automatically - how many people are <em>really</em> working on the above? </li> <li>Value tools and memorization over understanding and derivation - see any software engineer job posting; how public ed teaches STEM</li> <li>Deny systemic thinking - grow at all costs; worry about what definition of growth is valid and the consequences later </li> <li>Eschew fields waves and probabilities - immigration is bad or it is good I am right and you are wrong and tiny little balls called electrons orbit the nucleus like a teeny solar system (how convenient!)</li> <li>Pretend like this thinking hasn't permeated the minds of our scientists and engineers*</li> </ul>  <p>I wanted to make things - great - so does most every other engineer. There is likely no stopping the rate of technological progress - but that's not necessarily a good thing. Technology has arguably supplanted government and even family members as the largest shaper of individual realities. If few people are even equipped to <em>begin</em> understanding and contributing to tech the natural consequence is that few will control the tech. That's a recipe for a new-age feudal system. No thanks. </p>  <p>Luckily many projects are open-source so we have a solution to access (it just needs to scale more). The worrisome thing is the ability to <em>contribute</em> is diminished and will follow the trajectory set by our incompetent traditional educational system. This is not taking into account the on-tap distractions and advertisements that are scientifically designed to keep you coming back for more just like a slot machine. There is a war on focus and focus is the resource of innovation. </p>  <p>schoolofstem.com is my humble beginning to attempting to contribute to a solution. </p>  <p>*Sean Carrol a physicist at Caltech posits that a large number of his colleagues - world-class physicists and scientists - do not care about the why only the <a href=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/23/physicists-should-stop-saying-silly-things-about-philosophy/ rel=nofollow noreferrer title=how>how</a>.

I have worked as a full stack developer consultant. I specialize in designing and developing successful .NET applications using C# and Web applications using technologies such as Angular TypeScript ASP.NET MVC/Web API &amp; Azure Cloud.</p>  <p>Over the last few years and in my own time I have been self-teaching myself .NET and C# skills in the area on ASP.NET MVC/Web API &amp; on the other hand Angular for the front-end technology and using the Azure cloud as a cloud platform. I have been blogging my progress and creating Open Source projects to flex my skills. I hope to start learning Xamarin stack and creating apps for the Android IOS &amp; Windows using C# and XAML and hopefully to learn Go lang to work on system programming. I also use my own time to refine my skills and prepare for certification. For example at the moment I'm preparing to take certification on Azure for developers.</p>  <p>Soft Skills:-  I?€?m a very able communicator not just via the written word but I would rather pick up the phone and chat with someone. I?€?m able to know my audience and understand if I can chat techie or not to try and get my point across. I?€?m confident in my abilities to work with our clients to successfully deliver.</p>  <p>I would say I?€?m approachable and well-liked by the people who know me and people whom I work with. Also working within a Scrum environment you need to be able to work closely as a team and form good relationships and self-organize on a daily basis.</p>  <p>I look forward to meeting you!

After that an MSc at Warwick.  I started a PhD also at Warwick but I did not complete it.  The topic was ergodic theory.  Today maths is just a hobby.</p>  <p><strong>Music</strong></p>  <p>I studied music in school and took lessons in the clarinet saxophone and theory of music.  Over many years I have been trying to teach myself the piano.  Progress is slow but I am enjoying it.  I rarely play the clarinet or saxophone any more I don't think that I have enough puff left in my old lungs.  </p>  <p>My musical interest is mostly western classical music but quite wide within that genre: from Bach through Beethoven Stravinsky and many others to Schoenberg.  </p>  <p><strong>Travel</strong></p>  <p>I am a dual UK / Irish citizen currently living in the UK.  I haved lived in Thailand Sri Lanka and the Philippines.  I have travelled extensively in Europe and Asia.  Also North America and Australia but less so.  Never South or Central America and never Africa.  </p>  <p>My travel is sometimes for work and sometimes for pleasure.  Pleasure travel is often low budget.  </p>  <p><strong>Work</strong></p>  <p>Software.  Very occasionally I get to use some of the maths than I learned long ago but not often.  Music never features in work.  I used to travel a lot for work but now just occasionally.  I have little interest in chatting about software outside of work and I don't plan to join any software groups.  </p>  <p><strong>Mental and physical health</strong></p>  <p>I use maths and music to exercise my brain and try to keep it fit.  Similarly I keep physically fit with badminton squash and cycling.</p> ,2,0,0,8278678,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16db5e469e88235f66325ebab2ae1bac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1

I also find assembly enjoyable and often find myself wishing that C was more of abstract portable assembly than it is. But I know my way around a bunch of other programming languages just as you'd expect from a remotely decent programmer.</p>  <p>In a perfect world I'd also write a C-like programming language one day which provided good syntactical support for late-time linking self-modification etc (where the compiler would do its best to optimize for the target machine's instruction caching behavior etc). I think this could be especially powerful for kernel-level optimizations (e.g. a kernel could dynamically generate just the pieces of its file handling code relevant for the usecase a process has in that moment chopping out the unneeded logic - I'm sure smarter people than me with more kernel development experience could think of more better examples) but presently such code has to be written in architecture-specific assembly which keeps it from being viable.</p>  <p>I put my code that I think is useful for others onto my personal GitHub repository even when it's something really tiny and simple. I also try my best to avoid the tendency a lot of people have of saying I'll put my code up when it's cleaned up which in my experience is a great way to end up never getting around to putting your code up for others so I err on the side of open sourcing kludge-y/bad code first regardless of when I get around to cleaning it up.</p>  <p>I am also the kind of person who after writing this thinks: I really should put this text on GitHub so I have one version controlled place for it where I can link people to.</p> ,0,5,0,5504028,https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gdnii.png?s=128&g=1

The software is based on linear and nonlinear model predictive control algorithms which in turn combine algorithms for 1) state estimation and 2) optimal control/dynamic optimization. The software is aimed at a large variety of processes including processes in 1) biotech 2) cement plants 3) oil production and many others.</p>  <p>In 2018 I received a PhD degree in Applied Mathematics with focus on scientific computing from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) where I have previously obtained a MSc in Mathematical Modeling and Computation as well as a BSc in Mathematics and Technology.</p>  <p>During my PhD I worked on computationally efficient algorithms and software for nonlinear model predictive control optimal control/dynamic optimization and state estimation of semi-explicit index-1 DAEs with a focus on phase equilibrium processes e.g. 1) compositional reservoir flow 2) distillation columns and 3) flash separation. It is natural to formulate models of such processes using DAEs in this semi-explicit form.</p> ,0,0,0,10206983,https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9OBv.jpg?s=128&g=1

I'm a self taught full stack web application developer currently living in Bangalore India. I have Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Raipur but my primary focus and interest is Web Development. I am very passionate about Web Development and strive to better myself as a developer.</p>  <p>I have been studying web development since 2014 and I develop in both Java/Spring and Python/Django. I am good at both front and back-end development. But JavaScript makes me cry every time. I'm learning Vue/Nuxt JS as it facilitates two way communication and simple integration.</p>  <p>I fell in love with Python and Django at first glance.</p>  <p>Happy Coding!</p> ,0,0,0,9305162,https://i.stack.imgur.com/QaPIT.jpg?s=128&g=1

My field-of-study is Computer Science. It not only relates topics like Deep Neural Network (DNN) Quantum Computing Quantum Internet Nanotechnology but also Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Technology and Computer-Brain Interface (CBI) Technology. For this I have to simultaneously do research on some of the interrelated Neurological concepts. Moreover I also have to keep an eye on Physiological Psychology to enhance my research arenas for BCI and CBI technology which really helps. But my ongoing research is on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and DNN. Because I personally believe that language is a better medium for interacting with a computer than typing - which is one of the concerns of Graphics User Interfaces (GUIs). I am committed to Making Earth a better place to live.</p> ,0,0,0,14810588,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1db56c624706fac75b9d104121aed04f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1

I ask questions a lot to help me understand programming since I'm very new to it. I also ask questions that seem stupid for other people. But these questions are very serious to me. I'm young and still have a lot to learn in life. I want to be a programmer one day and that's why I'm studying and teaching myself while I'm young. So it would really help if you guys didn't give down votes on my posts since StackOverflow is the only platform that seem really active in programming. I'm not trying to be popular in this platform its just that when I get a negative in overall review in my posts StackOverflow punishes me by not allowing to ask questions and that really hurt my learning process. Help me in my adventure in programming.</p> ,0,0,0,15175951,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pWmynRhWj2w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQNEBkKjAg_QImrxznsjbyvBo12XAQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128

That doesn't mean I'll automatically agree that I was wrong. It just means that I'll be interested in discussing it to find out and I'm not going to get upset at you because I made a mistake and you caught me.</p>  <p>I've been interested in computers since the fourth grade and I've been messing around with programming since the sixth grade. Working out the math that means I've been doing this stuff a long time.</p>  <p>I think differently and I'd like to encourage others to think differently so <a href=https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/121277/neurodiversity?referrer=xC5xMbIB_H-b96kggSoPoA2>I'd like to have an SE where thinking differently is on topic</a> Specifically I am mildly autistic but there's a lot of other ways to be neurodivergent. Regardless of how you think differently there are advantages and disadvantages of it. But the biggest disadvantage would be mitigated greatly if people just learned to talk with each other more honestly and with more interest in understanding the other people in the conversation.</p>  <p>I'm fairly adept at English though I frequently use word constructions others don't because I think differently. While I do sometimes use words wrong most of the time people think I say things incorrectly I am just trying to say something different than they expected. My most common mistakes are using phrases with hurtful connotations that I don't intend. I generally don't intend to say hurtful things. I'm sorry if it feels like I have.</p>  <p>I do know about the Wednesday thing but there's a lot of other things I don't know. And you can be sure that if I say today is Wednesday and it really isn't I've merely got the day of the week wrong and I don't really mean the other thing people mean when they say it's Wednesday. No I don't actually know what that thing is I just know it's used to mean something different. Somebody tried to explain it to me and it made no sense. I know it has something to do with people not realizing different people are different. But different people are different and that's OK. It's not just OK it's what makes the world work. That doesn't mean I approve of hate groups. Every hate group I've gotten to know has desperately wanted to change the world into something that couldn't possibly work. I like the world working. It's where I keep all of my stuff and spend all of my time.</p>  <p>I do not have even a survival level of knowledge in any other language meant for communicating with people. I've attempted German French Spanish Latin Japanese Chinese and Italian. That said I'm only really good at English because I've been working at mastering it for my whole life. I still remember everything I said being awkward so I'm not going to get mad at someone because their English is poor. I'm more likely to be impressed by them because I'm easily impressed by people who are multi-lingual.</p> ,0,1,0,15033289,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3R2h7RDJ9yU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYNkQa9HPTd778Jo28o4mlsEFPJpw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128

Oh it has taken too long...</p>  <p>The real problem behind the not for extensive discussions thing is probably that some answers on some subsites tries to appear formal and complete while in fact nobody knows an ideal answer. It could be still understandable on Workspace but obviously horrible on Parenting. Answers on some other websites that nobody ever wanted a discussion usually tries to appear informal to acknowledge that this might not be the perfect answer but hope it has helped you a bit. On the other hand they are more permissive to personal opinions and duplicates instead as a result.

All signs suggest this was an erroneous if not malicious decision not founded on fact which the company is completely failing to take any responsibility for. <a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/187282>This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in the community.</a></p>  <p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement or justifying their decision to terminate her for more than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk and others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica>dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Members of the Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf (<a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/333992/187282>1</a> <a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731/187282>2</a>).</p>  <p>So far Stack Overflow Inc. has met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>  <p><a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/187282>Having exhausted all other means of communication</a> Monica is now raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in her own interest but arguably also in the interest of the SO community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally actionable it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the company can do to its volunteers as well as be a symbolic slap in the face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the community that keeps it alive.</p>  <p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>  <p><strong>Consider supporting her today.</strong></p> ,1,5,0,8860436,https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZLo7.png?s=128&g=1

Therefore I'd recommend you instead <a href=http://google.com/search?q=Monica+Cellio+GoFundMe rel=nofollow noreferrer>google</a> Monica Cellio GoFundMe to find the link.</h2>      <p>A popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator Monica   Cellio <a href=https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193>was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133>portrayed to the   press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow Inc. All   signs suggest this was an erroneous if not malicious decision not   founded on fact which the company is completely failing to take any   responsibility for. <a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965>This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in   the community.</a></p>      <p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for   <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement or justifying their decision to terminate her for more   than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk and   others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica>dozens of constructive   suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Several members of the   Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf e.g. in <a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731>this prominent post</a>.</p>      <p>So far Stack Overflow Inc. has met all of this with thunderous   silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see   the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good   faith I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate   callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new   normal.</p>      <p><a href=https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526>Having exhausted all other means of communication</a> Monica is now   raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in   her own interest but arguably also in the interest of the SO   community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally   actionable it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the   company can do to its volunteers as well as be a symbolic slap in the   face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the   community that keeps it alive.</p>      <p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left   over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and   legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>      <p><strong><a href=http://google.com/search?q=Monica+Cellio+GoFundMe rel=nofollow noreferrer>Consider supporting her today.</a></strong></p> </blockquote> ,0,1,0,14066779,https://i.stack.imgur.com/QkBwR.png?s=128&g=1

Python was my first love a multiplatform programming language that's easy to read and has excellent documentation. I would study it and build tool and toy applications which lead me to first professional programming experience at thirteen and I have been a software contractor ever since. During high-school I learned PHP to work on an Open Source project a 3D Racing Game Server. This project brought me to Git and Github for version control and collaborating on other open source projects.</p>  <p>I wrote web scrapers spiders and other data mining tools for a price tracking service for two years. These were only twenty/thirty-hour weeks but the work of building product scraping tools is so tedious I started to focus on writing code that would help me generate them.</p>  <p>I have worked side by side university professors and a media team to push out course materials for Python Programming and Data Analysis on a tight deadline. Coursera published the courses as Specialization tracks.</p>  <p>I love collaborating with start-ups individuals and consultancies. I am always open to learning and new challenges which can make me grow as a collaborator and software developer especially when exposed to new technologies or solving unique problems for people and businesses. I have gravitated towards technology as a tool to can the biggest impact.</p>  <p>My web development weapons of choice are Flask or Django if I am working in Python Laravel or Phalcon if I am starting new projects in PHP and I use Express when working /w JavaScript/NodeJS.</p>  <p>I've been doing majority backend work but I've been studying and focusing on front-end with React and React-Native lately.</p>  <p>I also have quite a bit of experience /w Linux and have built myself a home networking lab to practice Penetration Testing and other security topics as a hobby so I am very interested in moving into Security or Linux Administration.</p> ,0,0,0,1127981,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f24693876231b5fa537a31394b940ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG

Some JS frameworks I've used include <code>Node</code> <code>jQuery</code> <code>Backbone</code> <code>Mithril</code> <code>Angular</code> and <code>React</code>.</p>  <p>My best language is <code>JavaScript</code>/<code>Node</code> and I do a lot of personal programming in <code>Go</code>. I like <code>JavaScript</code>/<code>Node</code> because it's like reading and writing a book which is my favorite and IMO the most important part of programming. I use <code>Go</code> when I want something insanely fast.</p>  <p>I haven't gotten around to learning <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code> because I haven't found a good enough reason to warrant the time and effort needed to write a program in <code>C++</code> when I can use <code>Node</code> or <code>Go</code>. It's like if <code>C++</code> is a Bugatti and <code>Go</code> is a Mercedes yeah the Bugatti is faster but I'd rather get the Mercedes for 1/5 of the price. <em>-EDIT- Technically a Mercedes is only 1/200 of the price which doesn't fit the analogy but is 12% slower which does fit the analogy.</em></p>  <p>Linux is my preferred environment but I like and use Mac and Windows too. I mainly use Arch Linux but I use Ubuntu in some environments.</p>  <p>I switch back and forth from Bash and ZSH because I can't decide on one.</p> ,0,1,0,4768718,https://i.stack.imgur.com/i1EYW.png?s=128&g=1

I have worked primarily with PHP MySQL Linux JavaScript AJAX Java Spring Framework and Python. I also have experience with computer hardware networking and computer troubleshooting on any operating system.</p>  <p>I pursue many side projects to continue to learn new programming languages and technologies. I'm very proud of my app that shows real time information about the Albuquerque bus system and it is used by at least 300 people every weekday. </p>  <p>My life as a programmer began in 2005 when I got my first book about PHP. I had been working on building my own computer as a hobby and I wanted to create a website that allowed the user to configure their own custom computer. The website also incorporated a MySQL Database. Maintaining that website continued as a hobby and I also taught myself some Javascript and C++. My in-depth exposure to programming began in 2008 at Washington University in St Louis where I began learning Java. I learned the importance of Algorithms and Object Oriented Programming and I was around other students who had programmed as a hobby. I have not earned my degree yet but I feel I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience from college.</p>  <p>I began to have an interest in iPhone Apps in 2009 and I started working on an App for the game Diplomacy which I have been interested in for a long time. Later when I got back to my home state of New Mexico I decided to work on some free apps to get my name out as a developer. I made an app to show the schedule for the New Mexico Rail Runner and in the summer of 2012 I participated in a hackathon where my team decided to work on a Bus tracking app based on the GPS data that the city of Albuquerque had recently made available. We created a web version at the hackathon and I have since made an android version. My current side project is making the iPhone version of the bus app.</p> ,0,0,0,2013182,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b64dd7716a9b4bd353553b0020e63987?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG
